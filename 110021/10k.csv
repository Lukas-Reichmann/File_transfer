Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee directors Daniel Wood (chairman), William Grounds, and William Roberts. Chris Adams served on the Compensation Committee during his directorship term through the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this report. Based on such review and discussions and relying thereon, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Daniel S. Wood (chairman) William W. Grounds William B. Roberts Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2022 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Outcome The Compensation Committee annually considers the results of the most recent advisory vote by shareholders to approve executive officer compensation. In the 2022 advisory vote, a majority of the voted shares (81%) approved of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee interprets that vote as a reason to retain the existing design, purposes and structure of our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive officer compensation in its future administration of executive compensation. Compensation Objectives The Company's objectives with respect to compensation are several. The significant objectives are to cause compensation (i) to be sufficient in total amount to provide reasonable assurance of retaining key executives, (ii) to include a significant contingent component, so as to provide strong incentives to meet designated Company objectives, and (iii) to include a significant component tied to the price of the Common Stock, so as to align management's incentives with shareholder interests. The compensation committee (""Committee"") of the Company's Board of Directors is charged with administering the Company’s compensation plans to meet those objectives. To the extent that elements of compensation would not advance such objectives, or would do so less effectively than would other elements, the Committee seeks to avoid paying compensation in those forms. Role of the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer Our Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, to make all decisions regarding executive compensation, including administration of our compensation plans. In that regard, the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is authorized to form subcommittee(s) and to retain experts and consultants to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. To date it has not done so. The chief executive officer, who attends meetings of the Compensation Committee by invitation of the Committee’s chairman, assists the Committee in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by, among other things: The other executive officers do not have a role in determining their own compensation, other than to discuss their annual individual performance objectives and results achieved with the chief executive officer. Our Overall Approach The Committee has put into place a compensation system consisting of three key components: base salary, an annual cash bonus pursuant to an incentive plan, and long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options. The table below provides comparative information regarding the components of our year 2022 executive compensation program. We are applying the same elements in our executive compensation program for the year 2023. Attract and retain high quality personnel Achieve objectives set annually Align interests of executives with those of shareholders; The Committee has from time to time considered providing additional elements of executive compensation. It has considered elements such as restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, compensation contingent on a change in control, defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation, and supplemental retirement plans (supplemental in the sense that they exceed the limits for tax advantaged treatment). To date, the Committee has elected not to pay compensation in such forms, having determined that the Company's objectives are better met by one or more of the elements of compensation that it does pay. Regarding restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Committee has noted that any form of equity equivalent to or closely tied to common stock does serve to meet the objective of aligning officers' personal interest with that of the shareholders generally. The Committee believes, however, that the objective is better met by grants of stock options than by grants of share equivalents, because recipients of the grants will face the same degree of variance in results at a lesser cost to the Company, when option grants are compared to grants of restricted stock units. Further, unlike restricted stock, option grants will not provide a reward to the holder absent an improvement over time in the Company’s stock price. The committee has elected not to provide material perquisites as compensation, having determined that cash is a better medium of exchange. Regarding compensation that would be payable contingent on a change in control of the Company, the Committee believes that there are certain legitimate objectives to be met by such contingent compensation. As of the date of this report, however, no such contingent compensation plans are in place. Regarding defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation and supplemental retirement plans, the Committee believes that the Company's retention objective is better met by straight cash payments, whether in the form of base salary or in the form of bonus compensation. In particular with respect to plans for deferred compensation, the Committee believes those make sense for the Company and for the recipient only on the basis of assumptions regarding future tax rates payable by each. Having no assurance that such assumptions would be correct, the Committee has chosen not to put into place any special deferred compensation programs for the company’s executive officers. Those officers do participate in a company-sponsored tax-deferred savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, on the same terms available to company employees generally. The Committee may in the future revisit its conclusions as to any of the components discussed above, or may consider other forms of compensation. The Base Salary Element With respect to the retention objective, the Committee considers an executive's base salary to be the most critical component. Acting primarily on the basis of recommendations of the chief executive officer, the Committee adjusts other officers' base salaries annually, with the adjustment generally consisting of a 2% to 10% increase from the prior year's rate. Where exceptional circumstances apply, such as recruitment of a new executive officer, a promotion to executive officer status or a special need to retain an individual officer, the chief executive officer may recommend, and the Committee may approve, a larger increase. The Company's general approach in setting the annual compensation of its named executive officers is to set those officers’ base compensation by reference to their base rates for the preceding year. During the year ended December 2022, the Company's chief executive officer, Charles E. Bradley, Jr., received $995,000 in base salary. In setting that rate in the first quarter of 2022, the Committee considered the base salary rate that the Company had paid in the prior year ($995,000), the desirability of providing an annual increase, the desirability of ensuring retention of the services of the Company's incumbent chief executive officer, the Company’s financial performance, and the levels of chief executive officer compensation prevailing among other financial services companies. The Committee considered whether to adjust officers’ base compensation for 2022, and determined not to increase the base rate for the chief executive officer or the other named executive officers. The Annual Incentive Bonus (EMB) Element To encourage executive officers and key management personnel to exercise their best efforts and management skills toward causing the Company to meet its overall objective, and toward achieving designated specific individual objectives, the Company has implemented an Executive Management Bonus Plan, with annual payouts. Under the Company's bonus plan as applied to the year ended December 2022, the Company’s executive vice presidents were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 140% of their base salaries, and the Company’s senior vice presidents were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 110% of their base salaries. The chief executive officer was eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 600% of his base salary. The implementation of this element for the named executive officers for the year 2022 is discussed below. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Element The Committee also awards incentive and non-qualified stock options under the Company's stock option plans. Such awards are designed to assist in the retention of key executives and management personnel and to create an incentive to create shareholder value over a sustained period of time. The Company believes that stock options are a valuable tool in compensating and retaining employees. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Committee granted stock options to the Company's executive officers. All such grants were awarded on January 24, 2022 and June 24, 2022, and all carry exercise prices equal to the market price for the Company’s common stock at the date of grant. The terms of such options are described below, under the caption “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year.” The numbers of shares made subject to each of the option grants were based on various factors relating to the responsibilities of the individual officers and to the extent of previous grants to such individuals. Because the exercise price of all options granted is equal to or above the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, the option holders may realize value only if the stock price appreciates from the price on the date the options were granted. This design is intended to focus executives on the enhancement of shareholder value over the long term. Other Elements The Company also maintains certain broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical and dental insurance, and a qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k) plan), in which executive officers are permitted to participate. Such officers participate on the same terms as non-executive personnel who meet applicable eligibility criteria, and are subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the benefits that may be payable under the plans. The Company does not maintain any form of defined benefit pension or retirement plan in which executive officers may participate, nor does it maintain any form of supplemental retirement savings or supplemental deferred compensation plan. Exercise of Discretion In exercising its discretion as to the level of executive compensation and its components, the Committee considers a number of factors. Members of the Committee conduct informal surveys of compensation paid to comparable executives within and without the consumer finance industry. The Committee finds these data useful primarily in evaluating the overall level of compensation paid or to be paid to the Company’s executive officers. Financial factors considered included earnings, revenue, originations, and budget attainment. Operational factors considered included individual and group management goals; indicators of the performance and credit quality of the Company's servicing portfolio, including levels of delinquencies and charge-offs; and indicators of successful management of personnel, including employee stability. All of such factors are assessed with reference to the judgment of the Committee as to the degree of difficulty of achieving desired outcomes. With respect to payment of annual bonuses and grants of stock options, the Committee also takes note of factors relating to the degree of the Company's success over the most recent year. Specific Objectives and Evaluation In the first quarter of 2022 the compensation committee designated specific objectives with respect to the chief executive officer to be accomplished within the year 2022, and fixed weights to be associated with each such objective. The chief executive officer proposed to the committee specific annual objectives with respect to each other executive officer of the company, which the committee, after making certain modifications, approved. These objectives and the Committee’s administration of the annual incentive bonus element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “ - Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year - Executive Management Bonus Plan.” Grants of Options The Committee's award of stock options to the Company's officers in January 2022 included option grants to the chief executive officer and in June 2022 included option grants to the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. In determining the appropriate level of such grant, the Committee considered the long-term performance of the chief executive officer and the desirability of providing significant incentive for future performance, as well as the desirability of ensuring that officer's continued retention by the Company, and the various factors noted above with respect to option grants generally. These grants and the Committee’s administration of the long-term incentive element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “-Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year – Equity Incentives.” Stock Ownership, Hedging and Pledging . Our board of directors and compensation committee have considered whether to establish a minimum stock ownership goal for members of our senior management. We have elected not to do so, considering that such a policy would either be strict and mandatory, in which case it would undermine the compensatory objectives of our equity compensation plans, or would be merely hortatory, in which case it could be expected to have little effect. We’ve also noted that the multiyear vesting terms of the equity incentives granted under our plans have the effect of aligning our executives’ individual personal financial incentives with the future price performance of the Company’s stock. As part of our comprehensive compliance policy, we remind all company executive officers of the mandatory legal prohibition on selling short company shares. We also prohibit company executive officers from entering into transactions that would have the effect of causing those individuals to benefit from a decline in the price of the company stock, such as the purchase of “put” options. We prohibit such “hedging” transactions but we do not find it appropriate to prohibit our executive officers from pledging their shares of company stock as security for a loan. We believe that the beneficial incentives of owning company stock remain substantially the same with or without such a pledge. Summary of Compensation The following table summarizes all compensation earned during the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 by the Company's chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and the other three most highly compensated individuals (such six individuals, the ""named executive officers"") who were serving in such position or as executive officers at any time in 2022. It lists their names, their principal positions in which they served in those years, and each component of compensation paid with respect to those years.

Value was estimated using a Black-Scholes model for 2020, 2021 and 2022. For the options granted on January 24, 2022, the weighted average fair value per option was $5.8558, based on assumptions of 4.11 years expected life, expected volatility of 75.26%, and a risk-free rate of 1.43%. For the options granted on June 24, 2022, the weighted average fair value per option was $4.98, based on assumptions of 4.11 years expected life, expected volatility of 75.15%, and a risk-free rate of 3.13%. For the year 2021 the weighted average fair value per option was $2.6510, based on assumptions of 4.11 years expected life, expected volatility of 71.38%, and a risk-free rate of 0.51%. For the year 2020 the weighted average fair value per option was $1.33, based on assumptions of 4.11 years expected life, expected volatility of 72.10%, and a risk-free rate of 0.26%. In all cases, we assumed a dividend yield of 0.0%. Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year Equity Incentives In the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not grant any stock awards or stock appreciation rights to any of our named executive officers. We granted options to the chief executive on January 24, 2022 (the “January Options”) and to substantially all of our executive officers on June 24, 2022. The option grants noted in the tables above and below were awarded to the named executive officers as part of those grants. We also granted awards under our Executive Management Bonus Plan, which were evaluated and paid out after the end of the year. The amounts paid are shown in the table above (Summary Compensation Table) as “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” In the January 24, 2022 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 750,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($10.32 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. The January Options were issued following cancellation of certain options granted to the chief executive officer in 2013. In the June 24, 2022 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($10.25 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. Each of the following executive officers of the Company received a grant on June 24,2022 on the same terms: Mr. Lavin received such a grant with respect to 90,000 shares, and Mr. Bharwani, Ms. Robinson and Ms. Straten each received such a grant with respect to 60,000 shares. The table below provides information regarding the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2022. Grants of Plan-Based Awards Number of Shares Underlying Options Grant Date Fair Value The “target” and “maximum” figures appearing in the table above represent the maximum cash payout under the individual executives’ Executive Management Bonus Plan awards as of the date the incentive was fixed. The actual payout to each individual named in the table above has been determined and paid prior to the date of this report. That amount was in almost each case less than the maximum (approximately 67% of the maximum, in the case of the chief executive). The respective actual payments are described below, and appear above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading “Non-Equity Plan Compensation.” Because each non-equity incentive plan award has been settled and paid, the future payout under such awards as of the date of this report is in each case zero. The “grant date fair value” figures appearing in the table above, which are the computed fair values of stock option awards, are computed as described in note 2 to the Summary Compensation Table. Executive Management Bonus Plan The Executive Management Bonus Plan award granted to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley, called for him to meet as many as possible of seven separate operational and financial objectives within the year 2022. The Compensation Committee assigned to each of those objectives a value as a percentage of base salary. The objectives and their weightings were as follows: to meet or exceed the Company’s quarterly budgeted earnings (25% each quarter, total of 100%), to execute four rated securitization transactions (25% each, 100% total), to increase the Company’s annual originations of receivables to each of four targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 25% for reaching aggregate amounts of $1.1 billion, $1.15 billion, $1.20 billion, and $1.25 billion), to originate $50 million each of non-prime and deep independent dealer paper (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 50% for each of the origination targets), to maintain the annualized delinquency rate or lower by one percent (25% if the rate is maintained or 50% if the rate is lowered by one percent ), to maintain the annualized loss rate or lower by one percent (25% if the rate is maintained or 50% if the rate is lowered by one percent) and to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in excess of each of four targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 25% for reaching prices of $12.00, $13.00, $14.00, and $15.00 per share). The total of the seven weightings is 600%; accordingly, the target and maximum possible value to that officer of the award was 600% of his base salary for 2022. In a series of meetings, the committee evaluated the chief executive’s performance in comparison to the goals. The Compensation Committee determined that the budget objective was met in three of the four quarters of 2022 and credited the chief executive with three quarters of the maximum value, or 75%. The Committee noted that the Company had executed four rated securitizations during the year, representing the full creditable performance of 100%. It determined that our originations volume exceeded $1.85 billion for the year, representing creditable performance in the full amount of 100%. The Committee noted that the Company exceeded the origination targets for non-prime and deep independent dealer paper and credited the chief executive with the full 100% designated for that objective. The Committee also determined that the annualized delinquency rates were not maintained or lowered and found no credit was earned in that respect. The Committee found that the annualized loss rate was lowered by less than one percent and credited the chief executive 25%. The Committee noted that the stock price objective was not met with respect to any of the four targets and found no credit was earned in that respect. The aggregate valuation of all creditable performance for the chief executive officer was thus 400%, which would imply a bonus payment under our Executive Management Bonus Plan of $3,980,000. The Committee determined that the Company’s record earnings for 2022 made it reasonable to refrain from a discretionary reduction in computed earned bonus, and approved payments to the chief executive of a cash bonus in the full implied amount. The Executive Management Bonus Plan awards granted to the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer are evaluated on a more subjective basis, and were set by the Compensation Committee in consultation with and on the recommendation of the chief executive officer. Factors used in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are executive vice presidents of the Company, including one of the named executive officers, Mr. Lavin, who was executive vice president of the Company in 2022 until Mr. Lavin’s promotion to president in December of 2022, are these: (I) an evaluation of the executive’s skills and performance, 30%, (II) whether the executive has met two individual objectives approved by the compensation committee, 18% in aggregate, (III) whether the Company as a whole has met or exceeded budget targets, 12%, (IV) a subjective evaluation of that executive’s departments, 30%, and (V) a discretionary allocation recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee, 50%. Mr. Fritz was not eligible to participate in the Executive Management Bonus Plan as a result of Mr. Fritz’s retirement as chief financial officer and executive vice president. Numerical scores are assigned to each of these factors, up to the maximum percentages stated above, and can result in a maximum bonus of 140% of base compensation. Similar factors are applied in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are senior vice presidents of the Company, including the named executive officers who served as senior vice presidents for the majority of 2022 until their promotions in the fourth quarter of 2022, Mr. Bharwani, Ms. Robinson, and Ms. Straten: (I) skills and performance, 30%, (II) two individual objectives, 18%, (III) Company budget, 12%, (IV) subjective evaluation of that executive’s department, 20%, and (V) discretionary allocation, 30%, resulting in a maximum bonus of 110% of base compensation. Following the end of the year 2022, our compensation committee evaluated each named executive officer’s performance in relation to these standards and goals. The Company met its overall annual budget target, and each officer accordingly received full credit with respect to that target. With respect to the individual factors, the compensation committee, acting in part on the advice of our chief executive officer, determined that creditable performance for 2022 for each named executive officer other than the chief executive officer was as set forth below: On that basis, the Compensation Committee approved payments to these named executive officers in the amounts shown in the rightmost column. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2022 the number of unexercised options held by each of the named executive officers, the number of shares subject to then exercisable and unexercisable options held by such persons and the exercise price and expiration date of each such option. Each option referred to in the table was granted at an option price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the date of grant. None of such individuals holds a stock award; accordingly, only information concerning option awards is presented. (1) Becomes exercisable as to the unexercisable portion on August 8, 2023. (2) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-half of the unexercisable portion on June 1, 2023 and 2024. (3) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-third of the unexercisable portion on August 3, 2023, 2024 and 2025. (4) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of 25% of the unexercisable portion on January 24, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. (5) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of 25% of the unexercisable portion on June 24, 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year All of the six named executive officers exercised stock options during 2022. The table below shows the realized value and the number of options exercised for those individuals. None of our officers hold stock awards; accordingly, no stock awards vested during 2022. Option Exercises and Stock Vested (1) The value realized is the difference between the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise (the closing price reported by Nasdaq) and the exercise price of the option. Executive Management Bonus Plan (Non-equity Incentive Plan) The salary and cash bonus of the named executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation appearing in the Summary Compensation Table above under the caption ""Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"" is paid pursuant to an executive management bonus plan (the “EMB Plan”). The EMB Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee selects participants in the EMB Plan from among the Company’s executive officers and determines the performance goals, target amounts and other terms and conditions of awards under the EMB Plan. With respect to officers other than the chief executive officer, determinations of base salary and of criteria relating to the EMB Plan are based in part on evaluations of such officers prepared by the chief executive officer, which are furnished to and discussed with the Compensation Committee. Director Compensation Throughout 2022, we paid our non-employee directors a retainer of $6,000 per month, with an additional fee of $700 per month for service on a board committee ($1,200 for a committee chairman). Non-employee directors also received per diem fees of $1,000 for attendance in person at meetings of the board of directors, or $500 for attendance by telephone. No per diem fees are paid for attendance at committee meetings. The Board in 2022 approved issuance to each non-employee director of options to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares. The exercise prices of all such options are the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which was $10.25 per share. The following table summarizes compensation received by our directors for the year 2022: Fees Earned or Paid in Cash (1) Pension Plans The Company's officers do not participate in any pension or retirement plan, other than a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (commonly known as a 401(k) plan). Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control This section provides information regarding payments and benefits to the named executive officers that would be triggered by termination of the officer’s employment (including resignation, or voluntary termination; severance, or involuntary termination; and retirement) or a change of control of the Company. Each of the named executive officers is an at-will employee and, as such, does not have an employment contract. In addition, if the officer’s employment terminates for any reason other than a change of control of the Company, any unvested stock options are terminated, and vested options become subject to accelerated expiration: ordinarily three months following separation from service, or twelve months in the case of disability, retirement or death. Accordingly, there are no payments or benefits that are triggered by any termination event (including resignation and severance) other than in connection with a change of control of the Company. Benefits Triggered by Change of Control or Termination after Change of Control Our stock option plans provide that each employee of ours who holds outstanding unexpired options under our stock option may have the right to exercise such options following a change of control of the Company, without regard to the date such option would first be exercisable. Each of the named executive officers holds such options. The “acceleration” of options is mandatory following certain changes of control, and subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee following certain others. Acceleration is mandatory in the event of (i) the sale, or other disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (ii) a merger or similar transaction in which shareholders of the Company hold less than 50% of the shares of the surviving entity; provided, however, that acceleration following a merger or similar transaction is mandatory only if the holder suffers a Qualifying Termination (defined below) within one year following the transaction, or if the surviving entity does not provide the holder with an equivalent award. Acceleration is also mandatory if a holder suffers a Qualifying Termination within one year following (iii) a change within a three-year period in the membership of a majority of the board of directors (excluding changes recommended by the board), or (iv) a person’s acquisition of outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than directly from the Company and without approval of the board, resulting in that person’s having beneficial ownership of greater than 25% of the Company. Under our stock option plans, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to provide for acceleration under other circumstances than those described above with respect to any particular stock option or class of stock options. The committee would expect to exercise its discretion with the intention of preserving the value of the stock option award. To date, such discretion has not been exercised. A “Qualifying Termination” is a termination of the holder’s employment by the Company other than for cause, disability or death, or by the holder for “good reason” (principally relating to a material diminution in the holder’s authority, compensation or responsibilities, or a relocation of greater than 50 miles). The preceding description applies to options held by officers and employees. Options issued to non-employee directors accelerate without the exercise of discretion upon any of the four categories of change of control described above. As of December 31, 2022, each of the named executive officers would realize a benefit if unvested stock options were to become immediately exercisable upon a change in control, based on the value of the shares underlying such options at the closing market price on December 30, 2022, which was $8.85 per share. The respective amounts of such possible benefit are set forth in the following table: Management Structure The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company. Its oversight is aimed at seeing to it that the Company’s business is managed to meet our goals, and that the interests of the shareholders are served. Charles E. Bradley, Jr. currently serves as both the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer, and is the only member of our board who is not independent of the Company. Our board has chosen not to designate any individual formally as the lead independent director. Each director retains his full oversight responsibility. Our board structure supports the independence of our non-management directors. Our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee are each composed solely of independent directors. Our bylaws provide that any two directors have the authority to call meetings of the board of directors, as do specified officers, including the president and the secretary. To enhance the possible use of that authority by independent directors, the corporate secretary is under standing instructions to call a meeting at the instance of any one director. The board believes that combining the chairman and chief executive officer positions is currently the most effective leadership structure given Mr. Bradley’s in-depth knowledge of our business and industry and his demonstrated ability to formulate and implement strategic initiatives. Mr. Bradley is continuously involved in developing and implementing our strategies, working closely with the company’s other senior executives to seek continued disciplined growth and excellence in operations. His close involvement in management places Mr. Bradley in the best position to decide which business issues require consideration by the independent directors of the board. In addition, having a combined chairman and chief executive officer enables us to speak with a unified voice to shareholders, customers and others concerned with our company. The board believes that combining the chief executive and chairman roles, as part of a governance structure that includes oversight of management responsibilities by independent directors, provides the preferred system for meeting the requirement that the Company be managed in the best interest of our shareholders. Risk Oversight The board’s overall responsibility for directing the management of the Company includes risk oversight. The risk oversight function is performed at the board level, and by the Audit and Compensation Committees. The board of directors as a whole in its regular meetings discusses and considers the risk inherent in the existing business of the Company and in proposed initiatives. Because the Company’s business consists of extending consumer credit to individuals believed to be of higher risk than others (sub-prime credit), the assessment of the risk assumed in such extensions of credit is a primary consideration on the part of the board. Risk oversight is also a key function of the Audit and Compensation Committees. The principal risk management function performed by the Audit Committee is the ongoing assessment of the credit estimates and allowances periodically recorded in the Company’s books. The committee reviews that assessment regularly. Other risk assessments performed by the Audit Committee include assessments of contingent liabilities, and of other reserves and allowances. The principal risk management functions performed by the Compensation Committee are its setting and evaluation of objectives for the chief executive officer, in connection with its administration of the executive management bonus plan. The committee recognizes that the company’s business of extending subprime credit inherently includes a conflict between growing the business and managing the risk of credit losses: one means to increase the company’s business is to offer credit on terms that are priced too low for the risk assumed. The Compensation Committee manages that risk by insisting that objectives to grow the business are qualified by a mandate that credit quality be maintained at appropriate levels. To some extent, such risk management is shared with the Audit Committee, which performs the primary oversight of whether credit risk assumed is reflected with adequate allowances in the Company’s financial statements. CEO Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a mandate that public companies disclose the ratio of the compensation of their CEO to their median employee. Our CEO-median employee pay ratio calculation for 2022 is 167:1. We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2022 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2022 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. There have been no changes to our employee population or compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio. Accordingly, we have computed the ratio by reference to the same employee who we identified as our median employee for the year 2020, who was determined using the compensation of employees who were actively employed on December 31, 2020. We then computed the ratio by reference to that employee’s total compensation for the year 2022, which was $65,150. The total compensation of the CEO Charles E. Bradley, Jr. in 2022 was $10,861,201. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The table below sets forth the number and percentage of shares of our Common Stock (our only class of voting securities) owned beneficially as of April 18, 2023 (the latest practicable date) by (i) each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director and each named executive officer, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers, as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property and similar laws, each of the persons named has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned by such persons. Percent of class is calculated by reference to 20,420,365 shares outstanding on April 18, 2023. Except as otherwise noted, each person named in the table has a mailing address at 3800 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 1400, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. Name and Address of Beneficial Owner *Less than 1% Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents inform a tion regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2022. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Subordinated Notes. The Company has offered and sold its subordinated notes in a continuous public offering. Executive officer Teri L. Robinson and former chief financial officer Jeff P. Fritz have purchased such notes directly from the Company in the offering, in each case on the same terms then offered to the public generally. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on Ms. Robinson’s notes in 2022 was $815,850. The amount of principal outstanding as of April 28, 2023 was $537,508. In 2022, the Company paid $907,689 of principal on such notes, which includes principal paid more than once due to the renewal of matured notes during the year. That same year, the Company paid $35,657 of interest at rates fixed at the time of purchase of each note. The interest rate on such notes ranges from 3.90% to 11.50%. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on Mr. Fritz’s notes in 2022 was $1,488,873. The amount of principal outstanding as of April 28, 2023 was $1,432,494. In 2022, the Company paid $526,058 of principal on such notes, which includes principal paid more than once due to the renewal of matured notes during the year. In that year, the Company paid $42,904 of interest at rates fixed at the time of purchase of each note. The interest rate on such notes ranges from 3.90% to 8.15%. Executive officer Steve Schween purchased such subordinated notes from the Company before he became an executive officer. The largest aggregate amount of principal outstanding on Mr. Schween’s note in 2022 was $665,460. The amount of principal outstanding as of April 28, 2023 was $665,460. In 2022, the Company paid $115,519 in interest at a rate fixed at the time of purchase of the note. The interest rate on the note is 12.25%. Other Transactions . In October 2022, before Mr. Schween became an executive officer, the Limited Liability Company of which Mr. Schween is a member entered into a one-year contract with the Company to provide vehicle data services to the Company. The approximate dollar amount involved in the transaction and Mr. Schween’s interest in the transaction is $130,000. Policy on Related Party Transactions and Director Independence. It is the Company's policy that transactions with related parties having a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company who personally benefit from such transactions may take place only if approved by the Audit Committee or by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are disinterested with respect to the transaction, and independent in accordance with the standards for director independence prescribed by Nasdaq. Such policy is maintained in writing in the charter of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has given general approval to executive officer purchases of subordinated notes that are on terms and rates then available to the public, including the purchases by Ms. Robinson and Mr. Fritz. The transactions with Mr. Schween were not subject to approval because they were entered into before Mr. Schween was an executive officer. The nine directors of the Company are Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Stephen H. Deckoff, Louis M. Grasso, William W. Grounds, Brian J. Rayhill, William B. Roberts, James E. Walker III, Gregory S. Washer, and Daniel S. Wood, of whom Messrs. Rayhill, Grasso, Washer, and Wood compose the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that other than Mr. Bradley (who is the Company's chief executive officer), each of the other eight directors is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Fees Paid to Auditors The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to the Company’s independent registered public accounting firms for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Crowe Horwath LLP has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since February 2009, and has reported on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2022. (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Audit-related fees comprise fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements. (3) The 2021 and 2022 tax fees represent services rendered in connection with preparation of state and federal tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Audit Committee Supervision of Principal Accountant The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and permitted non-audit fees to be paid to the independent auditor, and authorizes on behalf of the Company the payment of such fees, or refuses such authorization. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman and its vice-chairman the authority to approve performance of services on an interim basis. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, all services for which audit fees or audit related fees were paid were preapproved by the Audit Committee as a whole, or pursuant to such delegated authority. In the course of its meetings, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit fees outlined above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the audit firm, and has concluded that such independence is not and was not impaired.

Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have purchased a total of approximately $20.0 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2022 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois branches. Most of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They may work from our Irvine branch, our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we had 90 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications from 8,078 dealers in 47 states. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2022 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 3.2% of our total acquisitions and represented 2.7% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2022 approximately 91% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 9% consisted of financing for new cars. We generally solicit applications with the intent of originating contracts to hold as investments in our own portfolio. However, in May 2021 we began purchasing some contracts for immediate sale to a third-party to whom we refer applications that do not meet our lending criteria. We service all such contracts on behalf of the third-party. For contracts we originate for our own portfolio, we generally finance them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term securitizations of approximately $17.7 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2022, we had two such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $200 million. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency, and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received 2.5 million applications. Approximately 63% of all applications came through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 36% via another aggregator, Route One and 1% via our website. A portion of the DealerTrack and Route One volume are applications from our pass-through arrangements with other lenders who send us applications from their dealers in cases where those lenders choose not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, such pass-through applications represented 13% of our total applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history and an alternative data credit score provided by a major credit reporting bureau. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the applicant and structure of the automobile financing contract meets our criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. For applications that do not meet our criteria, we may forward them to one or more business partners who also invest in subprime automobile contracts. In the case of one third-party partner, as described above, we may purchase contracts they approve, followed by immediate resale to them, after which we retain the servicing. If this third-party declines the application, we advise the dealer that we will not purchase the contract. Other partners to whom we refer applications may or may not choose to purchase such contracts by working directly with the dealers who submitted the applications. Unless otherwise notated, contract origination and managed portfolio data discussed herein includes third-party contracts. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may be comprised of multiple components and which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on contracts purchased for our own portfolio for the periods shown: Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and maximizing our risk adjusted yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and by our pricing strategy. We make changes to our pricing algorithm based on our volume goals, our own costs for borrowing and periodic recalibration of our risk-based scoring models. We have offered eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Meta - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a stronger history of recent performing credit than the Preferred program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Preferred program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Meta, Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 80% of our new contract acquisitions for our own portfolio in 2022, 75% in 2021, and 75% in 2020, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract if the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy their repurchase obligations to us. Contract Funding For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our funding criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. Our technology and human expertise provides for a 360-degree evaluation of an applicant’s employment and residence stability, income level and affordability, and creditworthiness in relation to the desired collateral securing the automobile contract. This perspective is used to assign application and structure allowances and limits related to price, term, amount of down payment, monthly payment, and interest rate; type of vehicle; and principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle. Specifically, our funding guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 12 model years old or have more than 200,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 78 months, although we consider the program, amount financed, and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our funding staff verify the customer's employment, income, residency, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open-ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including traditional and alternative credit history, data derived from other sources such as house/rental payment, length of employment, residence stability and total income. When the dealer proposes a structure for the contract, our scores consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value, payment to income, make and model, vehicle class, and mileage. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Coronavirus Pandemic Beginning in April 2020, we experienced a decrease in monthly contract purchase volumes which continued through December 2020. Since January 2021, our contract purchase levels have returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Servicing and Collections We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts we service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; contacting obligors whose payments are late; accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; skip tracing; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. For contracts that we securitize, we are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. For contracts we service for third parties, we receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5%, and certain other incentive fees tied to credit performance. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We engage a nearshore third-party call center to supplement the efforts the collectors in our five branch locations. As of December 31, 2022, our nearshore partner had approximately 33 agents assigned to our portfolio. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our risk-based assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond to our collector’s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector attempts to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of repossessions is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts where the vehicle has been repossessed and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition, we apply a specific reserve to such contracts so that the net balance represents the estimated remaining balance after the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle are applied, net of related costs. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale, the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of late payments is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent. We do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower, regardless of their stage of delinquency are first applied to outstanding accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 25 months, 23 months, and 23 months as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as pandemic, recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession, and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we own as of the respective dates shown. Delinquency, Repossession and Extension Experience Delinquency and Extension Experience (1) Total Managed Portfolio (Excludes Third Party Portfolio) Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than eight over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. During 2020 we incorporated an algorithmic extension score card which provides our staff with an objective and quantitative assessment of whether or not a obligor is a good candidate for an extension, based on the current circumstances of the account. The extension score card was developed by our internal risk management team and is derived from the post-extension performance of accounts in our managed portfolio. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2022, for accounts that received extensions from 2012 through 2021: We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off as of December 31, 2022 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted, and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, despite the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Recent Asset-Backed Securitizations From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The remaining balance on the notes were paid in full on February 16, 2022. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in three CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from January 2018 through July 2018, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the eight CPS securitizations conducted from December 2018 through September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. As of December 31, 2022, the notes had a principal balance of $50.0 million. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July 2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from $100 million to $200 million at the July 2022 renewal. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from $100 million to $200 million. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with several national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. We are subject to supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Human Capital We rely on our employees for everything we do. To make our business work, we seek to supply them with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to new hire training, we provide mentor programs and management workshops. Workforce Allocation and Diversity We had 792 employees as of December 31, 2022. Our employee population was 66% female, and 67% self-identified as ethnically diverse (defined as all EEOC classifications other than white). Broken out by function, our human capital was allocated thus: 11 were senior management personnel; 407 were servicing personnel; 182 were automobile contract origination personnel; 127 were sales personnel and program development (78 of whom were sales representatives); 65 were various administrative personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. Compensation and benefits Our compensation policy is to be market competitive. We offer a benefits and wellness package that includes healthcare coverage, defined contribution retirement benefits, and other components. Employee Engagement Our means of evaluating our human capital resources include, on an individual basis, annual performance reviews and annual meetings with senior management on or close to the employee’s anniversary date. On an aggregate basis, a new hire survey and department round table meetings. The feedback from the meetings and survey results are reviewed by senior management and used to assist in reviewing our human capital strategies, programs, and practices. Other metrics used in human capital management include average employee tenure and annual turnover rate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Available Information Our internet address is www.consumerportfolio.com . We make available free of charge on our internet web site our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2023. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been from time to time in the past and may be in the future materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2023; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the eleven fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. We depend on various financing sources, including credit facilities, our securitization program and other secured and unsecured debt issuances, to finance our business operations. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $200 million. Both warehouse credit facilities have a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. Our access to financing sources depends upon our financial position, general market conditions, availability of bank liquidity, the bank regulatory environment, our compliance with covenants imposed under our financing agreements, the credit quality of the collateral we can pledge to support secured financings, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to maintain warehouse or securitization financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our Substantial Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Health and Prevent Us From Fulfilling Our Obligations Under Our Existing Indebtedness We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2,469.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $285.3 million of warehouse lines of credit, $49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and $25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. Our ability to make payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, and our ability to enter into additional credit facilities and securitization transactions as well as other debt financings, which, to a certain extent, are subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. The degree to which we are leveraged creates risks, including: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. We experienced improvements in the capital markets from 2010 through 2019, during which time we completed 36 securitizations. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2023. However, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we would expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such a reduction, if it should occur, could have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations May be Affected by Changing Economic Conditions We are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods also may be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, inflation, decreased demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding receivables, which weakens collateral values and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit, changes in vehicle ownership trends and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue. No assurance can be given that the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ will afford adequate protection against these risks. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. We sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the United States. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result in, or increase, a loss upon our disposition of repossessed vehicles and we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency balances. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result from manufacturer incentives or discounts on new vehicles, financial difficulties of new vehicle manufacturers, discontinuance of vehicle brands and models, increased used vehicle inventory resulting from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories and increased trade-ins due to promotional programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, higher gasoline prices may decrease the wholesale auction values of certain types of vehicles. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or low retail demand could result in higher losses for us. Further, we are dependent on the efficient operation of the wholesale auction markets. If the operations of the wholesale auction markets are disrupted, as they were during the recent COVID 19 pandemic, we may be unable to sell our used vehicles at sufficient volume and/or pricing. The number of delinquencies, defaults, losses and repossessions on sub-prime automobile receivables has historically been significantly influenced by the employment status of obligors on automobile loan contracts. Any general weakness in the economy may affect sub-prime obligors more strongly than the population as a whole. Furthermore, the global financial markets have at times experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various countries. Concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread to other countries at any time. There can be no assurance that this uncertainty relating to the sovereign debt of various countries will not lead to further disruption of the financial and credit markets in the United States, which could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. A deterioration in economic conditions and certain economic factors, such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, interest rates, housing prices, energy prices (including the price of gasoline), increased consumer indebtedness (including of obligors on the receivables), lack of available credit, the rate of inflation (such as the recent increase in inflation) and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors, such as terrorist events, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, public health emergencies, extreme weather conditions or significant changes in the geopolitical environment (such as the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia) and/or public policy, including increased state, local or federal taxation, could adversely affect the ability and willingness of obligors to meet their payment obligations under the receivables we originate. Our operating results could be adversely affected if obligors are unable to make timely payments on their receivables or if we elect to, or are required to, implement forbearance programs in connection with obligors suffering a hardship (including hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic conditions). The above described negative economic factors, as well as others, have also historically resulted in decreased consumer demand for motor vehicles, which may result in an increase in the inventory of used motor vehicles and depress the price at which repossessed motor vehicles may be sold or delay the timing of those sales. If the default rate on our receivables increases and the price at which the vehicles may be sold at auction declines, our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions may be adversely affected. If Interest Rates Rise, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our principal means of financing our portfolio of automobile contracts is to issue asset-backed notes in securitizations. The interest payable on such notes is our largest expense. Although such expense is fixed with respect to issued securitization trust debt, the terms of future securitizations may vary. The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates multiple times in 2022, once in early 2023, and is expected to continue to raise rates further in 2023. If interest rates on risk-free debt continue to increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, If interest rates in general should rise, our expenses would likewise rise, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. For our receivables originated prior to January 2018, we maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated.. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Receivables originated since January 2018 are recorded at fair value and incorporate estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a fair value adjustment to those receivables or reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at their own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. A host of state and local governmental agencies have jurisdiction over material portions of our business, and might take action adverse to us. No assurance can be given as to whether any of such hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. Existing law, regulations and interpretations may change in ways that increase our costs of compliance. In addition to direct costs, such compliance requires changes in forms, processes, procedures, controls and in the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may adopt new investment policies or otherwise impose new expectations that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors, any or all of which may have negative effects on our business and/or reputation. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables executed after December 2016 have been and will be subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage, our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the FTC, the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the recorded value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous recorded value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Recorded Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our recorded value, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Have Adverse Effects The COVID-19 virus has spread (“the pandemic”) throughout the world. The pandemic has had adverse effects on the economy of the United States (notably a significant decrease in employment) and the global economy in general. The long-term effects of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the pandemic are unknown. The extent to which obligors on our automobile contracts may be adversely affected by the pandemic (including a resurgence due to variants of COVID-19), by loss of employment, and by related efforts of governments to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout the nation and world cannot be predicted. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the ability of obligors to make timely payments to us. Finally, and depending on the extent to which the pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to our business or operations, the ability or willingness of our customers to make timely payments, and risks of geographic concentrations. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Effect of Social, Economic and Other Factors on Losses. The ability of our customers to make payments on automobile contracts will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors, most notably the extent to which our customers remain gainfully employed. Other economic factors include interest rates, general unemployment levels, the rate of inflation, adjustments in monthly mortgage payments and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally and the effect of government stimulus programs and consumer protection/payment relief efforts implemented in connection with the COVID-19 virus. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, consumer attitudes toward bankruptcy and the repayment of indebtedness and consumer perceptions of political events and shifts, which may be affected by the pandemic. We are generally unable to determine whether or to what extent economic or social factors will affect the performance of our portfolio of automobile contracts, but caution that a recession or depression in local, regional or national economies would be expected to increase delinquencies and losses, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2022, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 6.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 31%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

See "" Where You Can Find More Information "" and "" Documents Incorporated by Reference. "" Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.8 million through 2023. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 69,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $2.5 million through 2024. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Oak Brook, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2023 to 2029. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.4 million. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. Massachusetts Civil Investigative Demand . In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the Company’s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating with the inquiry. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2022 is $4.9 million, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2022 does not exceed $11.2 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

[Reserved] Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have originated a total of approximately $20.0 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2022 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Contract Purchases and Outstanding Managed Portfolio Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our recent history of term securitizations is summarized in the table below: Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations Amount of Receivables Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July 2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from $100 million to $200 million at the July 2022 renewal. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from $100 million to $200 million. We previously had a third facility. This $100 million facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in February 2021 and elected not to renew it. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. In a securitization, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Term Securitizations, (d) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (e) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a $15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic had not materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result, on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also, because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( "" spread account "" ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2022, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2022, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $11.2 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term securitizations of approximately $17.7 billion in contracts. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently, we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020 and four securitizations in each of 2021 and 2022. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenues were $329.7 million, an increase of $61.9 million, or 23.1%, from the prior year revenues of $267.8 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is the increase in interest income resulting from the increase in the average outstanding balance of finance receivables measured at fair value. In addition, mark ups to the finance receivables measured at fair value also contributed to the increase in revenues during the year. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 include a $15.3 million mark up to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The marks are estimates based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and increases or decreases in our estimates of future net losses. Results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 included the $15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic had not materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result, on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the prior year period include a $4.4 million mark down to the fair value portfolio. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 include a $4.4 million mark down to the fair value portfolio. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $39.0 million, or 14.6%, to $305.2 million from $266.2 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the 32.5% increase in the average balance of finance receivables measured at fair value over the prior year period. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Other income was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This 54.1% increase was primarily driven by the increase in origination and servicing fees we earned from third party receivables that we began originating in May 2021. These fees were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $1.3 million in the prior year period. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $202.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $11.5 million, or 5.7%. The increase is primarily due to increases in interest expense, sales expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Reductions in provisions for credit losses offset some of the increase in operating expenses. Employee costs increased by $3.7 million or 4.7%, to $84.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, representing 39.5% of total operating expenses. Employee costs were $80.5 million in the prior year, or 39.9% of total operating expenses. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2022 and 2021: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $37.6 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 8.7%, compared to the previous year and represented 17.6% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $12.3 million to $87.5 million, or 16.3%, compared to $75.2 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 41.0% of total operating expenses in 2022. The primary reason for the increase in interest expense is the increase in interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit and securitization trust debt. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.2 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt increased 11.0% to $2,020.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have increased in 2022 after decreasing in 2021. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit was $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $4.4 million in the prior year. Lower rates were offset by higher utilization of our credit lines during the year compared to last year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $130.1 million during 2022 compared to $51.3 million in 2021. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3.8 million in the prior year as the average balance has increased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes decreased by $297,000, or 11.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $25.3 million in the prior year to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Total Change Change Due to Rate The annualized yield on our finance receivables was 12.0% for 2022 compared to 12.4% in 2021. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these fair value receivables was $2,388.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,802.6 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $28.1 million compared to $14.6 million in 2021. The reserve decreases were primarily due to improved credit performance for these receivables. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers. Sales expense increased by $6.2 million to $23.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and represented 10.8% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,854.4 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,146.3 million in the prior year period. Occupancy expenses decreased by $180,000 or 2.3%, to $7.5 million compared to $7.7 million in the previous year and represented 3.5% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $57,000 or 3.4%, to $1.6 million compared to $1.7 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $30.2 million, representing a 26% effective tax rate. In the prior period, our income tax expense was $18.2 million, representing a 28% effective tax rate. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $267.8 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 1.2%, from the prior year revenues of $271.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $28.7 million, or 9.7%, to $266.3 million from $295.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our legacy portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an average of 20.2%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Interest Yield Interest Yield Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are net of mark downs of $4.4 million and $29.5 million, respectively, to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. Other income was $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $202.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $251.0 million for the prior year, a decrease of $49.0 million, or 19.5%. The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in interest expense and provisions for credit losses. Employee costs increased by $336,000 or 0.4%, to $80.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 39.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.2 million for the prior year, or 31.9% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for 2021 include approximately $8.0 million for the establishment of a bonus pool for a segment of employees we classify as Managers. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021 and 2020: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared to the previous year and represented 17.1% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $26.1 million to $75.2 million, or 25.8%, compared to $101.3 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 37.2% of total operating expenses in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense is the decrease in securitization trust debt interest. Interest on securitization trust debt decreased by $23.6 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 9.8% to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally decreased since 2019 and have stayed relatively low in 2021 despite trending upward throughout the year. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 4.4% for 2020. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $3.2 million, or 42.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $51.3 million during 2021 compared to $92.5 million in 2020. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million in the prior year as the average balance has increased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes increased by $466,000, or 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $19.3 million in the prior year to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 202 Compared to December 31, 2020 Total Change Change Due to Rate The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,802.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,631.5 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. In the prior year period, we recorded an increase to provision for credit losses for $14.1 million. That provision represented our estimate in 2020 of additional forecasted losses that might be incurred as a result of the pandemic on our portfolio of finance receivables. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded upon our adoption of CECL in January 2020. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense increased by $2.7 million to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,146.3 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $742.6 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Since then, our contract purchase volumes have gradually increased to pre-pandemic levels. Occupancy expenses increased by $294,000 or 4.0%, to $7.7 million compared to $7.4 million in the previous year and represented 3.8% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $109,000 or 6.1%, to $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operating expenses. Income tax expense was $18.2 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $680,000 and $8.8 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense for 2021 would have been $18.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 29%. For 2020, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 36%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $215.9 million, $198.2 million and $238.8 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $713.9 million and $115.4 million, respectively. This compares to net cash provided by investing activities of $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $1,673.2 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $1,107.5 million and $739.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Net cash provided by financing activities were $484.2 million in 2022. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $50.4 million and $328.5 million, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $1,411.0 million in new securitization trust debt in 2022 compared to $1,110.7 million in 2021 and $714.5 million in 2020. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,060.1 million, $1,153.1 million and $1,010.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash of $13.5 million and $114.7 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $22.1 million of such eligible collateral. During 2022, we completed four securitizations aggregating $1,411.0 million of notes sold. In January 2023, we completed another securitization with $324.8 million of notes sold. Cash proceeds from this securitization were used to pay down the outstanding balance on our two warehouse credit facilities thus increasing the amounts available for borrowing under these facilities. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. Our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2,469.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $285.3 million of warehouse lines of credit, $49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and $25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): We anticipate repaying debt due in 2023 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0% of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 4.75% per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to 8.50% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50% per annum. In July 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $150.3 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.00% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.15% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15% per annum. On February 2, 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $137.6 million outstanding under this facility. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The notes were paid off in February 2022. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50 million securitization of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2022 there was $50.0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 45 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2022 there were $25.3 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""estimates,"" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the ability of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts; and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have usually structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We may continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

WOOD March 15, 2023 /s/ DENESH BHARWANI Denesh Bharwani, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Reference REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Las Vegas, Nevada Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements"") 2 . We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Loans at Fair Value As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company carries all finance receivables acquired after 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company had $2.4 billion in finance receivables that are carried at fair value, all of which are classified as level 3 fair values as they contain one or more inputs which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. With assistance from an outside valuation expert, the Company used a level 3 fair value methodology for the fair value of finance receivables. The significant assumptions used by the Company to calculate the fair value of these financial receivables include the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivables. These significant assumptions were based on the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. We identified the valuation of finance receivables carried at fair value as a critical audit matter as this estimate requires subjective auditor judgment. Our principal considerations in making this determination are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by the Company in determining the assumptions to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these finance receivables, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of loans at fair value included addressing: Substantively testing management's process, including evaluating management’s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of loans at fair value included: Allowance for Finance Credit Losses – Qualitative Factors Related to the CECL Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a gross receivables portfolio of $92.3 million and a related allowance for finance credit losses (ACL) on loans of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management estimates the allowance using relevant information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on the calendar quarter of origination is used to estimate expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. This estimate is adjusted by certain qualitative factors that may impact future credit losses. The qualitative factors represent management’s estimate of the impact of future losses. The use of qualitative factors to adjust historical losses for management’s forecast requires significant judgment. Management applies qualitative factors to adjust its estimation of the timing and amount losses to represent its future economic forecast. We identified auditing the reasonableness of qualitative factors used to create forecasts in its credit loss model as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included addressing: Substantively testing management's process, including evaluating management’s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included: /s/ Crowe LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (""CPS"") was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company"") specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts (""Contracts"") originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers (""Dealers"") located throughout the United States. Customers located in California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Indiana represented 8.2 %, 7.8 %, 7.6 %, 5.7 %, 5.1 %, 4.6 %, and 4.6 % respectively, of contracts purchased during 2022 compared with 10.9 %, 6.1 %, 9.3 %, 3.6 %, 5.0 %, 4.6 %, and 5.0 % respectively in 2021. No other state had a concentration in excess of 4.6% in 2022. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80% owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2022, our unrestricted cash balance was $ 13.5 million , which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 include a $ 15.3 million positive mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $ 4.4 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for current expected credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the recorded value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $ 571,000 and $ 2.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. T reatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "" overcollateralization "" of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: Earnings Per Share Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the related period. The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Incremental shares of 1.2 million , 5.7 million and 13.6 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation , that generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of stock options, restricted stock or other equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is recognized for awards issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. This cost is recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These are material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. Financial Covenant s Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2022, which represents our estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 149.3 million and $ 146.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $ 56.8 million and $ 49.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key terms such as interest rate, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: Finance receivables totaling $ 2.0 million and $ 2.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. Allowance for Credit Losses – Finance Receivables The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. We measure the weighted average monthly incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant historical period, we consider each pool’s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the results of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool’s most recent actual cumulative net loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on older vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history, job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly, for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics between various segments of our portfolio. Our methodology incorporates historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore, the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape, the Company’s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. In consideration of the depth and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently, we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those factors into our estimates. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of our finance receivables by annual vintage as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At the adoption of CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $ 127.0 million . In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. The Company recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $ 28.1 million and $ 14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance, an improved macroeconomic outlook and higher used car prices. The Company made additional provisions for credit losses of $ 14.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. Those reserve increases were made in consideration for the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $ 1,618,000 , $ 1,675,000 , and $ 1,784,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (5) Securitization Trust Debt We have completed numerous term securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these transactions is shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Securitization trust debt,” and the components of such debt are summarized in the following table: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 14.2 million and $ 12.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2022. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2022, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $ 149.3 million . Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are summarized below: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 2.6 million and $ 400,000 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 86.0% of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 4.75% per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to 8.50% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50% per annum. In July 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 150.3 million outstanding under this facility. On February 2, 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.00% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.15% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15% per annum. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 137.6 million outstanding under this facility. The total outstanding debt on our two warehouse lines of credit was $ 287.9 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $ 106.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $ 50 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $ 50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 50.0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 377,000 and $ 629,000 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of our outstanding subordinated renewable notes as of December 31, 2022: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2022, we purchased 4,139,664 shares of our common stock at an average price of $ 11.11 . In January, March, and July 2022 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 35.0 million of our common stock. There is approximately $ 8.3 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015, July 2018 and again in November 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000, 19,200,000 and 22,200,000 , respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 5.42 , $ 2.65 , and $ 1.33 , respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 75 % to 80 % for 2022, 79 % to 71 % for 2021, and 72 % to 80 % for 2020. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $ 4.4 million , $ 2.0 million and $ 1.9 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $ 9.5 million . This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $ 11.2 million and $ 13.1 million , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $ 7.8 million and $ 9.7 million , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 23.4 million and $ 9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2022 and cash of $ 15.3 million was received. At December 31, 2022, there were a total of 2,661,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 for stock options under the 2006 and 1997 plans is as follows: The following table presents the price distribution of stock options outstanding and exercisable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: We did not issue any stock options with an exercise price above or below the market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 10.2 million as of December 31, 2022 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $10.2 million consists of approximately $ 7.0 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $ 3.2 million of net state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $ 42.4 million . These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2023. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2022, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. (10) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, equipment, software and hardware. The Company has entered into operating leases for the majority of its real estate locations, primarily office space. These leases are generally for periods of three to seven years with various renewal options. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine if a contract contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the leases expense included in Occupancy, General and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: The following table presents the supplemental cash flow information related to leases: Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. Massachusetts Civil Investigative Demand . In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the Company’s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating with the inquiry. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2022 is $ 4.9 million , and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2022 does not exceed $ 11.2 million . Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (11) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $ 2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $ 1.3 million , $ 1.3 million , and $ 1.4 million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25 % per annum as of December 31, 2022. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The estimated net gain that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2023 is $ 169,000 . The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. Cash Flows CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category, is as follows: ________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (12) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2022, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $ 1.9 million . We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $ 1.3 million , which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 30 %, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $ 571,000 . The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2021 was $ 2.5 million after applying a valuation adjustment of $ 1.9 million . There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2022 and 2021. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13) Subsequent Events On January 25, 2023 we executed our first securitization of 2023. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $324.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by $362.9 million in automobile receivables originated by CPS. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2023-A, consist of five classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Standard & Poor’s and DBRS Morningstar, and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and CPS’s experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 6.82%. The 2023-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance and overcollateralization of 10.50%. The transaction agreements require accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 14.00% of the original receivable pool balance, or 38.00% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. ",0000889609,CPSS

Business Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have purchased a total of approximately $20.0 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2022 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois branches. Most of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They may work from our Irvine branch, our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2022, we had 90 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications from 8,078 dealers in 47 states. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2022 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 3.2% of our total acquisitions and represented 2.7% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2022. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2022 approximately 91% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 9% consisted of financing for new cars. We generally solicit applications with the intent of originating contracts to hold as investments in our own portfolio. However, in May 2021 we began purchasing some contracts for immediate sale to a third-party to whom we refer applications that do not meet our lending criteria. We service all such contracts on behalf of the third-party. For contracts we originate for our own portfolio, we generally finance them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term securitizations of approximately $17.7 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2022, we had two such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $200 million. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency, and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we received 2.5 million applications. Approximately 63% of all applications came through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 36% via another aggregator, Route One and 1% via our website. A portion of the DealerTrack and Route One volume are applications from our pass-through arrangements with other lenders who send us applications from their dealers in cases where those lenders choose not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, such pass-through applications represented 13% of our total applications. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history and an alternative data credit score provided by a major credit reporting bureau. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the applicant and structure of the automobile financing contract meets our criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. For applications that do not meet our criteria, we may forward them to one or more business partners who also invest in subprime automobile contracts. In the case of one third-party partner, as described above, we may purchase contracts they approve, followed by immediate resale to them, after which we retain the servicing. If this third-party declines the application, we advise the dealer that we will not purchase the contract. Other partners to whom we refer applications may or may not choose to purchase such contracts by working directly with the dealers who submitted the applications. Unless otherwise notated, contract origination and managed portfolio data discussed herein includes third-party contracts. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2022, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may be comprised of multiple components and which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on contracts purchased for our own portfolio for the periods shown: Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and maximizing our risk adjusted yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and by our pricing strategy. We make changes to our pricing algorithm based on our volume goals, our own costs for borrowing and periodic recalibration of our risk-based scoring models. We have offered eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Meta - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a stronger history of recent performing credit than the Preferred program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Preferred program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Meta, Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 80% of our new contract acquisitions for our own portfolio in 2022, 75% in 2021, and 75% in 2020, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract if the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy their repurchase obligations to us. Contract Funding For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our funding criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. Our technology and human expertise provides for a 360-degree evaluation of an applicant’s employment and residence stability, income level and affordability, and creditworthiness in relation to the desired collateral securing the automobile contract. This perspective is used to assign application and structure allowances and limits related to price, term, amount of down payment, monthly payment, and interest rate; type of vehicle; and principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle. Specifically, our funding guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 12 model years old or have more than 200,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 78 months, although we consider the program, amount financed, and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our funding staff verify the customer's employment, income, residency, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open-ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including traditional and alternative credit history, data derived from other sources such as house/rental payment, length of employment, residence stability and total income. When the dealer proposes a structure for the contract, our scores consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value, payment to income, make and model, vehicle class, and mileage. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Coronavirus Pandemic Beginning in April 2020, we experienced a decrease in monthly contract purchase volumes which continued through December 2020. Since January 2021, our contract purchase levels have returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Servicing and Collections We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts we service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; contacting obligors whose payments are late; accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; skip tracing; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. For contracts that we securitize, we are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. For contracts we service for third parties, we receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5%, and certain other incentive fees tied to credit performance. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We engage a nearshore third-party call center to supplement the efforts the collectors in our five branch locations. As of December 31, 2022, our nearshore partner had approximately 33 agents assigned to our portfolio. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our risk-based assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond to our collector’s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector attempts to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of repossessions is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts where the vehicle has been repossessed and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition, we apply a specific reserve to such contracts so that the net balance represents the estimated remaining balance after the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle are applied, net of related costs. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale, the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of late payments is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent. We do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower, regardless of their stage of delinquency are first applied to outstanding accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 25 months, 23 months, and 23 months as of December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as pandemic, recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession, and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we own as of the respective dates shown. Delinquency, Repossession and Extension Experience Delinquency and Extension Experience (1) Total Managed Portfolio (Excludes Third Party Portfolio) Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than eight over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. During 2020 we incorporated an algorithmic extension score card which provides our staff with an objective and quantitative assessment of whether or not a obligor is a good candidate for an extension, based on the current circumstances of the account. The extension score card was developed by our internal risk management team and is derived from the post-extension performance of accounts in our managed portfolio. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2022, for accounts that received extensions from 2012 through 2021: We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off as of December 31, 2022 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted, and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, despite the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Recent Asset-Backed Securitizations From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The remaining balance on the notes were paid in full on February 16, 2022. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in three CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from January 2018 through July 2018, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the eight CPS securitizations conducted from December 2018 through September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. As of December 31, 2022, the notes had a principal balance of $50.0 million. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July 2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from $100 million to $200 million at the July 2022 renewal. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from $100 million to $200 million. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with several national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. We are subject to supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Human Capital We rely on our employees for everything we do. To make our business work, we seek to supply them with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to new hire training, we provide mentor programs and management workshops. Workforce Allocation and Diversity We had 792 employees as of December 31, 2022. Our employee population was 66% female, and 67% self-identified as ethnically diverse (defined as all EEOC classifications other than white). Broken out by function, our human capital was allocated thus: 11 were senior management personnel; 407 were servicing personnel; 182 were automobile contract origination personnel; 127 were sales personnel and program development (78 of whom were sales representatives); 65 were various administrative personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. Compensation and benefits Our compensation policy is to be market competitive. We offer a benefits and wellness package that includes healthcare coverage, defined contribution retirement benefits, and other components. Employee Engagement Our means of evaluating our human capital resources include, on an individual basis, annual performance reviews and annual meetings with senior management on or close to the employee’s anniversary date. On an aggregate basis, a new hire survey and department round table meetings. The feedback from the meetings and survey results are reviewed by senior management and used to assist in reviewing our human capital strategies, programs, and practices. Other metrics used in human capital management include average employee tenure and annual turnover rate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Available Information Our internet address is www.consumerportfolio.com . We make available free of charge on our internet web site our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2023. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been from time to time in the past and may be in the future materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2023; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the eleven fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. We depend on various financing sources, including credit facilities, our securitization program and other secured and unsecured debt issuances, to finance our business operations. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $200 million. Both warehouse credit facilities have a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. Our access to financing sources depends upon our financial position, general market conditions, availability of bank liquidity, the bank regulatory environment, our compliance with covenants imposed under our financing agreements, the credit quality of the collateral we can pledge to support secured financings, and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to maintain warehouse or securitization financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our Substantial Indebtedness Could Adversely Affect Our Financial Health and Prevent Us From Fulfilling Our Obligations Under Our Existing Indebtedness We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2,469.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $285.3 million of warehouse lines of credit, $49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and $25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. Our ability to make payments of principal or interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance, and our ability to enter into additional credit facilities and securitization transactions as well as other debt financings, which, to a certain extent, are subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, capital markets and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity and results of operations. The degree to which we are leveraged creates risks, including: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. We experienced improvements in the capital markets from 2010 through 2019, during which time we completed 36 securitizations. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2023. However, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we would expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such a reduction, if it should occur, could have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations May be Affected by Changing Economic Conditions We are subject to changes in general economic conditions that are beyond our control. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, delinquencies, defaults, repossessions and losses generally increase. These periods also may be accompanied by increased unemployment rates, inflation, decreased demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding receivables, which weakens collateral values and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default. Additionally, higher gasoline prices, declining stock market values, unstable real estate values, increasing unemployment levels, general availability of consumer credit, changes in vehicle ownership trends and other factors that impact consumer confidence or disposable income could increase loss frequency and decrease demand for automobiles as well as weaken collateral values on certain types of automobiles. In addition, during an economic slowdown or recession, our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue. No assurance can be given that the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ will afford adequate protection against these risks. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, defaults, repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. We sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the United States. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result in, or increase, a loss upon our disposition of repossessed vehicles and we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency balances. Depressed wholesale prices for used automobiles may result from manufacturer incentives or discounts on new vehicles, financial difficulties of new vehicle manufacturers, discontinuance of vehicle brands and models, increased used vehicle inventory resulting from significant liquidations of rental or fleet inventories and increased trade-ins due to promotional programs offered by new vehicle manufacturers. Additionally, higher gasoline prices may decrease the wholesale auction values of certain types of vehicles. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from the depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold during periods of economic slowdown or low retail demand could result in higher losses for us. Further, we are dependent on the efficient operation of the wholesale auction markets. If the operations of the wholesale auction markets are disrupted, as they were during the recent COVID 19 pandemic, we may be unable to sell our used vehicles at sufficient volume and/or pricing. The number of delinquencies, defaults, losses and repossessions on sub-prime automobile receivables has historically been significantly influenced by the employment status of obligors on automobile loan contracts. Any general weakness in the economy may affect sub-prime obligors more strongly than the population as a whole. Furthermore, the global financial markets have at times experienced increased volatility due to uncertainty surrounding the level and sustainability of the sovereign debt of various countries. Concerns regarding sovereign debt may spread to other countries at any time. There can be no assurance that this uncertainty relating to the sovereign debt of various countries will not lead to further disruption of the financial and credit markets in the United States, which could adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. A deterioration in economic conditions and certain economic factors, such as reduced business activity, high unemployment, interest rates, housing prices, energy prices (including the price of gasoline), increased consumer indebtedness (including of obligors on the receivables), lack of available credit, the rate of inflation (such as the recent increase in inflation) and consumer perceptions of the economy, as well as other factors, such as terrorist events, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, public health emergencies, extreme weather conditions or significant changes in the geopolitical environment (such as the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia) and/or public policy, including increased state, local or federal taxation, could adversely affect the ability and willingness of obligors to meet their payment obligations under the receivables we originate. Our operating results could be adversely affected if obligors are unable to make timely payments on their receivables or if we elect to, or are required to, implement forbearance programs in connection with obligors suffering a hardship (including hardships related to the COVID-19 pandemic and general economic conditions). The above described negative economic factors, as well as others, have also historically resulted in decreased consumer demand for motor vehicles, which may result in an increase in the inventory of used motor vehicles and depress the price at which repossessed motor vehicles may be sold or delay the timing of those sales. If the default rate on our receivables increases and the price at which the vehicles may be sold at auction declines, our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions may be adversely affected. If Interest Rates Rise, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our principal means of financing our portfolio of automobile contracts is to issue asset-backed notes in securitizations. The interest payable on such notes is our largest expense. Although such expense is fixed with respect to issued securitization trust debt, the terms of future securitizations may vary. The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates multiple times in 2022, once in early 2023, and is expected to continue to raise rates further in 2023. If interest rates on risk-free debt continue to increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, If interest rates in general should rise, our expenses would likewise rise, to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operation and our ability to enter into future financing transactions. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. For our receivables originated prior to January 2018, we maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated.. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Receivables originated since January 2018 are recorded at fair value and incorporate estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a fair value adjustment to those receivables or reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at their own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. A host of state and local governmental agencies have jurisdiction over material portions of our business, and might take action adverse to us. No assurance can be given as to whether any of such hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. Existing law, regulations and interpretations may change in ways that increase our costs of compliance. In addition to direct costs, such compliance requires changes in forms, processes, procedures, controls and in the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may adopt new investment policies or otherwise impose new expectations that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors, any or all of which may have negative effects on our business and/or reputation. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables executed after December 2016 have been and will be subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage, our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the FTC, the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the recorded value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous recorded value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Recorded Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our recorded value, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Have Adverse Effects The COVID-19 virus has spread (“the pandemic”) throughout the world. The pandemic has had adverse effects on the economy of the United States (notably a significant decrease in employment) and the global economy in general. The long-term effects of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the pandemic are unknown. The extent to which obligors on our automobile contracts may be adversely affected by the pandemic (including a resurgence due to variants of COVID-19), by loss of employment, and by related efforts of governments to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout the nation and world cannot be predicted. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the ability of obligors to make timely payments to us. Finally, and depending on the extent to which the pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to our business or operations, the ability or willingness of our customers to make timely payments, and risks of geographic concentrations. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Effect of Social, Economic and Other Factors on Losses. The ability of our customers to make payments on automobile contracts will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors, most notably the extent to which our customers remain gainfully employed. Other economic factors include interest rates, general unemployment levels, the rate of inflation, adjustments in monthly mortgage payments and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally and the effect of government stimulus programs and consumer protection/payment relief efforts implemented in connection with the COVID-19 virus. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, consumer attitudes toward bankruptcy and the repayment of indebtedness and consumer perceptions of political events and shifts, which may be affected by the pandemic. We are generally unable to determine whether or to what extent economic or social factors will affect the performance of our portfolio of automobile contracts, but caution that a recession or depression in local, regional or national economies would be expected to increase delinquencies and losses, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2022, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 6.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 31%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. See "" Dividend Policy "". Forward-Looking Statements Discussions of certain matters contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "" Securities Act "" ) and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, and as such, may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, expectations of the business environment in which we operate, projections of future performance, perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding our mission and vision. You can generally identify forward-looking statements as statements containing the words "" will, "" "" would, "" "" believe, "" "" may, "" "" could, "" "" expect, "" "" anticipate, "" "" intend, "" "" estimate, "" "" assume "" or other similar expressions. Our actual results, performance and achievements may differ materially from the results, performance and achievements expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. The discussion under "" Risk Factors "" identifies some of the factors that might cause such a difference, including the following: Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance.

See "" Where You Can Find More Information "" and "" Documents Incorporated by Reference. "" Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.8 million through 2023. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 69,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $2.5 million through 2024. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Oak Brook, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2023 to 2029. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.4 million. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. Massachusetts Civil Investigative Demand . In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the Company’s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating with the inquiry. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2022 is $4.9 million, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2022 does not exceed $11.2 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2022, we have originated a total of approximately $20.0 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2022 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Contract Purchases and Outstanding Managed Portfolio Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2022, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 95 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2022, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our recent history of term securitizations is summarized in the table below: Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations Amount of Receivables Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $400 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in July 2022, extending the revolving period to July 2024, with an optional amortization period through July 2025. In addition, the capacity was doubled from $100 million to $200 million at the July 2022 renewal. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2026. In June 2022, we doubled the capacity for this facility from $100 million to $200 million. We previously had a third facility. This $100 million facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in February 2021 and elected not to renew it. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. In a securitization, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Term Securitizations, (d) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (e) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 included a $15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic had not materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result, on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also, because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( "" spread account "" ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2022, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2022, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $11.2 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 95 term securitizations of approximately $17.7 billion in contracts. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently, we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020 and four securitizations in each of 2021 and 2022. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2022, our revenues were $329.7 million, an increase of $61.9 million, or 23.1%, from the prior year revenues of $267.8 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is the increase in interest income resulting from the increase in the average outstanding balance of finance receivables measured at fair value. In addition, mark ups to the finance receivables measured at fair value also contributed to the increase in revenues during the year. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 include a $15.3 million mark up to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The marks are estimates based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and increases or decreases in our estimates of future net losses. Results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 included the $15.3 million mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The mark-up was the result of lower than expected losses during the period as our previous estimates for higher losses due to the pandemic had not materialized. In the fourth quarter of 2022, our re-evaluation of the fair values of these receivables resulted in a positive mark for certain older receivables and a negative mark to the fair values of newer receivables that largely offset each other. As a result, on a net basis, no mark was taken in the fourth quarter of 2022. Revenues for the prior year period include a $4.4 million mark down to the fair value portfolio. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 include a $4.4 million mark down to the fair value portfolio. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $39.0 million, or 14.6%, to $305.2 million from $266.2 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the 32.5% increase in the average balance of finance receivables measured at fair value over the prior year period. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Other income was $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This 54.1% increase was primarily driven by the increase in origination and servicing fees we earned from third party receivables that we began originating in May 2021. These fees were $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $1.3 million in the prior year period. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $202.1 million for the prior year, an increase of $11.5 million, or 5.7%. The increase is primarily due to increases in interest expense, sales expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Reductions in provisions for credit losses offset some of the increase in operating expenses. Employee costs increased by $3.7 million or 4.7%, to $84.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, representing 39.5% of total operating expenses. Employee costs were $80.5 million in the prior year, or 39.9% of total operating expenses. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2022 and 2021: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $37.6 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 8.7%, compared to the previous year and represented 17.6% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $12.3 million to $87.5 million, or 16.3%, compared to $75.2 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 41.0% of total operating expenses in 2022. The primary reason for the increase in interest expense is the increase in interest expense on our warehouse lines of credit and securitization trust debt. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.2 million, or 9.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt increased 11.0% to $2,020.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have increased in 2022 after decreasing in 2021. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit was $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $4.4 million in the prior year. Lower rates were offset by higher utilization of our credit lines during the year compared to last year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $130.1 million during 2022 compared to $51.3 million in 2021. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $4.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $3.8 million in the prior year as the average balance has increased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes decreased by $297,000, or 11.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $25.3 million in the prior year to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Total Change Change Due to Rate The annualized yield on our finance receivables was 12.0% for 2022 compared to 12.4% in 2021. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these fair value receivables was $2,388.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,802.6 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $28.1 million compared to $14.6 million in 2021. The reserve decreases were primarily due to improved credit performance for these receivables. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers. Sales expense increased by $6.2 million to $23.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 and represented 10.8% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,854.4 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $1,146.3 million in the prior year period. Occupancy expenses decreased by $180,000 or 2.3%, to $7.5 million compared to $7.7 million in the previous year and represented 3.5% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $57,000 or 3.4%, to $1.6 million compared to $1.7 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded income tax expense of $30.2 million, representing a 26% effective tax rate. In the prior period, our income tax expense was $18.2 million, representing a 28% effective tax rate. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $267.8 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 1.2%, from the prior year revenues of $271.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $28.7 million, or 9.7%, to $266.3 million from $295.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our legacy portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an average of 20.2%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Interest Yield Interest Yield Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are net of mark downs of $4.4 million and $29.5 million, respectively, to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. Other income was $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $202.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $251.0 million for the prior year, a decrease of $49.0 million, or 19.5%. The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in interest expense and provisions for credit losses. Employee costs increased by $336,000 or 0.4%, to $80.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 39.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.2 million for the prior year, or 31.9% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for 2021 include approximately $8.0 million for the establishment of a bonus pool for a segment of employees we classify as Managers. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021 and 2020: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared to the previous year and represented 17.1% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $26.1 million to $75.2 million, or 25.8%, compared to $101.3 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 37.2% of total operating expenses in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense is the decrease in securitization trust debt interest. Interest on securitization trust debt decreased by $23.6 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 9.8% to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally decreased since 2019 and have stayed relatively low in 2021 despite trending upward throughout the year. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: Blended Cost of Funds on Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 4.4% for 2020. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $3.2 million, or 42.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $51.3 million during 2021 compared to $92.5 million in 2020. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million in the prior year as the average balance has increased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes increased by $466,000, or 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $19.3 million in the prior year to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 202 Compared to December 31, 2020 Total Change Change Due to Rate The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,802.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,631.5 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. In the prior year period, we recorded an increase to provision for credit losses for $14.1 million. That provision represented our estimate in 2020 of additional forecasted losses that might be incurred as a result of the pandemic on our portfolio of finance receivables. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded upon our adoption of CECL in January 2020. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense increased by $2.7 million to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,146.3 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $742.6 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Since then, our contract purchase volumes have gradually increased to pre-pandemic levels. Occupancy expenses increased by $294,000 or 4.0%, to $7.7 million compared to $7.4 million in the previous year and represented 3.8% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $109,000 or 6.1%, to $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operating expenses. Income tax expense was $18.2 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $680,000 and $8.8 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense for 2021 would have been $18.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 29%. For 2020, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 36%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $215.9 million, $198.2 million and $238.8 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $713.9 million and $115.4 million, respectively. This compares to net cash provided by investing activities of $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $1,673.2 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $1,107.5 million and $739.7 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Net cash provided by financing activities were $484.2 million in 2022. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $50.4 million and $328.5 million, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $1,411.0 million in new securitization trust debt in 2022 compared to $1,110.7 million in 2021 and $714.5 million in 2020. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,060.1 million, $1,153.1 million and $1,010.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had unrestricted cash of $13.5 million and $114.7 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $22.1 million of such eligible collateral. During 2022, we completed four securitizations aggregating $1,411.0 million of notes sold. In January 2023, we completed another securitization with $324.8 million of notes sold. Cash proceeds from this securitization were used to pay down the outstanding balance on our two warehouse credit facilities thus increasing the amounts available for borrowing under these facilities. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. Our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2,469.0 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $285.3 million of warehouse lines of credit, $49.6 million of residual interest financing debt and $25.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): We anticipate repaying debt due in 2023 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0% of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 4.75% per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to 8.50% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50% per annum. In July 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $150.3 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.00% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.15% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15% per annum. On February 2, 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $137.6 million outstanding under this facility. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The notes were paid off in February 2022. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50 million securitization of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2022 there was $50.0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 45 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $2,108.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2022 there were $25.3 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""estimates,"" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the ability of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts; and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have usually structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We may continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "" Exchange Act "" ) as of December 31, 2022 (the "" Evaluation Date "" ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report. Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Loans at Fair Value As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company carries all finance receivables acquired after 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company had $2.4 billion in finance receivables that are carried at fair value, all of which are classified as level 3 fair values as they contain one or more inputs which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. With assistance from an outside valuation expert, the Company used a level 3 fair value methodology for the fair value of finance receivables. The significant assumptions used by the Company to calculate the fair value of these financial receivables include the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivables. These significant assumptions were based on the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. We identified the valuation of finance receivables carried at fair value as a critical audit matter as this estimate requires subjective auditor judgment. Our principal considerations in making this determination are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by the Company in determining the assumptions to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these finance receivables, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of loans at fair value included addressing: Substantively testing management's process, including evaluating management’s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of loans at fair value included: Allowance for Finance Credit Losses – Qualitative Factors Related to the CECL Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a gross receivables portfolio of $92.3 million and a related allowance for finance credit losses (ACL) on loans of $21.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Management estimates the allowance using relevant information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on the calendar quarter of origination is used to estimate expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. This estimate is adjusted by certain qualitative factors that may impact future credit losses. The qualitative factors represent management’s estimate of the impact of future losses. The use of qualitative factors to adjust historical losses for management’s forecast requires significant judgment. Management applies qualitative factors to adjust its estimation of the timing and amount losses to represent its future economic forecast. We identified auditing the reasonableness of qualitative factors used to create forecasts in its credit loss model as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. Testing the design and operating effectiveness of controls over the application of the assumptions used to support the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included addressing: Substantively testing management's process, including evaluating management’s judgments and assumptions, for developing the estimate of the allowance for credit losses included: /s/ Crowe LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (""CPS"") was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company"") specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts (""Contracts"") originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers (""Dealers"") located throughout the United States. Customers located in California, Texas, Ohio, Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Indiana represented 8.2 %, 7.8 %, 7.6 %, 5.7 %, 5.1 %, 4.6 %, and 4.6 % respectively, of contracts purchased during 2022 compared with 10.9 %, 6.1 %, 9.3 %, 3.6 %, 5.0 %, 4.6 %, and 5.0 % respectively in 2021. No other state had a concentration in excess of 4.6% in 2022. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80% owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2022, our unrestricted cash balance was $ 13.5 million , which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. For the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 include a $ 15.3 million positive mark to the carrying value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. The Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $ 4.4 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for current expected credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the recorded value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $ 571,000 and $ 2.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. T reatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "" overcollateralization "" of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: Earnings Per Share Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the related period. The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Incremental shares of 1.2 million , 5.7 million and 13.6 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation , that generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of stock options, restricted stock or other equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is recognized for awards issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. This cost is recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These are material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. Financial Covenant s Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2022, which represents our estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 149.3 million and $ 146.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $ 56.8 million and $ 49.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key terms such as interest rate, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: Finance receivables totaling $ 2.0 million and $ 2.7 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. Allowance for Credit Losses – Finance Receivables The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. We measure the weighted average monthly incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant historical period, we consider each pool’s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the results of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool’s most recent actual cumulative net loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on older vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history, job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly, for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics between various segments of our portfolio. Our methodology incorporates historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore, the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape, the Company’s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. In consideration of the depth and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently, we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those factors into our estimates. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of our finance receivables by annual vintage as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS At the adoption of CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $ 127.0 million . In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. The Company recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $ 28.1 million and $ 14.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance, an improved macroeconomic outlook and higher used car prices. The Company made additional provisions for credit losses of $ 14.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. Those reserve increases were made in consideration for the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $ 1,618,000 , $ 1,675,000 , and $ 1,784,000 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (5) Securitization Trust Debt We have completed numerous term securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these transactions is shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Securitization trust debt,” and the components of such debt are summarized in the following table: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS _________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 14.2 million and $ 12.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2022. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2022, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $ 149.3 million . Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are summarized below: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 2.6 million and $ 400,000 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 86.0% of eligible finance receivables. The Class A loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to one-month SOFR plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 4.75% per annum. The Class B loans under the facility generally accrue interest during the revolving period at a per annum rate equal to 8.50% per annum and during the amortization period at a per annum rate equal to 9.50% per annum. In July 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Citibank, N.A., and doubled the capacity from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to July 2024 and to include an amortization period through July 2025 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 150.3 million outstanding under this facility. On February 2, 2022, we renewed our two-year revolving credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.00% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.15% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.15% per annum. In June 2022, we increased the capacity of our credit agreement with Ares Agent Services, L.P. from $100 million to $200 million. This facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 137.6 million outstanding under this facility. The total outstanding debt on our two warehouse lines of credit was $ 287.9 million as of December 31, 2022, compared to $ 106.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $ 50 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $ 50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2022 there was $ 50.0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 377,000 and $ 629,000 as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of our outstanding subordinated renewable notes as of December 31, 2022: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2022, we purchased 4,139,664 shares of our common stock at an average price of $ 11.11 . In January, March, and July 2022 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 35.0 million of our common stock. There is approximately $ 8.3 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015, July 2018 and again in November 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000, 19,200,000 and 22,200,000 , respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 5.42 , $ 2.65 , and $ 1.33 , respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 75 % to 80 % for 2022, 79 % to 71 % for 2021, and 72 % to 80 % for 2020. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $ 4.4 million , $ 2.0 million and $ 1.9 million , respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $ 9.5 million . This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.5 years. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $ 11.2 million and $ 13.1 million , respectively. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $ 7.8 million and $ 9.7 million , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 23.4 million and $ 9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2022 and cash of $ 15.3 million was received. At December 31, 2022, there were a total of 2,661,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 for stock options under the 2006 and 1997 plans is as follows: The following table presents the price distribution of stock options outstanding and exercisable for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: We did not issue any stock options with an exercise price above or below the market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 10.2 million as of December 31, 2022 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $10.2 million consists of approximately $ 7.0 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $ 3.2 million of net state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $ 42.4 million . These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2023. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2022, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. (10) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, equipment, software and hardware. The Company has entered into operating leases for the majority of its real estate locations, primarily office space. These leases are generally for periods of three to seven years with various renewal options. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine if a contract contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the leases expense included in Occupancy, General and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: The following table presents the supplemental cash flow information related to leases: Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. In April 2022, a motion for certification of a class was filed but has not been ruled upon. It is reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. Massachusetts Civil Investigative Demand . In September 2021, we received a civil investigative demand from the Office of the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relating to the Company’s communications with and repossession notices sent to Massachusetts customers. We are cooperating with the inquiry. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2022, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2022 is $ 4.9 million , and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2022 does not exceed $ 11.2 million . Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (11) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $ 2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $ 1.3 million , $ 1.3 million , and $ 1.4 million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2022 and 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25 % per annum as of December 31, 2022. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The estimated net gain that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2023 is $ 169,000 . The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. Cash Flows CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021, by asset category, is as follows: ________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (12) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2022, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $ 1.9 million . We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $ 1.3 million , which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 30 %, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $ 571,000 . The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2021 was $ 2.5 million after applying a valuation adjustment of $ 1.9 million . There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2022 and 2021. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13) Subsequent Events On January 25, 2023 we executed our first securitization of 2023. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $324.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by $362.9 million in automobile receivables originated by CPS. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2023-A, consist of five classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Standard & Poor’s and DBRS Morningstar, and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and CPS’s experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 6.82%. The 2023-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance and overcollateralization of 10.50%. The transaction agreements require accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 14.00% of the original receivable pool balance, or 38.00% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. ",0000889609,CPSS

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee directors Daniel Wood (chairman), Chris Adams, William Grounds, and William Roberts. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this report. Based on such review and discussions and relying thereon, we have recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Daniel S. Wood(chairman) Chris A. Adams William W. Grounds William B. Roberts Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2021 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Outcome The Compensation Committee annually considers the results of the most recent advisory vote by shareholders to approve executive officer compensation. In the 2021 advisory vote, a majority of the voted shares (62.6%) approved of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee has noted the substantial negative vote, but has determined to retain the existing design, purposes and structure of our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive officer compensation in its future administration of executive compensation. Compensation Objectives The Company's objectives with respect to compensation are several. The significant objectives are to cause compensation (i) to be sufficient in total amount to provide reasonable assurance of retaining key executives, (ii) to include a significant contingent component, so as to provide strong incentives to meet designated Company objectives, and (iii) to include a significant component tied to the price of the Common Stock, so as to align management's incentives with shareholder interests. The compensation committee (""Committee"") of the Company's Board of Directors is charged with administering the Company’s compensation plans to meet those objectives. To the extent that elements of compensation would not advance such objectives, or would do so less effectively than would other elements, the Committee seeks to avoid paying compensation in those forms. Role of the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer Our Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, to make all decisions regarding executive compensation, including administration of our compensation plans. In that regard, the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is authorized to form subcommittee(s) and to retain experts and consultants to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. To date it has not done so. The chief executive officer, who attends meetings of the Compensation Committee by invitation of the Committee’s chairman, assists the Committee in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by, among other things: The other executive officers do not have a role in determining their own compensation, other than to discuss their annual individual performance objectives and results achieved with the chief executive officer. Our Overall Approach The Committee has put into place a compensation system consisting of three key components: base salary, an annual cash bonus pursuant to an incentive plan, and long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options. The table below provides comparative information regarding the components of our year 2021 executive compensation program. We are applying the same elements in our executive compensation program for the year 2022. · Attract and retain high quality personnel · Targeted to be superior to compensation offered by our competitors · Achieve objectives set annually · Annual bonus amount is set and computed as a percentage of base salary · Actual payout determined by Company and individual performance · Target total cash (base salary + target bonus) designed to be superior to compensation offered by our competitors · Align interests of executives with those of shareholders; · Target long-term incentive award size designed to retain executives through long-term vesting and the potential for wealth accumulation, contingent on benefit to the shareholders The Committee has from time to time considered providing additional elements of executive compensation. It has considered elements such as restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, compensation contingent on a change in control, defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation, and supplemental retirement plans (supplemental in the sense that they exceed the limits for tax advantaged treatment). To date, the Committee has elected not to pay compensation in such forms, having determined that the Company's objectives are better met by one or more of the elements of compensation that it does pay. Regarding restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Committee has noted that any form of equity equivalent to or closely tied to common stock does serve to meet the objective of aligning officers' personal interest with that of the shareholders generally. The Committee believes, however, that the objective is better met by grants of stock options than by grants of share equivalents, because recipients of the grants will face the same degree of variance in results at a lesser cost to the Company, when option grants are compared to grants of restricted stock units. Further, unlike restricted stock, option grants will not provide a reward to the holder absent an improvement over time in the Company’s stock price. The committee has elected not to provide material perquisites as compensation, having determined that cash is a better medium of exchange. Regarding compensation that would be payable contingent on a change in control of the Company, the Committee believes that there are certain legitimate objectives to be met by such contingent compensation. As of the date of this report, however, no such contingent compensation plans are in place. Regarding defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation and supplemental retirement plans, the Committee believes that the Company's retention objective is better met by straight cash payments, whether in the form of base salary or in the form of bonus compensation. In particular with respect to plans for deferred compensation, the Committee believes those make sense for the Company and for the recipient only on the basis of assumptions regarding future tax rates payable by each. Having no assurance that such assumptions would be correct, the Committee has chosen not to put into place any special deferred compensation programs for the company’s executive officers. Those officers do participate in a company-sponsored tax-deferred savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, on the same terms available to company employees generally. The Committee may in the future revisit its conclusions as to any of the components discussed above, or may consider other forms of compensation. The Base Salary Element With respect to the retention objective, the Committee considers an executive's base salary to be the most critical component. Acting primarily on the basis of recommendations of the chief executive officer, the Committee adjusts other officers' base salaries annually, with the adjustment generally consisting of a 2% to 10% increase from the prior year's rate. Where exceptional circumstances apply, such as recruitment of a new executive officer, a promotion to executive officer status or a special need to retain an individual officer, the chief executive officer may recommend, and the Committee may approve, a larger increase. The Company's general approach in setting the annual compensation of its named executive officers is to set those officers’ base compensation by reference to their base rates for the preceding year. During the year ended December 2021, the Company's chief executive officer, Charles E. Bradley, Jr., received $995,000 in base salary. In setting that rate in the first quarter of 2021, the Committee considered the base salary rate that the Company had paid in the prior year ($995,000), the desirability of providing an annual increase, the desirability of ensuring retention of the services of the Company's incumbent chief executive officer, the Company’s financial performance, and the levels of chief executive officer compensation prevailing among other financial services companies. The Committee considered whether to adjust officers’ base compensation for 2021, and determined not to increase the base rate for the chief executive officer or the other named executive officers. The Annual Incentive Bonus (EMB) element To encourage executive officers and key management personnel to exercise their best efforts and management skills toward causing the Company to meet its overall objective, and toward achieving designated specific individual objectives, the Company has implemented an Executive Management Bonus Plan, with annual payouts. Under the Company's bonus plan as applied to the year ended December 2021, the Company’s two executive vice presidents (each of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 140% of their base salaries, and the Company’s senior vice presidents (two of whom are among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 110% of their base salaries. The chief executive officer was eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 500% of his base salary. The implementation of this element for the year 2021 is discussed below. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Element The Committee also awards incentive and non-qualified stock options under the Company's stock option plans. Such awards are designed to assist in the retention of key executives and management personnel and to create an incentive to create shareholder value over a sustained period of time. The Company believes that stock options are a valuable tool in compensating and retaining employees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Committee granted stock options to the Company's executive officers. All such grants were awarded on August 3, 2021, and all carry exercise prices equal to the market price for the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The terms of such options are described below, under the caption ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year."" The numbers of shares made subject to each of the option grants were based on various factors relating to the responsibilities of the individual officers and to the extent of previous grants to such individuals. Because the exercise price of all options granted is equal to or above the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, the option holders may realize value only if the stock price appreciates from the price on the date the options were granted. This design is intended to focus executives on the enhancement of shareholder value over the long term. Other Elements The Company also maintains certain broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical and dental insurance, and a qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k) plan), in which executive officers are permitted to participate. Such officers participate on the same terms as non-executive personnel who meet applicable eligibility criteria, and are subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the benefits that may be payable under the plans. The Company does not maintain any form of defined benefit pension or retirement plan in which executive officers may participate, nor does it maintain any form of supplemental retirement savings or supplemental deferred compensation plan. Exercise of Discretion In exercising its discretion as to the level of executive compensation and its components, the Committee considers a number of factors. Members of the Committee conduct informal surveys of compensation paid to comparable executives within and without the consumer finance industry. The Committee finds these data useful primarily in evaluating the overall level of compensation paid or to be paid to the Company's executive officers. The Committee noted that the Company met and exceeded its budget objectives for the year. Operational factors considered included individual and group management goals; indicators of the performance and credit quality of the Company's servicing portfolio, including levels of delinquencies and charge-offs; and indicators of successful management of personnel, including employee stability. All of such factors are assessed with reference to the judgment of the Committee as to the degree of difficulty of achieving desired outcomes. With respect to payment of annual bonuses and grants of stock options, the Committee also takes note of factors relating to the degree of the Company's success over the most recent year. Specific Objectives and Evaluation In the first quarter of 2021 the compensation committee designated specific objectives with respect to the chief executive officer to be accomplished within the year 2021, and fixed weights to be associated with each such objective. The chief executive officer proposed to the committee specific annual objectives with respect to each other executive officer of the company, which the committee, after making certain modifications, approved. These objectives and the Committee’s administration of the annual incentive bonus element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “ - Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year - Executive Management Bonus Plan.” Grants of Options The Committee's award of stock options to the Company's officers in August 2021 included option grants to the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. In determining the appropriate level of such grant, the Committee considered the long-term performance of the chief executive officer and the desirability of providing significant incentive for future performance, as well as the desirability of ensuring that officer's continued retention by the Company, and the various factors noted above with respect to option grants generally. These grants and the Committee’s administration of the long-term incentive element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “-Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year – Equity Incentives.” Stock Ownership, Hedging and Pledging . Our board of directors and compensation committee have considered whether to establish a minimum stock ownership goal for members of our senior management. We have elected not to do so, considering that such a policy would either be strict and mandatory, in which case it would undermine the compensatory objectives of our equity compensation plans, or would be merely hortatory, in which case it could be expected to have little effect. We’ve also noted that the multiyear vesting terms of the equity incentives granted under our plans have the effect of aligning our executives’ individual personal financial incentives with the future price performance of the Company’s stock. As part of our comprehensive compliance policy, we remind all company executive officers of the mandatory legal prohibition on selling short company shares. We also prohibit company executive officers from entering into transactions that would have the effect of causing those individuals to benefit from a decline in the price of the company stock, such as the purchase of “put” options. We prohibit such “hedging” transactions but we do not find it appropriate to prohibit our executive officers from pledging their shares of company stock as security for a loan. We believe that the beneficial incentives of owning company stock remain substantially the same with or without such a pledge. Summary of Compensation The following table summarizes all compensation earned during the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 by the Company's chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and the other three most highly compensated individuals (such five individuals, the ""named executive officers"") who were serving in such position or as executive officers at any time in 2021. It lists their names, the principal positions in which they served in those years, and each component of compensation paid with respect to those years. Summary Compensation Table Year Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation Option Awards (1) All Other Compen- sation (2) Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year Equity Incentives In the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not grant any stock awards or stock appreciation rights to any of our named executive officers. We granted options to substantially all of our management level employees on August 3, 2021. The option grants noted in the tables above and below were awarded to the named executive officers as part of those grants. We also granted awards under our Executive Management Bonus Plan, which were evaluated and paid out after the end of the year. The amounts paid are shown in the table above (Summary Compensation Table) as “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” In the August 2021 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($4.95 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. Each of the other executive officers of the Company received a grant at that time on the same terms. Mr. Fritz and Mr. Lavin received such grants with respect to 90,000 shares each, and Ms. Robinson and Ms. Straten each received such a grant with respect to 60,000 shares. The table below provides information regarding the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2021. Grants of Plan-Based Awards The “target” and “maximum” figures appearing in the table above represent the maximum cash payout under the individual executives’ Executive Management Bonus Plan awards as of the date the incentive was fixed. The actual payout to each individual named in the table above has been determined and paid prior to the date of this report. That amount was in each case materially less than the maximum (approximately 58% of the maximum, in the case of the chief executive). The respective actual payments are described below, and appear above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading “Non-Equity Plan Compensation.” Because each non-equity incentive plan award has been settled and paid, the future payout under such awards as of the date of this report is in each case zero. The “grant date fair value” figures appearing in the table above, which are the computed fair values of stock option awards, are computed as described in note 1 to the Summary Compensation Table. Executive Management Bonus Plan The Executive Management Bonus Plan award granted to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley, called for him to meet as many as possible of six separate operational and financial objectives within the year 2021. The Compensation Committee assigned to each of those objectives a value as a percentage of base salary. The objectives and their weightings were as follows: to meet or exceed the Company’s quarterly budgeted earnings (25% each quarter, total of 100%), to raise up to $60 million of debt capital (60%), to renew or replace one of the specific warehouse credit facilities (50%), to execute three rated securitization transactions (30% each, 90% total), to increase the Company’s annual originations of receivables to each of four targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 25% for reaching aggregate amounts of $800 million, $850 million, $900 million, and $950 million), and to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in excess of each of four targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 25% for reaching prices of $4.50, $5.00, $5.50, and $6.00 per share). The total of the seven weightings is 500%; accordingly, the target and maximum possible value to that officer of the award was 500% of his base salary for 2021. In a series of meetings, the committee evaluated the chief executive’s performance in comparison to the goals. The Compensation Committee determined that the budget objective was met in all four quarters of 2021, and credited the chief executive with the maximum value, or 100%. The Company was successful in raising new debt capital in June 2021, in the amount of $50 million. The Committee credited the chief executive with the full 60% designated for that objective. The Committee also determined that the renewal of the warehouse line was not completed in 2021 and found no credit was earned in that respect. The Committee noted that the Company had executed four rated securitizations during the year, three of them after the objective was fixed, representing the full creditable performance of 90%. It determined that our originations volume exceeded $1.1 billion for the year while maintaining credit quality, representing creditable performance in the full amount of 100%. The Committee noted that the stock price objective was exceeded with respect to all targets and credited the chief executive with the maximum value of 100%. The aggregate valuation of all creditable performance for the chief executive officer was thus 450%, which would imply a bonus payment under our Executive Management Bonus Plan of $4,478,000. The committee elected to pay a bonus less than the maximum creditable percentage, in the amount of $2,900,000, representing 291% of our chief executive’s base salary. The Executive Management Bonus Plan awards granted to the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer are evaluated on a more subjective basis, and were set by the Compensation Committee in consultation with and on the recommendation of the chief executive officer. Factors used in determining the amount of bonus for the two named executive officers who are executive vice presidents of the Company are these: (I) an evaluation of the executive’s skills and performance, 30%, (II) whether the executive has met two individual objectives approved by the compensation committee, 18% in aggregate, (III) whether the Company as a whole has met or exceeded budget targets, 12%, (IV) a subjective evaluation of that executive’s departments, 30%, and (V) a discretionary allocation recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee, 50%. Numerical scores are assigned to each of these factors, up to the maximum percentages stated above, and can result in a maximum bonus of 140% of base compensation. Similar factors are applied in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are senior vice presidents of the Company: (I) skills and performance, 30%, (II) two individual objectives, 18%, (III) Company budget, 12%, (IV) subjective evaluation of that executive’s department, 20%, and (V) discretionary allocation, 30%, resulting in a maximum bonus of 110% of base compensation. Following the end of the year 2021, our compensation committee evaluated each named executive officer’s performance in relation to these standards and goals. The Company met its overall budget target in each quarter, and each officer accordingly received full credit with respect to that target. With respect to the individual factors, the compensation committee, acting in part on the advice of our chief executive officer, determined that creditable performance for 2021 for each named executive officer other than the chief executive officer was as set forth below: On that basis, the Compensation Committee approved payments to these named executive officers in the amounts shown in the rightmost column. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2021 the number of unexercised options held by each of the named executive officers, the number of shares subject to then exercisable and unexercisable options held by such persons and the exercise price and expiration date of each such option. Each option referred to in the table was granted at an option price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the date of grant. None of such individuals holds a stock award; accordingly, only information concerning option awards is presented. (1) Becomes exercisable as to the unexercisable portion on May 9, 2022. (2) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-half of the unexercisable portion on August 8, 2022 and 2023. (3) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-third of the unexercisable portion on June 1, 2022, 2023 and 2024 (4) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of 25% of the unexercisable portion on August 3, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025. Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year All of the five named executive officers exercised stock options during 2021. The table below shows the realized value and the number of options exercised for those three individuals. None of our officers hold stock awards; accordingly, no stock awards vested during 2021. Option Exercises and Stock Vested (1) The value realized is the difference between the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise (the closing price reported by Nasdaq) and the exercise price of the option. Executive Management Bonus Plan (Non-equity Incentive Plan) The salary and cash bonus of the named executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation appearing in the Summary Compensation Table above under the caption ""Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"" is paid pursuant to an executive management bonus plan (the “EMB Plan”). The EMB Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee selects participants in the EMB Plan from among the Company’s executive officers and determines the performance goals, target amounts and other terms and conditions of awards under the EMB Plan. With respect to officers other than the chief executive officer, determinations of base salary and of criteria relating to the EMB Plan are based in part on evaluations of such officers prepared by the chief executive officer, which are furnished to and discussed with the Compensation Committee. Director Compensation Throughout 2021, we paid our non-employee directors a retainer of $5,167 per month, with an additional fee of $500 per month for service on a board committee ($1,000 for a committee chairman). Non-employee directors also received per diem fees of $1,000 for attendance in person at meetings of the board of directors, or $500 for attendance by telephone. No per diem fees are paid for attendance at committee meetings. The Board in 2021 approved issuance to each non-employee director of options to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares. The exercise prices of all such options are the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which was $2.61 per share. The following table summarizes compensation received by our directors for the year 2021: Fees Earned or Paid in Cash (1) (1) This column reports cash compensation earned in 2021 for Board and committee service. (2) This column represents the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 2021 fiscal year for the fair value of stock options granted to the directors in 2021. The fair value was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS 123R. The fair value per option was $2.61, based on assumptions of 3.24 years expected life, expected volatility of 79.20%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and a risk-free rate of 0.37%. In addition to the stock option awards granted in 2021, our directors held at December 31, 2021 option awards granted in previous years. The total options held at December 31, 2021 represent the right to purchase shares as follows: Mr. Bradley, 2,840,000 shares; Mr. Adams, 330,000 shares; Mr. Grasso, 60,000 shares; Mr. Rayhill, 410,000 shares; Mr. Roberts, 60,000 shares; Mr. Washer, 330,000 shares; and Mr. Wood, 345,000 shares. (3) Mr. Bradley's compensation as chief executive officer of the Company is described elsewhere in this report. He received no additional compensation for service on the Company's Board of Directors. (4) Mr. Grounds was elected a director at the shareholder meeting held December 1, 2021 and thus did not receive any option awards issued earlier in 2021. Pension Plans The Company's officers do not participate in any pension or retirement plan, other than a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (commonly known as a 401(k) plan). Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control This section provides information regarding payments and benefits to the named executive officers that would be triggered by termination of the officer’s employment (including resignation, or voluntary termination; severance, or involuntary termination; and retirement) or a change of control of the Company. Each of the named executive officers is an at-will employee and, as such, does not have an employment contract. In addition, if the officer’s employment terminates for any reason other than a change of control of the Company, any unvested stock options are terminated, and vested options become subject to accelerated expiration: ordinarily three months following separation from service, or twelve months in the case of disability, retirement or death. Accordingly, there are no payments or benefits that are triggered by any termination event (including resignation and severance) other than in connection with a change of control of the Company. Benefits Triggered by Change of Control or Termination after Change of Control Our stock option plans provide that each employee of ours who holds outstanding unexpired options under our stock option may have the right to exercise such options following a change of control of the Company, without regard to the date such option would first be exercisable. Each of the named executive officers holds such options. The “acceleration” of options is mandatory following certain changes of control, and subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee following certain others. Acceleration is mandatory in the event of (i) the sale, or other disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (ii) a merger or similar transaction in which shareholders of the Company hold less than 50% of the shares of the surviving entity; provided, however, that acceleration following a merger or similar transaction is mandatory only if the holder suffers a Qualifying Termination (defined below) within one year following the transaction, or if the surviving entity does not provide the holder with an equivalent award. Acceleration is also mandatory if a holder suffers a Qualifying Termination within one year following (iii) a change within a three-year period in the membership of a majority of the board of directors (excluding changes recommended by the board), or (iv) a person’s acquisition of outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than directly from the Company and without approval of the board, resulting in that person’s having beneficial ownership of greater than 25% of the Company. Under our stock option plans, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to provide for acceleration under other circumstances than those described above with respect to any particular stock option or class of stock options. The committee would expect to exercise its discretion with the intention of preserving the value of the stock option award. To date, such discretion has not been exercised. A “Qualifying Termination” is a termination of the holder’s employment by the Company other than for cause, disability or death, or by the holder for “good reason” (principally relating to a material diminution in the holder’s authority, compensation or responsibilities, or a relocation of greater than 50 miles). The preceding description applies to options held by officers and employees. Options issued to non-employee directors accelerate without the exercise of discretion upon any of the four categories of change of control described above. As of December 31, 2021, each of the named executive officers would realize a benefit if unvested stock options were to become immediately exercisable upon a change in control, based on the value of the shares underlying such options at the closing market price on December 31, 2021, which was $11.85 per share. The respective amounts of such possible benefit are set forth in the following table: Management Structure The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company. Its oversight is aimed at seeing to it that the company’s business is managed to meet our goals, and that the interests of the shareholders are served. Charles E. Bradley currently serves as both the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer, and is the only member of our board who is not independent of the Company. Largely because of the small number of directors (eight members in total), our board has chosen not to designate any individual formally as the lead independent director. Each director retains his full oversight responsibility. Our board structure supports the independence of our non-management directors. Our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee are each composed solely of independent directors. Our bylaws provide that any two directors have the authority to call meetings of the board of directors, as do specified officers, including the president and the secretary. To enhance the possible use of that authority by independent directors, the corporate secretary is under standing instructions to call a meeting at the instance of any one director. The board believes that combining the chairman and chief executive officer positions is currently the most effective leadership structure given Mr. Bradley’s in-depth knowledge of our business and industry and his demonstrated ability to formulate and implement strategic initiatives. Mr. Bradley is continuously involved in developing and implementing our strategies, working closely with the company’s other senior executives to seek continued disciplined growth and excellence in operations. His close involvement in management places Mr. Bradley in the best position to decide which business issues require consideration by the independent directors of the board. In addition, having a combined chairman and chief executive officer enables us to speak with a unified voice to shareholders, customers and others concerned with our company. The board believes that combining the chief executive and chairman roles, as part of a governance structure that includes oversight of management responsibilities by independent directors, provides the preferred system for meeting the requirement that the Company be managed in the best interest of our shareholders. Risk Oversight The board’s overall responsibility for directing the management of the Company includes risk oversight. The risk oversight function is performed at the board level, and by the Audit and Compensation Committees. The board of directors as a whole in its regular meetings discusses and considers the risk inherent in the existing business of the Company and in proposed initiatives. Because the Company’s business consists of extending consumer credit to individuals believed to be of higher risk than others (sub-prime credit), the assessment of the risk assumed in such extensions of credit is a primary consideration on the part of the board. Risk oversight is also a key function of the Audit and Compensation Committees. The principal risk management function performed by the Audit Committee is the ongoing assessment of the credit estimates and allowances periodically recorded in the Company’s books. The committee reviews that assessment regularly. Other risk assessments performed by the Audit Committee include assessments of contingent liabilities, and of other reserves and allowances. The principal risk management functions performed by the Compensation Committee are its setting and evaluation of objectives for the chief executive officer, in connection with its administration of the executive management bonus plan. The committee recognizes that the company’s business of extending subprime credit inherently includes a conflict between growing the business and managing the risk of credit losses: one means to increase the company’s business is to offer credit on terms that are priced too low for the risk assumed. The Compensation Committee manages that risk by insisting that objectives to grow the business are qualified by a mandate that credit quality be maintained at appropriate levels. To some extent, such risk management is shared with the Audit Committee, which performs the primary oversight of whether credit risk assumed is reflected with adequate allowances in the Company’s financial statements. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents inform a tion regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2021. CEO Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a mandate that public companies disclose the ratio of the compensation of their CEO to their median employee. Our CEO-median employee pay ratio calculation for 2021 is 86:1. We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2021 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2021 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. There have been no changes to our employee population or compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio. Accordingly, we have computed the ratio by reference to the same employee who we identified as our median employee for the year 2020, who was determined using the compensation of employees who were actively employed on December 31, 2020. We then computed the ratio by reference to that employee’s total compensation for the year 2021, which was $54,760. The total compensation of the CEO Charles Bradley in 2021 was $4,690,660. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Citigroup. On July 10, 2008, CPS and its wholly owned subsidiary Folio Funding II, LLC, as borrower, agreed with Citigroup Financial Products Inc. (“CGFP”), an affiliate of Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), to amend and restate the agreements governing a pre-existing revolving residual credit facility. CGFP was the note purchaser in and administrative agent of that credit facility. The amendments included the issuance to an affiliate of CGFP of a ten-year warrant to purchase (for nominal consideration) 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock, which warrant was subsequently transferred to CGFP. Upon issuance of such warrant, CGFP became a person with beneficial ownership of greater than 5% of the Company’s common stock. On March 10, 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing 500,000 of the 2,500,000 shares available for purchase upon exercise of such warrant. On July 10, 2018, CGFP exercised the remaining warrant, receiving 1,999,995 shares after surrender of shares equal in value to the nominal exercise price. On October 20, 2021, the Company purchased 1,999,995 shares of its stock from CGFP for a purchase price of $12.5 million, the prevailing market price at the time of the sale. The shares purchased, which represent approximately 8.7% of the common shares outstanding prior to the transaction have been cancelled and retired. In September 2011, and approximately quarterly thereafter, CGMI acted as a placement agent of asset-backed notes issued by securitization trusts sponsored by CPS. The issuances of investment-grade and below investment-grade notes, and the placement compensation to CGMI, from January 1, 2020 to the present, are set forth in the table below. In each case, one or more other placement agents also received compensation for placing such notes, as well as CGMI. On May 11, 2012, the Company entered into a one-year revolving credit agreement (the ""Citi Warehouse Agreement"") and related agreements with affiliates of Citigroup and others, under which the lenders have agreed to lend up to a maximum of $100 million, to be secured by automobile receivables. In connection with the Citi Warehouse Agreement, the Company paid a closing fee of $1,000,000. The Company first incurred indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement in the amount of $9.1 million on May 14, 2012. The Company used the proceeds of that draw for working capital. Following earlier extensions in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Company and the lenders agreed on December 18, 2020 to extend the revolving term of the Citi Warehouse Agreement to December 18, 2022. At the conclusion of the revolving period, at the election of either the borrower or the lender, the loans are to amortize for an additional one year, and then become due in full. Loans under the Citi Warehouse Agreement bear interest during the revolving period at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.00%, but in all events no less than 3.75% per year, and during the amortization period (if any) at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.00%, but in all events no less than 4.75% per year. The loans are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default. In connection with the 2020 renewal of the Citi Warehouse Agreement, we paid closing fees of $1,000,000, representing a fee calculated as the product of 0.5% and the fractional number of years by which the revolving period was extended. The maximum principal amount of indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement during 2021 was $100 million. During 2021, the Company paid $365.9 million of principal and $1.4 million of interest on such debt. As of April 26, 2022, the principal amount owed was $4.64 million. The Company intends to incur additional indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement from time to time as it purchases motor vehicle receivables from dealers. CPS Leasing. The Company holds 80% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of CPS Leasing, Inc. (""CPSL""). The remaining 20% of CPSL is held by Charles E. Bradley, Jr., who is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company. CPSL engaged in the equipment leasing business, and is currently in the process of liquidation as its leases come to term. The Company financed the operations of CPSL by making operating advances and by advancing to CPSL the fraction of the purchase prices of its leased equipment that CPSL did not borrow under its lines of credit. The aggregate amounts of the advances made by the Company and outstanding to CPSL as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were approximately $90,000, and $60,000, respectively. Policy on Related Party Transactions and Director Independence. The agreements and transactions described above, other than those described under the caption “Citigroup,” were entered into by the Company with parties who personally benefited from such transactions and who had a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company. It is the Company's policy that any such transactions with persons having a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company may take place only if approved by the Audit Committee or by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are disinterested with respect to the transaction, and independent in accordance with the standards for director independence prescribed by Nasdaq. Such policy is maintained in writing in the charter of the Audit Committee. The agreements and transactions above were reviewed and approved by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who were disinterested with respect to the transaction. The eight directors of the Company are Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Chris A. Adams, Louis M. Grasso, William W. Grounds, Brian J. Rayhill, William B. Roberts, Gregory S. Washer, and Daniel S. Wood, of whom Messrs. Rayhill, Grasso, Washer, and Wood compose the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that other than Mr. Bradley (who is the Company's chief executive officer), each of the other seven directors is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Fees Paid to Auditors The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to the Company’s independent registered public accounting firms for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Crowe has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since February 2009, and has reported on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2021. (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Audit-related fees comprise fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements. (3) The 2020 and 2021 tax fees represent services rendered in connection with preparation of state and federal tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Audit Committee Supervision of Principal Accountant The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and permitted non-audit fees to be paid to the independent auditor, and authorizes on behalf of the Company the payment of such fees, or refuses such authorization. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman and its vice-chairman the authority to approve performance of services on an interim basis. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, all services for which audit fees or audit related fees were paid were preapproved by the Audit Committee as a whole, or pursuant to such delegated authority. In the course of its meetings, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit fees outlined above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the audit firm, and has concluded that such independence is not and was not impaired.

TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I PART II PART III PART IV PART I Item 1. Business Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have purchased a total of approximately $18.1 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2021 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois branches. Most of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They may work from our Irvine branch, our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2021, we had 72 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications from 7,285 dealers in 47 states. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2021 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 3.1% of our total acquisitions and represented 2.6% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2021. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2021 approximately 82% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 18% consisted of financing for new cars. We generally solicit applications with the intent of originating contracts to hold as investments in our own portfolio. However, in May 2021 we began purchasing some contracts for immediate sale to a third-party to whom we refer applications that do not meet our lending criteria. We service all such contracts on behalf of the third-party. For contracts we originate for our own portfolio, we generally finance them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 91 term securitizations of approximately $16.2 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2021, we had two such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $100 million. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2021, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency, and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we received 1.7 million applications. Approximately 64% of all applications came through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 35% via another aggregator, Route One and 1% via our website. A portion of the DealerTrack and Route One volume are applications from our pass-through arrangements with other lenders who send us applications from their dealers in cases where those lenders choose not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2021, such pass-through applications represented 13% of our total applications. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history and an alternative data credit score provided by a major credit reporting bureau. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the applicant and structure of the automobile financing contract meets our criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. For applications that do not meet our criteria, we may forward them to one or more business partners who also invest in subprime automobile contracts. In the case of one third-party partner, as described above, we may purchase contracts they approve, followed by immediate resale to them, after which we retain the servicing. If this third-party declines the application, we advise the dealer that we will not purchase the contract. Other partners to whom we refer applications may or may not choose to purchase such contracts by working directly with the dealers who submitted the applications. Unless otherwise notated, contract origination and managed portfolio data discussed herein includes third-party contracts. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may be comprised of multiple components and which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on contracts purchased for our own portfolio for the periods shown: (1) Not applicable to direct lending platform Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and maximizing our risk adjusted yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and by our pricing strategy. We make changes to our pricing algorithm based on our volume goals, our own costs for borrowing and periodic recalibration of our risk-based scoring models. We have offered eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 74% of our new contract acquisitions for our own portfolio in 2021, 75% in 2020, and 76% in 2019, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract if the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy their repurchase obligations to us. Contract Funding For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our funding criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. Our technology and human expertise provides for a 360-degree evaluation of an applicant’s employment and residence stability, income level and affordability, and creditworthiness in relation to the desired collateral securing the automobile contract. This perspective is used to assign application and structure allowances and limits related to price, term, amount of down payment, monthly payment, and interest rate; type of vehicle; and principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle. Specifically, our funding guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 125% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 125% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have more than 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 75 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our funding staff verify the customer's employment, income, residency, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open-ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including traditional and alternative credit history, data derived from other sources such as house/rental payment, length of employment, residence stability and total income. When the dealer proposes a structure for the contract, our scores consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value, payment to income, make and model, vehicle class, and mileage. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Coronavirus Pandemic Beginning in April 2020, we experienced a decrease in monthly contract purchase volumes which continued through December 2020. Since January 2021, our contract purchase levels have returned to pre-pandemic levels. Servicing and Collections We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts we service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; contacting obligors whose payments are late; accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; skip tracing; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. For contracts that we securitize, we are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. For contracts we service for third parties, we receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5%, and certain other incentive fees tied to credit performance. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We engage a nearshore third-party call center to supplement the efforts the collectors in our five branch locations. As of December 31, 2021, our nearshore partner had approximately 26 agents assigned to our portfolio. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our risk-based assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond to our collector’s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector attempts to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of repossessions is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts where the vehicle has been repossessed and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition, we apply a specific reserve to such contracts so that the net balance represents the estimated remaining balance after the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle are applied, net of related costs. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale, the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of late payments is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent. We do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower, regardless of their stage of delinquency are first applied to outstanding accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 25 months, 23 months, and 23 months as of December 31, 2021, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as pandemic, recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession, and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we own as of the respective dates shown. Delinquency and Extension Experience (1) Total Managed Portfolio Number of Contracts Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio _________________ Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. During 2020 we incorporated an algorithmic extension score card which provides our staff with an objective and quantitative assessment of whether or not a obligor is a good candidate for an extension, based on the current circumstances of the account. The extension score card was developed by our internal risk management team and is derived from the post-extension performance of accounts in our managed portfolio. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2021, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2020: Period of Extension We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off as of December 31, 2021 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted, and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, despite the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Number of Contracts Coronavirus Pandemic Beginning in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in the numbers of our obligors who sought an extension because of the pandemic and related economic shutdowns. By June of 2020, the monthly volume of extensions we granted had reverted to levels at or below the prior year and have remained so through December 2021. Government mandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy has impaired and will likely continue to impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 91 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2021, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Amount of Receivables From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining notes had a principal balance of $4.3 million. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in three CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from January 2018 through July 2018, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the eight CPS securitizations conducted from December 2018 through September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. As of December 31, 2021, the notes had a principal balance of $50.0 million. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December 2022, and adding an amortization period through December 2023. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2028. We previously had a third $100 million facility. This facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in 2021. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with several national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. We are subject to supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Human Capital We rely on our employees for everything we do. To make our business work, we seek to supply them with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to new hire training, we provide mentor programs and management workshops. Workforce Allocation and Diversity We had 739 employees as of December 31, 2021. Our employee population was 65% female, and 68% self-identified as ethnically diverse (defined as all EEOC classifications other than white). Broken out by function, our human capital was allocated thus: 9 were senior management personnel; 388 were servicing personnel; 170 were automobile contract origination personnel; 105 were sales personnel and program development (68 of whom were sales representatives); 67 were various administrative personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. Compensation and benefits Our compensation policy is to be market competitive. We offer a benefits and wellness package that includes healthcare coverage, defined contribution retirement benefits, and other components. Employee Engagement Our means of evaluating our human capital resources include, on an individual basis, annual performance reviews, and, on an aggregate basis, a confidential biennial employee climate survey. The survey results are reviewed by senior management and used to assist in reviewing our human capital strategies, programs, and practices. Other metrics used in human capital management include average employee tenure and annual turnover rate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2022. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been from time to time in the past and may be in the future materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2022; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the ten fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. Our business strategy requires that warehouse credit facilities be available in order to purchase significant volumes of receivables. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $100 million. Both warehouse credit facilities have a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. If we are unable to maintain warehouse financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. We experienced improvements in the capital markets from 2010 through 2019, during which time we completed 36 securitizations. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020, and then on a regular quarterly schedule from January 2021 through January 2022. However, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we would expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such a reduction, if it should occur, could have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If Interest Rates Rise, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our principal means of financing our portfolio of automobile contracts is to issue asset-backed notes in securitizations. The interest payable on such notes is our largest expense. Although such expense is fixed with respect to issued securitization trust debt, the terms of future securitizations may vary. The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. As of the date of this report, it is the consensus of market observers that interest rates on risk-free debt will rise within the next year. If interest rates on risk-free debt do increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, If interest rates in general should rise, our expenses would likewise rise, to have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. For our receivables originated prior to January 2018, we maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated.. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Receivables originated since January 2018 are recorded at fair value and incorporate estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a fair value adjustment to those receivables or reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., our President and CEO, has been our President since our formation in 1991. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at their own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. A host of state and local governmental agencies have jurisdiction over material portions of our business, and might take action adverse to us. No assurance can be given as to whether any of such hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. Existing law, regulations and interpretations may change in ways that increase our costs of compliance. In addition to direct costs, such compliance requires changes in forms, processes, procedures, controls and in the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may adopt new investment policies or otherwise impose new expectations that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors, any or all of which may have negative effects on our business and/or reputation. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables executed after December 2016 have been and will be subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage, our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the FTC, the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability. We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We Have Substantial Indebtedness. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,945.7 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $1,760.0 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $105.6 million of warehouse lines of credit, $53.7 million of residual interest financing debt and $26.4 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to five years. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the recorded value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous recorded value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Recorded Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our recorded value, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Have Adverse Effects The COVID-19 virus has spread (“the pandemic”) throughout the world. The pandemic has had adverse effects on the economy of the United States (notably a significant decrease in employment) and the global economy in general. The long-term effects of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the pandemic are unknown. The extent to which obligors on our automobile contracts may be adversely affected by the pandemic, by loss of employment, and by related efforts of governments to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout the nation and world cannot be predicted. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the ability of obligors to make timely payments to us. Stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits made available to much of the population may have ameliorated in part the adverse effects on us of the pandemic; however, the benefit to us of such payments cannot be expected to continue. Obligors’ past use of the stimulus payments, and the termination of enhanced benefits, may have an adverse effect on our receipt of payments from obligors in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, and depending on the extent to which the pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to our business or operations, the ability or willingness of our customers to make timely payments, and risks of geographic concentrations. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Effect of Social, Economic and Other Factors on Losses. The ability of our customers to make payments on automobile contracts will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors, most notably the extent to which our customers remain gainfully employed. Other economic factors include interest rates, general unemployment levels, the rate of inflation, adjustments in monthly mortgage payments and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally and the effect of government stimulus programs and consumer protection/payment relief efforts implemented in connection with the COVID-19 virus. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, consumer attitudes toward bankruptcy and the repayment of indebtedness and consumer perceptions of political events and shifts, which may be affected by the pandemic. We are generally unable to determine whether or to what extent economic or social factors will affect the performance of our portfolio of automobile contracts, but caution that a recession or depression in local, regional or national economies would be expected to increase delinquencies and losses, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2021, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 6.4 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 30%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

See "" Where You Can Find More Information "" and "" Documents Incorporated by Reference. "" Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.7 million, increasing to approximately $1.8 million through 2023. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 129,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $4.3 million, increasing to approximately $4.5 million through 2022. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Lombard, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2023 to 2029. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.3 million. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. There are as of the date of this report two civil actions that could possibly result in a material liability, if resolved adversely and on a class basis, as the respective plaintiffs allege would be appropriate. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. As of the date of this report, no motion for certification of a class has been filed or granted; however, it would be reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2021, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above, and consumer claims. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2021 is $3.4 million, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2021 does not exceed $11.3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2021, we have originated a total of approximately $18.1 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2021 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for third parties. Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2021, most of our staff were working without a significant impact from the pandemic. The pandemic itself, if sufficient numbers of people were to be afflicted, could cause obligors under our automobile contracts to be unable to pay their contractual obligations. As the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is as yet unknown, its direct effect on future obligor payments is likewise uncertain. The mandatory shutdown of large portions of the United States economy pursuant to emergency restrictions has impaired and will impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to pay their contractual obligations. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. Other effects of the pandemic on our operations is referred to throughout this report. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 91 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2021, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December 2022, with an optional amortization period through December 2023. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period to January 2028. We previously had a third $100 million facility. This facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in 2021. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. In a securitization, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Term Securitizations, (d) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (e) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Government mandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy impaired and will likely continue to impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for finance credit losses in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recoded value, an adjustment would be required. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, the Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $4.4 million. The mark down is reflected as a reduction in revenue. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account (“spread account”) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2021, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2021, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $11.3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 91 term securitizations of approximately $16.2 billion in contracts. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently, we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020 and four securitizations in 2021. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were $267.8 million, a decrease of $3.4 million, or 1.2%, from the prior year revenues of $271.2 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $28.7 million, or 9.7%, to $266.3 million from $295.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our legacy portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an average of 20.2%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are net of mark downs of $4.4 million and $29.5 million, respectively, to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. Other income was $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $202.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $251.0 million for the prior year, a decrease of $49.0 million, or 19.5%. The decrease is primarily due to a decreases in interest expense and provisions for credit losses. Employee costs increased by $336,000 or 0.4%, to $80.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, representing 39.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.2 million for the prior year, or 31.9% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for 2021 include approximately $8.0 million for the establishment of a bonus pool for a segment of employees we classify as Managers. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021 and 2020: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $34.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 8.2%, compared to the previous year and represented 17.1% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $26.1 million to $75.2 million, or 25.8%, compared to $101.3 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 37.2% of total operating expenses in 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in interest expense is the decrease in securitzation trust debt interest. Interest on securitization trust debt decreased by $23.6 million, or 26.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 9.8% to $1,819.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally decreased since 2019 and have stayed relatively low in 2021 despite trending upward throughout the year. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 4.4% for 2020. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $3.2 million, or 42.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to the lower utilization of our credit lines during the year. The average balance of our warehouse debt was $51.3 million during 2021 compared to $92.5 million in 2020. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $3.5 million in the prior year as the average balance has increased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes increased by $466,000, or 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $19.3 million in the prior year to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes decreased to 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: _________________________ The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,802.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1,631.5 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance. In the prior year period, we recorded an increase to provision for credit losses for $14.1 million. That provision represented our estimate in 2020 of additional forecasted losses that might be incurred as a result of the pandemic on our portfolio of finance receivables. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded upon our adoption of CECL in January 2020. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense increased by $2.7 million to $16.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. We purchased $1,146.3 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $742.6 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Since then, our contract purchase volumes have gradually increased to pre-pandemic levels. Occupancy expenses increased by $294,000 or 4.0%, to $7.7 million compared to $7.4 million in the previous year and represented 3.8% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by $109,000 or 6.1%, to $1.7 million compared to $1.8 million in the previous year and represented 0.8% of total operating expenses. Income tax expense was $18.2 million in 2021 compared to an income tax benefit of $1.6 million for 2020. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $680,000 and $8.8 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense for 2021 would have been $18.9 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 29%. For 2020, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million for an effective tax rate of 36%. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $271.2 million, a decrease of $74.6 million, or 21.6%, from the prior year revenues of $345.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income and a mark down to the recorded value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $42.1 million, or 12.5%, to $295.0 million from $337.1 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an average of 18.5%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $29.5 million mark down to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. Other income decreased by $3.0 million, or 34.4%, to $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in other income generally resulted from a decrease of $1.3 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers and a decrease of $1.0 million in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $251.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $336.6 million for the prior year, a decrease of $85.6 million, or 25.4%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and interest expense. Employee costs decreased by $679,000 or 0.8%, to $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 31.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.9 million for the prior year, or 24.0% of total operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic, our employee costs were greater than in the first quarter of 2019. Those increases have been partially offset by decreases since the first quarter of 2020, which are the result of staff reductions due in part to the fact that our contract purchases have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. If our contract purchase volumes remain at current levels, we expect lower employee costs in future periods. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021 and 2020: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $32.0 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to the previous year and represented 12.7% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $9.2 million to $101.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to $110.5 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 40.4% of total operating expenses in 2020. Interest on securitization trust debt decreased by $8.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 7.5% to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased in 2017 and 2018 before declining in 2019 and 2020. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $724,000, or 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average rate on the debt was 8.3% in 2020 compared to 9.7% in the prior year while the average balance of the warehouse debt increased to $92.5 million from $86.2 million. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.8 million in the prior year as the average balance has decreased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes increased by $741,000, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $15.0 million in the prior year to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: ___________________ The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,631.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,212.2 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. Provision for credit losses was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision represents our estimate of additional losses that may be incurred on the portfolio of finance receivables resulting from the pandemic. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded with the adoption of CECL in January 2020. In the prior year period, prior to the adoption of CECL, provision for credit losses was $85.8 million. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense decreased by $3.7 million to $14.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and represented 5.7% of total operating expenses. We purchased $742.6 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,002.8 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Subsequently, our contract purchase volumes have increased but have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Occupancy expenses decreased by $66,000 or 0.9%, to $7.4 million compared to $7.5 million in the previous year and represented 3.0% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $709,000 or 65.9%, to $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million in the previous year and represented 0.6% of total operating expenses. Income tax benefit was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes an $8.8 million tax benefit. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $8.8 million. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 36%. For the prior year period, income tax expense was $3.8 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 41%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $198.2 million, $238.8 million and $216.8 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $115.4 million. This compares to net cash provided by investing activities of $93.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 was $229.4 million. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $1,107.5 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $739.7 million and $1,004.2 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $50.4 million and $328.5 million, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 was $23.3 million. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $1,110.7 million in new securitization trust debt in 2021 compared to $714.5 million in 2020 and $1,000.5 million in 2019. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,153.1 million, $1,010.0 million and $966.1 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash of $29.9 million and $94.0 million aggregate available borrowings under our two warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $71.3 million of such eligible collateral. During 2021, we completed four securitizations aggregating $1,110.7 million of notes sold. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. Our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,945.7 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $1,760.0 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $105.6 million of warehouse lines of credit, $53.7 million of residual interest financing debt and $26.4 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to five years. Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands): ___________________ We anticipate repaying debt due in 2022 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In December 2020, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2022 and to include an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2021 there was $70.6 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in April 2015. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023. In February 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date and elected not to renew it. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. At December 31, 2021 there was $35.4 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2022, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to January 2024 followed by an amortization period through January 2028 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. At December 31, 2021 there was $4.3 million outstanding under this facility. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $50 million securitization of residual interests from other previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $50.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2021 there was $50.0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes and the 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 41 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $1,760.0 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2021. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2021 there were $26.4 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""estimates,"" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the abilty of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts; and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This report includes Consolidated Financial Statements, notes thereto and an Independent Auditors’ Report, at the pages indicated below, in the "" Index to Financial Statements. "" Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "" Exchange Act "" ) as of December 31, 2021 (the "" Evaluation Date "" ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report. Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

March 15, 2022 By: /s/ CHARLES E. BRADLEY, JR. Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this report has been signed below by the following persons on behalf of the registrant and in the capacities and on the dates indicated. March 15, 2022 /s/ CHARLES E. BRADLEY, JR. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Director, President and Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) March 15, 2022 /s/ CHRIS A. ADAMS March 15, 2022 /s/ WILLIAM B. ROBERTS March 15, 2022 /s/ GREGORY S. WASHER March 15, 2022 /s/ DANIEL S. WOOD March 15, 2022 /s/ JEFFREY P. FRITZ Jeffrey P. Fritz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Las Vegas, Nevada Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph - Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Loans at Fair Value As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company carries all finance receivables acquired after 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company had $1.7 billion in finance receivables that are carried at fair value, all of which are classified as level 3 fair values as they contain one or more inputs which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. With assistance from an outside valuation expert, the Company used a level 3 fair value methodology for the fair value of finance receivables. The significant assumptions used by the Company to calculate the fair value of these financial receivables include the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivables. These significant assumptions were based on the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. We identified the valuation of finance receivables carried at fair value as a critical audit matter as this estimate requires subjective auditor judgment. Our principal considerations in making this determination are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by the Company in determining the assumptions to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these finance receivables, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Our primary audit procedures to address this critical audit matter included: Allowance for Finance Credit Losses – Qualitative Factors Related to the CECL Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a gross receivables portfolio of $232.4 million and a related allowance for finance credit losses (ACL) on loans of $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management estimates the allowance using relevant information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on the calendar quarter of origination is used to estimate expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. This estimate is adjusted by certain qualitative factors that may impact future credit losses. The qualitative factors represent management’s estimate of the impact of future losses. The use of qualitative factors to adjust historical losses for management’s forecast requires significant judgment. Management applies qualitative factors to adjust its estimation of the timing and amount losses to represent its future economic forecast. We identified auditing the reasonableness of qualitative factors used to create forecasts in its credit loss model as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: /s/ CROWE LLP Dallas, Texas March 15, 2022 173 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. (""CPS"") was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”) specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts (""Contracts"") originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers (“Dealers”) located throughout the United States. Customers located in California, Ohio, Texas, Florida, Indiana, and Pennsylvania represented 10.9 %, 9.3 %, 6.1 %, 5.0 %, 5.0 %, 4.6 % and respectively, of contracts purchased during 2021 compared with 13.5 %, 11.1 %, 5.1 %, 4.6 %, 5.4 %, and 3.4 % respectively in 2020. No other state had a concentration in excess of 4.6% in 2021. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80 % owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2021, our unrestricted cash balance was $ 29.9 million, which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. For the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $ 29.5 million and $ 4.4 million, respectively. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for current expected credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the recorded value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred . Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $ 2.5 million and $ 3.8 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Treatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create “overcollateralization” of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: Earnings Per Share Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the related period. The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Incremental shares of 5.7 million, 13.6 million and 11.3 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation , that generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of stock options, restricted stock or other equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is recognized for awards issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. This cost is recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These are material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2021 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2021, which represents our estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"")Topic 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. To establish such lifetime credit loss estimates, consideration of a broadened range of reasonable and supportable information to establish credit loss estimates is required. ASC 326 was initially scheduled to become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, however on October 16, 2019, the FASB changed the effective date for smaller reporting companies to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the CECL model. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method, and not a current period expense. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the estimated potential effect on credit performance resulting from the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. We recorded a $ 14.1 million charge to the provision for credit losses for the legacy portfolio accounted for under CECL and a $ 29.5 million mark down to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses in the amount of $ 14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance.We measure our portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value with consideration for unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio. The pandemic and the adverse effect it may have on the U.S. economy and our obligors may cause us to consider significant changes in any of those inputs, which in turn may have a significant effect on our fair value measurement. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 146.6 million and $ 130.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $ 49.0 million and $ 52.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key terms such as interest rate, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance receivables totaling $ 2.7 million and $ 5.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. Allowance for Credit Losses – Finance Receivables The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. We measure the weighted average monthly incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant historical period, we consider each pool’s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the results of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool’s most recent actual cumulative net loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on older vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history, job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly, for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics between various segments of our portfolio. Our methodology incorporates historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore, the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape, the Company’s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. In consideration of the depth and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently, we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those factors into our estimates. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the amortized cost basis of our finance receivables by annual vintage as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: At the adoption of CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $ 127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a reduction to provision for credit losses on finance receivables in the amount of $ 14.6 million. The reserve decrease was primarily due to a decrease in lifetime expected credit losses resulting from improved credit performance, an improved macroeconomic outlook and higher used car prices. The Company made additional provisions for credit losses of $ 14.1 million for the year ended December 30, 2020. Those reserve increases were made in consideration for the uncertainty associated with the pandemic. The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $ 1,675,000 , $ 1,784,000 , and $ 1,076,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were $ 21,000 in equipment disposals during the year ended December 31, 2021. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 12.0 million and $ 10.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2021. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2021, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $ 146.6 million. Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized below: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 400,000 and $ 1.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 83.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In December 2020, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2022 and to include an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2021 there was $ 70.6 million outstanding under this facility. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2021 there was $ 35.4 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date. This facility was most recently renewed in February 2022, extending the revolving period to January 2024, followed by an amortization period of January 2028. The total outstanding debt on our three warehouse lines of credit was $ 106 .0 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $ 120.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2020. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $ 40 .0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $ 40 .0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. At December 31, 2021 there was $ 4.3 million outstanding under this facility. On June 30, 2021, we completed a $ 50 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $ 50 .0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in eleven CPS securitizations consecutively issued from January 2018 and September 2020. The sold notes (“2021-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2021-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 7.86%. At December 31, 2021 there was $ 50 .0 million outstanding under this facility. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 and 2021-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 629,000 and $ 150,000 as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of our outstanding subordinated renewable notes as of December 31, 2021: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2021, we purchased 3,884,876 shares of our common stock at an average price of $ 6.61 . In November and December 2021 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 13.68 million of our common stock. There is approximately $ 7.2 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015, July 2018 and again in November 2021, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000, 19,200,000 and 22,200,000 , respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 2.65 , $ 1.33 and $ 1.11 , respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 79 % to 71 % for 2021, 72 % to 80 % for 2020, and 37 % to 39 % for 2019. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $ 2.0 million, $ 1.9 million and $ 2.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $ 4.9 million. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $ 13.1 million and $ 11.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $ 9.7 million and $ 8.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 9.0 million and $ 1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2021 and cash of $ 6.0 million was received. At December 31, 2021, there were a total of 3,881,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 for stock options under the 2006 and 1997 plans is as follows: Number of Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term The following table presents the price distribution of stock options outstanding and exercisable for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: We did not issue any stock options with an exercise price above or below the market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was adopted, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has such NOLs reflected on its balance sheet as a portion of deferred tax assets. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the provisions of the CARES Act provide for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. Consequently, the Company has revalued the benefit from its NOLs to reflect a 35 % tax rate. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit reflected in income taxes of $ 680 ,000 and $ 8.8 million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $ 19.6 million as of December 31, 2021 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $19.6 million consists of approximately $ 12.2 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $ 7.4 million of net state deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $ 42.4 million. These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2021, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2018. (10) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, equipment, software and hardware. The Company has entered into operating leases for the majority of its real estate locations, primarily office space. These leases are generally for periods of three to seven years with various renewal options. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine if a contract contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the leases expense included in Occupancy, General and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: The following table presents the supplemental cash flow information related to leases: Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. There are as of the date of this report two civil actions that could possibly result in a material liability, if resolved adversely and on a class basis, as the respective plaintiffs allege would be appropriate. Following our filing of a complaint for a deficiency judgment in the Superior Court at Waterbury, Connecticut, the defendant filed a cross-claim alleging that our deficiency notices were not compliant with Connecticut law, and seeking relief on behalf of a class of Connecticut obligors whose vehicles we had repossessed. The defendant’s contract provided for resolution of disputes exclusively by arbitration, and exclusively on an individual basis, not a class basis. Nevertheless, in August 2021, the court denied our motion to compel arbitration, without opinion. As of the date of this report, no motion for certification of a class has been filed or granted; however, it would be reasonable to expect that resolution of these claims will be on a class basis. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2021, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above, and consumer claims. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2021 is $ 3.4 million, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2021 does not exceed $ 11.3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (11) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $ 2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $ 1.3 million, $ 1.4 million, and $ 1.6 million respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2021 and 2020: Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25 % per annum as of December 31, 2021. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. The estimated net gain that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2022 is $ 1.2 million. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, by asset category, is as follows: ________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (12) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2021, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $ 4.3 million. We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $ 1.9 million, which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 57 %, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $ 2.4 million. The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2020 was $ 3.8 million after applying a valuation adjustment of $ 11.8 million. There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2021 and 2020. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13) Subsequent Events On February 2, 2022 we executed our first securitization of 2022. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $316.8 million of asset-backed notes secured by $330.0 million in automobile receivables originated by CPS. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2022-A, consist of five classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Standard & Poor’s and DBRS Morningstar, and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and CPS’s experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 2.54%. The 2022-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance and overcollateralization of 4.00%. The transaction agreements require accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 8.40% of the original receivable pool balance, or 25.80% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction utilizes a pre-funding structure, in which CPS sold approximately $217.8 million of receivables at inception and plans to sell approximately $112.2 million of additional receivables in February 2022. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. ",0000889609,CPSS

Executive Officers The information regarding the Company’s executive officers set forth in Part I of this report under the caption “Executive Officers of the Registrant” is incorporated herein by reference. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Directors, executive officers and holders of in excess of 10% of the Company's common stock are required to file reports concerning their transactions in and holdings of equity securities of the Company. Based on a review of reports filed by each such person, and inquiry of each regarding holdings and transactions, the Company believes that all reports required with respect to the year 2020 were timely filed, except that one report of a disposition of 4,477 shares by a senior vice president, Chris Terry, was filed late. Code of Ethics The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, controller and others. A copy of the Code of Ethics may be obtained at no charge by written request to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices. Audit and Other Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating Committee. Each of these three committees operates under a written charter, adopted by the Board of Directors. The charters are available on the Company’s website, www.consumerportfolio.com/charters.html . The Board of Directors has concluded that each member of these three committees (every director other than Mr. Bradley, the Company's chief executive officer), is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them have a material relationship with the Company that would impair their independence from management or otherwise compromise the ability to act as an independent director. The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Wood (chairman), Mr. Rayhill and Mr. Washer. The Audit Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to review the financial books and records of the Company in consultation with the Company's accounting and auditing staff and its independent auditors and to review with the accounting staff and independent auditors any questions that may arise with respect to accounting and auditing policy and procedure. The Board of Directors has further determined that Mr. Wood has the qualifications and experience necessary to serve as an ""audit committee financial expert"" as such term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Mr. Wood, as president of Carclo Technical Plastics, was responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the audited financial statements of that company. Item 11. Executive Compensation. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee directors Chris Adams (chairman), William Roberts and Daniel Wood. From December 2007 through January 2019, Mr. Roberts held $4,000,000 of subordinated notes issued by the Company. The board of directors considered whether such holdings would reasonably be expected to impair Mr. Roberts’ exercise of independent judgment, and concluded that his independence was not impaired. In coming to that conclusion, the board noted that the Company’s repayment obligation was subordinated to all other debt of the Company, creating a near-alignment of interest with the holders of common stock, and also noted Mr. Roberts’ substantial beneficial ownership of Company common stock. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this report. Based on such review and discussions and relying thereon, we have recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Chris A. Adams (chairman) William B. Roberts Daniel S. Wood Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2020 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Outcome The Compensation Committee annually considers the results of the most recent advisory vote by shareholders to approve executive officer compensation. In the 2020 advisory vote, a majority of the voted shares (65.7%) approved of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee has noted the substantial negative vote, but has determined to retain the existing design, purposes and structure of our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive officer compensation in its future administration of executive compensation. Compensation Objectives The Company's objectives with respect to compensation are several. The significant objectives are to cause compensation (i) to be sufficient in total amount to provide reasonable assurance of retaining key executives, (ii) to include a significant contingent component, so as to provide strong incentives to meet designated Company objectives, and (iii) to include a significant component tied to the price of the Common Stock, so as to align management's incentives with shareholder interests. The compensation committee (""Committee"") of the Company's Board of Directors is charged with administering the Company’s compensation plans to meet those objectives. To the extent that elements of compensation would not advance such objectives, or would do so less effectively than would other elements, the Committee seeks to avoid paying compensation in those forms. Role of the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer Our Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, to make all decisions regarding executive compensation, including administration of our compensation plans. In that regard, the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is authorized to form subcommittee(s) and to retain experts and consultants to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. To date it has not done so. The chief executive officer, who attends meetings of the Compensation Committee by invitation of the Committee’s chairman, assists the Committee in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by, among other things: The other executive officers do not have a role in determining their own compensation, other than to discuss their annual individual performance objectives and results achieved with the chief executive officer. Our Overall Approach The Committee has put into place a compensation system consisting of three key components: base salary, an annual cash bonus pursuant to an incentive plan, and long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options. The table below provides comparative information regarding the components of our year 2020 executive compensation program. We are applying the same elements in our executive compensation program for the year 2021. The Committee has from time to time considered providing additional elements of executive compensation. It has considered elements such as restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, compensation contingent on a change in control, defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation, and supplemental retirement plans (supplemental in the sense that they exceed the limits for tax advantaged treatment). To date, the Committee has elected not to pay compensation in such forms, having determined that the Company's objectives are better met by one or more of the elements of compensation that it does pay. Regarding restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Committee has noted that any form of equity equivalent to or closely tied to common stock does serve to meet the objective of aligning officers' personal interest with that of the shareholders generally. The Committee believes, however, that the objective is better met by grants of stock options than by grants of share equivalents, because recipients of the grants will face the same degree of variance in results at a lesser cost to the Company, when option grants are compared to grants of restricted stock units. Further, unlike restricted stock, option grants will not provide a reward to the holder absent an improvement over time in the Company’s stock price. The committee has elected not to provide material perquisites as compensation, having determined that cash is a better medium of exchange. Regarding compensation that would be payable contingent on a change in control of the Company, the Committee believes that there are certain legitimate objectives to be met by such contingent compensation. As of the date of this proxy statement, however, no such contingent compensation plans are in place. Regarding defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation and supplemental retirement plans, the Committee believes that the Company's retention objective is better met by straight cash payments, whether in the form of base salary or in the form of bonus compensation. In particular with respect to plans for deferred compensation, the Committee believes those make sense for the Company and for the recipient only on the basis of assumptions regarding future tax rates payable by each. Having no assurance that such assumptions would be correct, the Committee has chosen not to put into place any special deferred compensation programs for the company’s executive officers. Those officers do participate in a company-sponsored tax-deferred savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, on the same terms available to company employees generally. The Committee may in the future revisit its conclusions as to any of the components discussed above, or may consider other forms of compensation. The Base Salary Element With respect to the retention objective, the Committee considers an executive's base salary to be the most critical component. Acting primarily on the basis of recommendations of the chief executive officer, the Committee adjusts other officers' base salaries annually, with the adjustment generally consisting of a 2% to 10% increase from the prior year's rate. Where exceptional circumstances apply, such as recruitment of a new executive officer, a promotion to executive officer status or a special need to retain an individual officer, the chief executive officer may recommend, and the Committee may approve, a larger increase. The Company's general approach in setting the annual compensation of its named executive officers is to set those officers’ base compensation by reference to their base rates for the preceding year. During the year ended December 2020, the Company's chief executive officer, Charles E. Bradley, Jr., received $995,000 in base salary. In setting that rate in the first quarter of 2020, the Committee considered the base salary rate that the Company had paid in the prior year ($995,000), the desirability of providing an annual increase, the desirability of ensuring retention of the services of the Company's incumbent chief executive officer, the Company’s financial performance, and the levels of chief executive officer compensation prevailing among other financial services companies. The Committee considered whether to adjust officers’ base compensation for 2020, and determined not to increase the base rate for the chief executive officer, nor generally for the other named executive officers. The Committee did approve an upward adjustment of somewhat under 2% to Ms. Robinson’s base rate, making hers equal to Ms. Straten’s. The Annual Incentive Bonus (EMB) element To encourage executive officers and key management personnel to exercise their best efforts and management skills toward causing the Company to meet its overall objective, and toward achieving designated specific individual objectives, the Company has implemented an Executive Management Bonus Plan, with annual payouts. Under the Company's bonus plan as applied to the year ended December 2020, the Company’s two executive vice presidents (each of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 160% of their base salaries, and the Company’s senior vice presidents (two of whom are among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 120% of their base salaries. The chief executive officer was eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 600% of his base salary. The implementation of this element for the year 2020 is discussed below. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Element The Committee also awards incentive and non-qualified stock options under the Company's stock option plans. Such awards are designed to assist in the retention of key executives and management personnel and to create an incentive to create shareholder value over a sustained period of time. The Company believes that stock options are a valuable tool in compensating and retaining employees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Committee granted stock options to the Company's executive officers. All such grants were awarded on June 1, 2020, and all carry exercise prices equal to the market price for the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The terms of such options are described below, under the caption ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year."" The numbers of shares made subject to each of the option grants were based on various factors relating to the responsibilities of the individual officers and to the extent of previous grants to such individuals. Because the exercise price of all options granted is equal to or above the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, the option holders may realize value only if the stock price appreciates from the price on the date the options were granted. This design is intended to focus executives on the enhancement of shareholder value over the long term. Other Elements The Company also maintains certain broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical and dental insurance, and a qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k) plan), in which executive officers are permitted to participate. Such officers participate on the same terms as non-executive personnel who meet applicable eligibility criteria, and are subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the benefits that may be payable under the plans. The Company does not maintain any form of defined benefit pension or retirement plan in which executive officers may participate, nor does it maintain any form of supplemental retirement savings or supplemental deferred compensation plan. Exercise of Discretion In exercising its discretion as to the level of executive compensation and its components, the Committee considers a number of factors. Members of the Committee conduct informal surveys of compensation paid to comparable executives within and without the consumer finance industry. The Committee finds these data useful primarily in evaluating the overall level of compensation paid or to be paid to the Company's executive officers. The Committee noted that the Company met and exceeded its budget objectives for the year. Operational factors considered included individual and group management goals; indicators of the performance and credit quality of the Company's servicing portfolio, including levels of delinquencies and charge-offs; and indicators of successful management of personnel, including employee stability. All of such factors are assessed with reference to the judgment of the Committee as to the degree of difficulty of achieving desired outcomes. With respect to payment of annual bonuses and grants of stock options, the Committee also takes note of factors relating to the degree of the Company's success over the most recent year. Specific Objectives and Evaluation In the December 2019 and January 2020 the compensation committee designated specific objectives with respect to the chief executive officer to be accomplished within the year 2020, and fixed weights to be associated with each such objective. The chief executive officer proposed to the committee specific annual objectives with respect to each other executive officer of the company, which the committee, after making certain modifications, approved. These objectives and the Committee’s administration of the annual incentive bonus element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “ - Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year - Executive Management Bonus Plan.” Grants of Options The Committee's award of stock options to the Company's officers in June 2020 included option grants to the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. In determining the appropriate level of such grant, the Committee considered the long-term performance of the chief executive officer and the desirability of providing significant incentive for future performance, as well as the desirability of ensuring that officer's continued retention by the Company, and the various factors noted above with respect to option grants generally. These grants and the Committee’s administration of the long-term incentive element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “-Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year – Equity Incentives.” Stock Ownership, Hedging and Pledging . Our board of directors and compensation committee have considered whether to establish a minimum stock ownership goal for members of our senior management. We have elected not to do so, considering that such a policy would either be strict and mandatory, in which case it would undermine the compensatory objectives of our equity compensation plans, or would be merely hortatory, in which case it could be expected to have little effect. We’ve also noted that the multiyear vesting terms of the equity incentives granted under our plans have the effect of aligning our executives’ individual personal financial incentives with the future price performance of the Company’s stock. As part of our comprehensive compliance policy, we remind all company executive officers of the mandatory legal prohibition on selling short company shares. We also prohibit company executive officers from entering into transactions that would have the effect of causing those individuals to benefit from a decline in the price of the company stock, such as the purchase of “put” options. We prohibit such “hedging” transactions but we do not find it appropriate to prohibit our executive officers from pledging their shares of company stock as security for a loan. We believe that the beneficial incentives of owning company stock remain substantially the same with or without such a pledge. Summary of Compensation The following table summarizes all compensation earned during the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 by the Company's chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and the other three most highly compensated individuals (such five individuals, the ""named executive officers"") who were serving in such position or as executive officers at any time in 2020. It lists their names, the principal positions in which they served in those years, and each component of compensation paid with respect to those years. Summary Compensation Table Year All Other Compen- sation (2) Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year Equity Incentives In the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not grant any stock awards or stock appreciation rights to any of our named executive officers. We granted options to substantially all of our management level employees on June 1, 2020. The option grants noted in the tables above and below were awarded to the named executive officers as part of those grants. We also granted awards under our Executive Management Bonus Plan, which were evaluated and paid out after the end of the year. The amounts paid are shown in the table above (Summary Compensation Table) as “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” In the June 2020 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 240,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($2.47 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. Each of the other executive officers of the Company received a grant at that time on the same terms. Mr. Fritz and Mr. Lavin received such grants with respect to 90,000 shares and 150,000 shares, respectively, and the other named executive officers of the Company each received such a grant with respect to 80,000 shares. The table below provides information regarding the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2020. Grants of Plan-Based Awards The “target” and “maximum” figures appearing in the table above represent the maximum cash payout under the individual executives’ Executive Management Bonus Plan awards as of the date the incentive was fixed. The actual payout to each individual named in the table above has been determined and paid prior to the date of this proxy statement. That amount was in each case materially less than the maximum (approximately 44% of the maximum, in the case of the chief executive). The respective actual payments are described below, and appear above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading “Non-Equity Plan Compensation.” Because each non-equity incentive plan award has been settled and paid, the future payout under such awards as of the date of this report is in each case zero. The “grant date fair value” figures appearing in the table above, which are the computed fair values of stock option awards, are computed as described in note 1 to the Summary Compensation Table. Executive Management Bonus Plan The Executive Management Bonus Plan award granted to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley, called for him to meet as many as possible of seven separate operational and financial objectives within the year 2020. The Compensation Committee assigned to each of those objectives a value as a percentage of base salary. The objectives and their weightings were as follows: to meet the Company’s quarterly budgeted earnings (25% each quarter, total of 100%), to raise $70 million or more of debt capital (50%), to renew, extend or replace one or more warehouse credit facilities (50%, pro rata if less than a two-year revolving term), to acquire a material new servicing portfolio (100%), to execute four rated securitization transactions (40% each, 160% total), to increase the Company’s annual originations of receivables to each of three targets (60% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching aggregate amounts of $800 million, $900 million, and $1.0 billion), and to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in excess of each of four targets (80% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching prices of $5.00, $5.50, $6.00 and $6.50 per share). The total of the seven weightings is 600%; accordingly, the target and maximum possible value to that officer of the award was 600% of his base salary for 2020. In a series of meetings, the committee evaluated the chief executive’s performance in comparison to the goals. The Compensation Committee determined that the budget objective was met in all four quarters of 2020, and credited the chief executive with the maximum value, or 100%. The Company did not raise new capital, nor acquire a material portfolio, and the Committee found no credit was earned in those respects. The Committee also determined that the December renewal of a warehouse line was on beneficial terms and for a full two years, and credited the chief executive with the full 50% designated for that objective. The Committee noted that the Company had executed three rated securitizations during the year, representing creditable performance of 120%. It determined that our originations volume was less than the minimum target. The Committee considered applying an allowance to the originations volume target, in light of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, but determined not to vary the objective, and thus evaluated creditable performance at zero with respect to the originations objective. The Committee noted that none of the stock price objectives were fulfilled. The aggregate valuation of all creditable performance for the chief executive officer was thus 270%, which would imply a bonus payment under our Executive Management Bonus Plan of $2,686,500. The committee elected to pay a bonus of somewhat less than the maximum creditable percentage, in the amount of $2,600,000, representing 261% of our chief executive’s base salary. The Executive Management Bonus Plan awards granted to the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer are evaluated on a more subjective basis, and were set by the Compensation Committee in consultation with and on the recommendation of the chief executive officer. Factors used in determining the amount of bonus for the two named executive officers who are executive vice presidents of the Company are these: (I) an evaluation of the executive’s skills and performance, 43.6%, (II) whether the executive has met two individual objectives approved by the compensation committee, 26.2% in aggregate, (III) whether the Company as a whole has met or exceeded budget targets, 17.5%, (IV) a subjective evaluation of the officer's performance, 29.1%, and (V) a discretionary allocation recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee, 43.6%. Numerical scores are assigned to each of these factors, up to the maximum percentages stated above, and can result in a maximum bonus of 160% of base compensation. Similar factors are applied in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are senior vice presidents of the Company: (I) skills and performance, 30%, (II) two individual objectives, 18%, (III) Company budget, 12%, (IV) subjective evaluation of that executive’s department, 20%, and (V) discretionary allocation, 30%, resulting in a maximum bonus of 110% of base compensation. Following the end of the year 2020, our compensation committee evaluated each named executive officer’s performance in relation to these standards and goals. The Company met its overall budget target in each quarter, and each officer accordingly received full credit with respect to that target. With respect to the individual factors, the compensation committee, acting in part on the advice of our chief executive officer, determined that creditable performance for 2020 for each named executive officer other than the chief executive officer was as set forth below: On that basis, the Compensation Committee approved payments to these named executive officers in the amounts shown in the rightmost column. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2020 the number of unexercised options held by each of the named executive officers, the number of shares subject to then exercisable and unexercisable options held by such persons and the exercise price and expiration date of each such option. Each option referred to in the table was granted at an option price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the date of grant. None of such individuals holds a stock award; accordingly, only information concerning option awards is presented. (1) Becomes exercisable as to the unexercisable portion on May 17, 2021. (2) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-half of the unexercisable portion on May 9, 2021 and 2022. (3) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of one-third of the unexercisable portion on August 8, 2021, 2022 and 2023. (4) Becomes exercisable as to cumulative increments of 25% of the unexercisable portion on June 1, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year Three of the five named executive officers exercised stock options during 2020. The table below shows the realized value and the number of options exercised for those three individuals. None of our officers hold stock awards; accordingly, no stock awards vested during 2020. Option Exercises and Stock Vested (1) The value realized is the difference between the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of exercise (the closing price reported by Nasdaq) and the exercise price of the option. Executive Management Bonus Plan (Non-equity Incentive Plan) The salary and cash bonus of the named executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation appearing in the Summary Compensation Table above under the caption ""Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"" is paid pursuant to an executive management bonus plan (the “EMB Plan”). The EMB Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee selects participants in the EMB Plan from among the Company’s executive officers and determines the performance goals, target amounts and other terms and conditions of awards under the EMB Plan. With respect to officers other than the chief executive officer, determinations of base salary and of criteria relating to the EMB Plan are based in part on evaluations of such officers prepared by the chief executive officer, which are furnished to and discussed with the Compensation Committee. Director Compensation Throughout 2020, we paid our non-employee directors a retainer of $5,167 per month, with an additional fee of $500 per month for service on a board committee ($1,000 for a committee chairman). Non-employee directors also received per diem fees of $1,000 for attendance in person at meetings of the board of directors, or $500 for attendance by telephone. No per diem fees are paid for attendance at committee meetings. The Board in 2020 approved issuance to each non-employee director of options to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares. The exercise prices of all such options are the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which was $2.47 per share. The following table summarizes compensation received by our directors for the year 2020: (1) This column reports cash compensation earned in 2020 for Board and committee service. (2) This column represents the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 2020 fiscal year for the fair value of stock options granted to the directors in 2020. The fair value was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS 123R. The fair value per option was $1.31, based on assumptions of 3.24 years expected life, expected volatility of 80.17%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and a risk-free rate of 0.21%. In addition to the stock option awards granted in 2020, our directors held at December 31, 2020 option awards granted in previous years. The total options held at December 31, 2020 represent the right to purchase shares as follows: Mr. Bradley, 3,539,999 shares; Mr. Adams, 330,000 shares; Mr. Grasso, 30,000 shares; Mr. Rayhill, 435,000 shares; Mr. Roberts, 180,000 shares; Mr. Washer, 330,000 shares; and Mr. Wood, 345,000 shares. (3) Mr. Bradley's compensation as chief executive officer of the Company is described elsewhere in this report. He received no additional compensation for service on the Company's Board of Directors. Pension Plans The Company's officers do not participate in any pension or retirement plan, other than a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (commonly known as a 401(k) plan). Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control This section provides information regarding payments and benefits to the named executive officers that would be triggered by termination of the officer’s employment (including resignation, or voluntary termination; severance, or involuntary termination; and retirement) or a change of control of the Company. Each of the named executive officers is an at-will employee and, as such, does not have an employment contract. In addition, if the officer’s employment terminates for any reason other than a change of control of the Company, any unvested stock options are terminated, and vested options become subject to accelerated expiration: ordinarily three months following separation from service, or twelve months in the case of disability, retirement or death. Accordingly, there are no payments or benefits that are triggered by any termination event (including resignation and severance) other than in connection with a change of control of the Company. Benefits Triggered by Change of Control or Termination after Change of Control Our stock option plans provide that each employee of ours who holds outstanding unexpired options under our stock option may have the right to exercise such options following a change of control of the Company, without regard to the date such option would first be exercisable. Each of the named executive officers holds such options. The “acceleration” of options is mandatory following certain changes of control, and subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee following certain others. Acceleration is mandatory in the event of (i) the sale, or other disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (ii) a merger or similar transaction in which shareholders of the Company hold less than 50% of the shares of the surviving entity; provided, however, that acceleration following a merger or similar transaction is mandatory only if the holder suffers a Qualifying Termination (defined below) within one year following the transaction, or if the surviving entity does not provide the holder with an equivalent award. Acceleration is also mandatory if a holder suffers a Qualifying Termination within one year following (iii) a change within a three-year period in the membership of a majority of the board of directors (excluding changes recommended by the board), or (iv) a person’s acquisition of outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than directly from the Company and without approval of the board, resulting in that person’s having beneficial ownership of greater than 25% of the Company. Under our stock option plans, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to provide for acceleration under other circumstances than those described above with respect to any particular stock option or class of stock options. The committee would expect to exercise its discretion with the intention of preserving the value of the stock option award. To date, such discretion has not been exercised. A “Qualifying Termination” is a termination of the holder’s employment by the Company other than for cause, disability or death, or by the holder for “good reason” (principally relating to a material diminution in the holder’s authority, compensation or responsibilities, or a relocation of greater than 50 miles). The preceding description applies to options held by officers and employees. Options issued to non-employee directors accelerate without the exercise of discretion upon any of the four categories of change of control described above. As of December 31, 2020, each of the named executive officers would realize a benefit if unvested stock options were to become immediately exercisable upon a change in control, based on the value of the shares underlying such options at the closing market price on December 31, 2020 , which was $4.24 per share. The respective amounts of such possible benefit are set forth in the following table: Management Structure The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company. Its oversight is aimed at seeing to it that the company’s business is managed to meet our goals, and that the interests of the shareholders are served. Charles E. Bradley currently serves as both the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer, and is the only member of our board who is not independent of the Company. Largely because of the small number of directors (six members in total), our board has chosen not to designate any individual formally as the lead independent director. Each director retains his full oversight responsibility. Our board structure supports the independence of our non-management directors. Our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee are each composed solely of independent directors. Our bylaws provide that any two directors have the authority to call meetings of the board of directors, as do specified officers, including the president and the secretary. To enhance the possible use of that authority by independent directors, the corporate secretary is under standing instructions to call a meeting at the instance of any one director. The board believes that combining the chairman and chief executive officer positions is currently the most effective leadership structure given Mr. Bradley’s in-depth knowledge of our business and industry and his demonstrated ability to formulate and implement strategic initiatives. Mr. Bradley is continuously involved in developing and implementing our strategies, working closely with the company’s other senior executives to seek continued disciplined growth and excellence in operations. His close involvement in management places Mr. Bradley in the best position to decide which business issues require consideration by the independent directors of the board. In addition, having a combined chairman and chief executive officer enables us to speak with a unified voice to shareholders, customers and others concerned with our company. The board believes that combining the chief executive and chairman roles, as part of a governance structure that includes oversight of management responsibilities by independent directors, provides the preferred system for meeting the requirement that the Company be managed in the best interest of our shareholders. Risk Oversight The board’s overall responsibility for directing the management of the company includes risk oversight. The risk oversight function is performed at the board level, and by the Audit and Compensation Committees. The board of directors as a whole in its regular meetings discusses and considers the risk inherent in the existing business of the Company and in proposed initiatives. Because the Company’s business consists of extending consumer credit to individuals believed to be of higher risk than others (sub-prime credit), the assessment of the risk assumed in such extensions of credit is a primary consideration on the part of the board. Risk oversight is also a key function of the Audit and Compensation Committees. The principal risk management function performed by the Audit Committee is the ongoing assessment of the credit estimates and allowances periodically recorded in the Company’s books. The committee reviews that assessment regularly. Other risk assessments performed by the Audit Committee include assessments of contingent liabilities, and of other reserves and allowances. The principal risk management functions performed by the Compensation Committee are its setting and evaluation of objectives for the chief executive officer, in connection with its administration of the executive management bonus plan. The committee recognizes that the company’s business of extending subprime credit inherently includes a conflict between growing the business and managing the risk of credit losses: one means to increase the company’s business is to offer credit on terms that are priced too low for the risk assumed. The Compensation Committee manages that risk by insisting that objectives to grow the business are qualified by a mandate that credit quality be maintained at appropriate levels. To some extent, such risk management is shared with the Audit Committee, which performs the primary oversight of whether credit risk assumed is reflected with adequate allowances in the company’s financial statements. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The table below sets forth the number and percentage of shares of the our Common Stock (our only class of voting securities) owned beneficially as of April 27, 2021 (the latest practicable date) by (i) each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director and each named executive officer, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers, as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property and similar laws, each of the persons named has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned by such persons. Percent of class is calculated by reference to 22,653,020 shares outstanding on April 27, 2021. Except as otherwise noted, each person named in the table has a mailing address at 3800 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 1400, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents inform a tion regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2020. CEO Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a mandate that public companies disclose the ratio of the compensation of their CEO to their median employee. Our CEO-median employee pay ratio calculation for 2020 is 72:1. We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2020 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2020 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. Having computed this ratio by reference to the same employee originally identified for the year 2017, we reviewed the compensation of all employees who were actively employed on December 31, 2020, and identified the median-compensated employee for the year then ended. We then computed the ratio by reference to that employee’s total compensation, which was $54,351. The total compensation of the CEO Charles Bradley in 2020 was $3,914,056. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Citigroup. On July 10, 2008, CPS and its wholly owned subsidiary Folio Funding II, LLC, as borrower, agreed with Citigroup Financial Products Inc. (“CGFP”), an affiliate of Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), to amend and restate the agreements governing a pre-existing revolving residual credit facility. CGFP was the note purchaser in and administrative agent of that credit facility. The amendments included the issuance to an affiliate of CGFP of a ten-year warrant to purchase (for nominal consideration) 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock, which warrant was subsequently transferred to CGFP. Upon issuance of such warrant, CGFP became a person with beneficial ownership of greater than 5% of the Company’s common stock. On March 10, 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing 500,000 of the 2,500,000 shares available for purchase upon exercise of such warrant. On July 10, 2018, CGFP exercised the remaining warrant, receiving 1,999,995 shares, after surrender of shares equal in value to the nominal exercise price. In September 2011, and approximately quarterly thereafter, CGMI acted as a placement agent of asset-backed notes issued by securitization trusts sponsored by CPS. The issuances of investment-grade and below investment-grade notes, and the placement compensation to CGMI, from January 1, 2016 to the present, are set forth in the table below. In each case, one or more other placement agents also received compensation for placing such notes, as well as CGMI. On May 11, 2012, the Company entered into a one-year revolving credit agreement (the ""Citi Warehouse Agreement"") and related agreements with affiliates of Citigroup and others, under which the lenders have agreed to lend up to a maximum of $100 million, to be secured by automobile receivables. In connection with the Citi Warehouse Agreement, the Company paid a closing fee of $1,000,000. The Company first incurred indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement in the amount of $9.1 million on May 14, 2012. The Company used the proceeds of that draw for working capital. Following earlier extensions in 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2018, the Company and the lenders agreed on December 18, 2020 to extend the revolving term of the Citi Warehouse Agreement to December 18, 2022. At the conclusion of the revolving period, at the election of either the borrower or the lender, the loans are to amortize for an additional one year, and then become due in full. Loans under the Citi Warehouse Agreement bear interest during the revolving period at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.00%, but in all events no less than 3.75% per year, and during the amortization period (if any) at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.00%, but in all events no less than 4.75% per year. The loans are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default. In connection with the renewals of the Citi Warehouse Agreement in 2018 and 2020, we paid closing fees of $730,000 and $1,000,000, respectively, in each case representing a fee calculated as the product of 0.5% and the fractional number of years by which the revolving period was extended. The maximum principal amount of indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement during 2020 was $100 million. During 2020, the Company paid $197.7 million of principal and $1.4 million of interest on such debt. As of April 27, 2021, the principal amount owed was $96.8 million. The Company intends to incur additional indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement from time to time as it purchases motor vehicle receivables from dealers. CPS Leasing. The Company holds 80% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of CPS Leasing, Inc. (""CPSL""). The remaining 20% of CPSL is held by Charles E. Bradley, Jr., who is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company. CPSL engaged in the equipment leasing business, and is currently in the process of liquidation as its leases come to term. The Company financed the operations of CPSL by making operating advances and by advancing to CPSL the fraction of the purchase prices of its leased equipment that CPSL did not borrow under its lines of credit. The aggregate amounts of the advances made by the Company and outstanding to CPSL as of December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, were approximately $153,000, $122,000, and $90,000, respectively. Subordinated Notes . Director William Roberts on December 3, 2007 purchased $4,000,000 of unsecured subordinated three-year notes directly from the Company. The interest rate was determined by negotiation, and Mr. Roberts and the Company have agreed to a series of successive extensions of such indebtedness, with interest paid at 10% per annum throughout the year 2018. The Company in 2018 paid interest of $400,000 on such notes, and in 2019 paid interest of $33,333, in accordance with those terms. The Company repaid the notes in full on February 1, 2019. Policy on Related Party Transactions and Director Independence. The agreements and transactions described above, other than those described under the caption “Citigroup,” were entered into by the Company with parties who personally benefited from such transactions and who had a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company. It is the Company's policy that any such transactions with persons having a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company may take place only if approved by the Audit Committee or by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are disinterested with respect to the transaction, and independent in accordance with the standards for director independence prescribed by Nasdaq. Such policy is maintained in writing in the charter of the Audit Committee. The agreements and transactions above were reviewed and approved by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who were disinterested with respect to the transaction, except that the subordinated notes transaction was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. The seven directors of the Company are Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Chris A. Adams, Brian J. Rayhill, William B. Roberts, Gregory S. Washer, and Daniel S. Wood, of whom Messrs. Wood, Rayhill, Louis M. Grasso, and Washer compose the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that other than Mr. Bradley (who is the Company's chief executive officer), each of the other six directors is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Fees Paid to Auditors The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to the Company’s independent registered public accounting firms for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Crowe has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since February 2009, and has reported on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2020. (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Audit-related fees comprise fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements. (3) The 2019 and 2020 tax fees represent services rendered in connection with preparation of state and federal tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Audit Committee Supervision of Principal Accountant The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and permitted non-audit fees to be paid to the independent auditor, and authorizes on behalf of the Company the payment of such fees, or refuses such authorization. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman and its vice-chairman the authority to approve performance of services on an interim basis. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, all services for which audit fees or audit related fees were paid were preapproved by the Audit Committee as a whole, or pursuant to such delegated authority. In the course of its meetings, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit fees outlined above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the audit firm, and has concluded that such independence is not and was not impaired.

TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I PART II PART III PART IV PART I Item 1. Business Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our primary business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions. We also offer financing directly to sub-prime consumers to facilitate their purchase of a new or used automobile, light truck, or passenger van. In this report, we refer to all such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts"" and all such purchases or acquisitions as “originations” or “acquisitions”. We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. We consist of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “CPS” or “the Company”). From inception through December 31, 2020, we have purchased a total of approximately $17.0 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2020 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for non-affiliates. Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois branches. Most of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They may work from our Irvine branch, our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had 59 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications from 6,937 dealers in 46 states. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 77% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2020 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 2.8% of our total acquisitions and represented 2.4% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 76% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 24% consisted of financing for new cars. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 87 term securitizations of approximately $14.9 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2020, we had three such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $100 million. In February 2021, we repaid in full one of the facilities at maturity, leaving us with two facilities of $100 million each thereafter. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime, borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2020, most of our staff who work in the Irvine location were working from home, while most of our staff from our other locations were working from our offices. Other effects of the pandemic on our operations are referred to throughout this report. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency, and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we received 1.6 million applications. Approximately 68% of all applications came through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 29% via another aggregator, Route One and 3% via our website. A portion of the DealerTrack and Route One volume are applications from our pass-through arrangements with other lenders who send us applications from their dealers in cases where those lenders choose not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2020, such pass-through applications represented 15% of our total applications. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history and an alternative data credit score provided by a major credit reporting bureau. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the applicant and structure of the automobile financing contract meets our criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. In some cases where we don’t grant an approval, we may discuss with the dealer alternatives from the terms proposed or request and review further information from the dealer. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2020, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may be comprised of multiple components and which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on our purchased contracts for the periods shown: Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and by our pricing strategy. The competitive environment in 2017 and 2018 resulted in generally higher fees paid to dealers in conjunction with our contract acquisitions, compared to the years 2016 and earlier when dealers were generally paying us fees. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recalibrated our risk-based scoring and pricing model. This recalibration, and trends in the competitive environment since then, have resulted in generally higher contract interest rates and lower fees paid to dealers since that time. Paying fees to dealers increases our capital requirements for acquiring contracts. We have offered eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 75% of our new contract acquisitions in 2020, 76% in 2019, and 79% in 2018, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract if the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy their repurchase obligations to us. Contract Funding For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our funding criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. We believe that our funding criteria enable us to effectively evaluate the creditworthiness of sub-prime customers and the adequacy of the financed vehicle as security for an automobile contract. The funding criteria include standards for price, term, amount of down payment, monthly payment, and interest rate; mileage, age and type of vehicle; principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle; customer income level, employment and residence stability, credit history and debt service ability, as well as other factors. Specifically, our funding guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have more than 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 75 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our funding staff verify the customer's employment, income, residency, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open-ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign each automobile contract two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received, and the customer's credit information is retrieved from the credit reporting agencies. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including the customer's credit history, data derived from alternative sources such as utilities, telecom, and social media, length of employment, residence stability and total income. Once a vehicle is selected by the customer and a proposed deal structure is provided to us, our scores will then consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value, payment to income and the make and mileage of the vehicle. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Coronavirus Pandemic Since the onset of the pandemic and related shutdowns and interruptions to the economy, we have experienced a decrease in monthly contract purchase volumes compared to the prior year period and compared to our first quarter of 2020. Servicing and Collections We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts that are included in portfolios that we have financed in securitizations or service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; contacting obligors whose payments are late; accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; skip tracing; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. For contracts that we securitize, we are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We engage a nearshore third-party call center to supplement the efforts the collectors in our five branch locations. As of December 31, 2020, our nearshore partner had approximately 30 agents assigned to our relationship. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our risk-based assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond to our collector’s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector will attempt to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of repossessions is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts where the vehicle has been repossessed and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition, we apply a specific reserve to such contracts so that the net balance represents the estimated remaining balance after the proceeds of the sale of the vehicle are applied, net of related costs. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale, the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Contracts originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value and the economic impact of late payments is incorporated into the estimated net yield on those contracts. For contracts originated prior to January 2018, which are not accounted for at fair value, we suspend interest accruals on contracts once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent. We do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower, regardless of their stage of delinquency are first applied to outstanding accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 25 months, 23 months, and 23 months as of December 31, 2020, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession, and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we were servicing as of the respective dates shown. Delinquency and Extension Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio ___________________________ Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio _________________________ Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. During 2020 we incorporated an algorithmic extension score card which provides our staff with an objective and quantitative assessment of whether or not a obligor is a good candidate for an extension, based on the current circumstances of the account. The extension score card was developed by our internal risk management team and is derived from the post-extension performance of accounts in our managed portfolio. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2020, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2019: We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off as of December 31, 2020 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted, and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, despite the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Coronavirus Pandemic Beginning in March 2020, we experienced a significant increase in the numbers of our obligors who sought an extension because of the pandemic and related economic shutdowns. By June of 2020, the monthly volume of extensions we granted had reverted to levels at or below the prior year and have remained so through December 2020. Government mandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy has impaired and will likely continue to impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 87 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2020, 21 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining notes had a principal balance of $25.4 million. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December 2022, and adding an amortization period through December 2023. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to February 2023. In February 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date and elected not to renew it. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017 and again in December 2019, extending the revolving period to December 2021, followed by an amortization period to December 2023. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with several national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. We are subject to supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Human Capital We rely on our employees for everything we do. To make our business work, we seek to supply them with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed. In addition to new hire training, we provide mentor programs and management workshops. Workforce Allocation and Diversity We had 787 employees as of December 31, 2020 (excluding 22 on leaves of absence). Our employee population was 67% femail, and 68% self-identified as ethnically diverse (defined as all EEOC classifications other than white). Broken out by function, our human capital was allocated thus: 10 were senior management personnel; 460 were servicing personnel; 157 were automobile contract origination personnel; 96 were sales personnel and program development (59 of whom were sales representatives); 64 were various administrative personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. Compensation and benefits Our compensation policy is to be market competitive. We offer a benefits and wellness package that includes healthcare coverage, defined contribution retirement benefits, and other components. Employee Engagement Our means of evaluating our human capital resources include, on an individual basis, annual performance reviews, and, on an aggregate basis, a confidential biennial employee climate survey. The survey results are reviewed by senior management and used to assist in reviewing our human capital strategies, programs, and practices. Other metrics used in human capital management include average employee tenure and annual turnover rate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2021; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the nine fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. Our business strategy requires that warehouse credit facilities be available in order to purchase significant volumes of receivables. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $100 million. Both warehouse credit facilities have a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. If we are unable to maintain warehouse financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. We experienced improvements in the capital markets from 2010 through 2019 during which time we completed 36 securitizations. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020., if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we could expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such higher than expected losses occurred in 2008 through 2010, which had an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Should significant increases in losses reoccur, such recurrence might have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If We Are Unable to Obtain Credit Enhancement for Our Securitizations Upon Favorable Terms, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. In our securitizations from 1994 through 2008, we utilized credit enhancement in the form of one or more financial guaranty insurance policies issued by financial guaranty insurance companies. Each of these policies unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed timely interest and ultimate principal payments on the senior classes of the securities issued in those securitizations. These guarantees enabled those securities to achieve the highest credit rating available. This form of credit enhancement reduced the costs of our securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancement available to us at the time. Due to significantly reduced investor demand for securities carrying such a financial guaranty, this form of credit enhancement may not be economical for us in the future. The 38 securitization transactions we executed from 2010 through 2020 did not utilize financial guaranty insurance policies. Prior to the second quarter of 2014, none of the securities issued in those transactions received the highest possible credit rating from any rating agency. As we pursue future securitizations, we may not be able to obtain: The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. As of the date of this report, it is the consensus of market observers that interest rates on risk-free debt will rise within the next year. If interest rates on risk-free debt do increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, which would adversely affect our results of operations. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. For our receivables originated prior to January 2018, we maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated.. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Receivables originated since January 2018 are recorded at fair value and incorporate estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a fair value adjustment to those receivables or reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., our President and CEO, has been our President since our formation in 1991. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at their own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC has conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. Our industry has also been under investigation by the United States Department of Justice, which has conducted and may continue to conduct an inquiry that appears to be focused on securitization practices. In that inquiry, we received a subpoena in January 2015, which required that we produce specified documents. We were subsequently advised by the Department of Justice that we have provided such information as is required, and that no enforcement action against us is recommended. Although the inquiry commenced January 2015 is thus completed as to us, no assurance can be given as to whether some other government agency may commence inquiries into or actions against us, nor as to whether the DOJ may recommence its investigation, any of which hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. The Dodd-Frank Act, adopted in 2010, made numerous changes to the laws applicable to the consumer financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products and mandated that other federal agencies adopt rules implementing risk retention requirements in securitizations. We are also subject to regulation by each state in which we operate, and such states’ laws and regulations, and the interpretations thereof, also change from time to time. Compliance with new laws and regulations may be or likely will be costly and can affect operating results. Compliance requires forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables after December 2016 are subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Similar but not identical risk retention requirements are applicable after December 2018 to securitization transactions where purchasers of the ABS have sufficient contacts with the European Union. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage in our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the FTC, the CFPB and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We Have Substantial Indebtedness. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,969.4 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $1,803.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $119.0 million of warehouse lines of credit, $25.4 million of residual interest financing debt and $21.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the recorded value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous recorded value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Recorded Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Recorded Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our recorded value, we might be required to adjust the recorded value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in recorded value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors The Coronavirus Outbreak Could Have Adverse Effects The COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, including the United States, and has been declared a public health emergency. Various governments have also made emergency declarations related to the COVID-19 virus (alternately, “the pandemic”) and have attempted to slow community spread of the virus by providing social distancing guidelines, including issuing orders to suspend involuntary repossession activities, issuing stay-at-home or quarantine orders and mandating the closure of certain non-essential businesses. The pandemic has had adverse effects on the economy of the United States (which include a significant increase in unemployment) and the global economy in general. The long-term effects of the social, economic and financial disruptions caused by the pandemic are unknown. The United States economy contracted in the first quarter of 2020, and entered into a recession in the second quarter with a virtually unprecedented further sharp decline in GDP. Economic growth in the remainder of 2020 was insufficient to restore GDP to the level achieved prior to the outbreak, and there can be no assurance as to the future course of the economy in general or of the market for motor vehicles in particular. Caution on the part of vehicle purchasers, and possibly other factors, have led to a reduction in purchases of motor vehicles. Such reduction, combined with caution on our part in extension of credit, has resulted in a significant decline in its origination of automobile contracts, beginning in April of 2020, and continuing through the present. The extent to which obligors may be adversely affected by the outbreak, by loss of employment, and by related efforts of governments to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus throughout the nation and world cannot be predicted. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the ability of obligors to make timely payments to us. Stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits made available to much of the population may have ameliorated in part the adverse effects on us of the pandemic. Although additional payments and additional enhanced benefits may be authorized, there can be no assurance as to their continuation. Obligors’ use of the stimulus payments, and termination of such enhanced benefits, may have an adverse effect on our receipt of payments from obligors in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the continued spread of the COVID-19 virus may result in staffing problems in various industries and with businesses and third-party suppliers as portions of the workforce across the industry are unable to work effectively as a result of the pandemic, including because of illness, facility closures, ineffective remote work arrangements or technology failures or limitations. Our ability to service automobile contracts could be diminished by regulatory action related to the pandemic and by disruptions in the economy and in financial markets. Finally, and depending on the extent to which the pandemic adversely affects the United States economy, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, such as those related to our business or operations, the ability or willingness of our customers to make timely payments, and risks of geographic concentrations. If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Effect of Social, Economic and Other Factors on Losses The ability of our customers to make payments on automobile contracts will be affected by a variety of social and economic factors, most notably the extent to which our customers remain gainfully employed. Other economic factors include interest rates, general unemployment levels, the rate of inflation, adjustments in monthly mortgage payments and consumer perceptions of economic conditions generally and the effect of government stimulus programs and consumer protection/payment relief efforts implemented in connection with the COVID-19 virus. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels, consumer attitudes toward bankruptcy and the repayment of indebtedness and consumer perceptions of political events and shifts, which may be affected by the pandemic. We are generally unable to determine whether or to what extent economic or social factors will affect the performance of our portfolio of automobile contracts, but caution that a recession or depression in local, regional or national economies would be expected to increase delinquencies and losses, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 5.6 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 25%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.7 million, increasing to approximately $1.8 million through 2023. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 129,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $4.3 million, increasing to approximately $4.5 million through 2022. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Lombard, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2021 to 2025. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.4 million. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation . We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Wage and Hour Claim . On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In General . There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2020, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above, and consumer claims. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2020 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2020 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2020, we have originated a total of approximately $17.0 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2020 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for non-affiliates. Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” In March 2020 at the outset of the pandemic we complied with government mandated shutdown orders in the five locations we operate by arranging for many of our staff to work from home and invoking various safety protocols for workers who remained in our offices. In April 2020, we laid off approximately 100 workers, or about 10% of our workforce, throughout our offices because of significant reductions in new contract originations. As of December 31, 2020, most of our staff who work in the Irvine location were working from home, while most of our staff from our other locations were working from our offices. The pandemic itself, if sufficient numbers of people were to be afflicted, could cause obligors under our automobile contracts to be unable to pay their contractual obligations. As the future course of the COVID-19 pandemic is as yet unknown, its direct effect on future obligor payments is likewise uncertain. The mandatory shutdown of large portions of the United States economy pursuant to emergency restrictions has impaired and will impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to pay their contractual obligations. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. Other effects of the pandemic on our operations is referred to throughout this report. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 87 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2020, 21 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $200 million, comprising two credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in December 2020, extending the revolving period to December 2022, with an optional amortization period through December 2023. In November 2015, we entered into another $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017 and again in December 2019, extending the revolving period to December 2021, followed by an amortization period to December 2023. We previously had a third $100 million facility. This facility was established in April 2015 and was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021. We repaid this facility in full at its maturity in 2021. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. In a securitization, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Amortization of Deferred Origination Costs and Acquisition Fees, (d) Term Securitizations, (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and incremental losses gradually increasing to a peak around 18 months, after which they gradually decrease. The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduced a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. At the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Government mandated shutdowns of large portions of the United States economy impaired and will likely continue to impair the ability of obligors under our automobile contracts to make their monthly payments. The extent to which that ability will be impaired, and the extent to which public ameliorative measures such as stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits may restore such ability, cannot be estimated. During the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, we supplemented our allowance for finance credit losses by $14.1 million to provide for additional losses that we may incur due to the pandemic. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recoded value, an adjustment would be required. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020, the Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $29.5 million. The mark down is reflected as a reduction in revenue. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( "" spread account "" ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2020, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2020, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 87 term securitizations of approximately $15.1 billion in contracts. We generally conduct our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the beginning of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, we completed only three securitizations in 2020. In April 2020 we postponed our planned securitization due to the onset of the pandemic and the effective closure of the capital markets in which our securitizations are executed. Subsequently we successfully completed securitizations in June and September 2020. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 with the year ended December 31, 2019 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2020, our revenues were $271.2 million, a decrease of $74.6 million, or 21.6%, from the prior year revenues of $345.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income and a mark down to the recorded value of the portion of the receivables portfolio accounted for at fair value. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $42.1 million, or 12.5%, to $295.0 million from $337.1 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the continued runoff of our portfolio of finance receivables originated prior to January 2018, which accrued interest at an average of 18.5%, which is offset only in part by the increase in our portfolio of receivables measured at fair value, which are those originated since January 2018. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $29.5 million mark down to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. The mark down is an estimate based on our evaluation of the appropriate fair value and future earnings rate of existing receivables compared to recently acquired receivables and our assessment of potential additional future net losses arising from the pandemic. Other income decreased by $3.0 million, or 34.4%, to $5.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.7 million in the prior year. The decrease in other income generally resulted from a decrease of $1.3 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers and a decrease of $1.0 million in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $251.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $336.6 million for the prior year, a decrease of $85.6 million, or 25.4%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses and interest expense. Employee costs decreased by $679,000 or 0.8%, to $80.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, representing 31.9% of total operating expenses, from $80.9 million for the prior year, or 24.0% of total operating expenses. In the first quarter of 2020, prior to the onset of the pandemic, our employee costs were greater than in the first quarter of 2019. Those increases have been partially offset by decreases since the first quarter of 2020, which are the result of staff reductions due in part to the fact that our contract purchases have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. If our contract purchase volumes remain at current levels, we expect lower employee costs in future periods. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2020 and 2019: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $32.0 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to the previous year and represented 12.7% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $9.2 million to $101.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to $110.5 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 40.4% of total operating expenses in 2020. Interest on securitization trust debt decreased by $8.8 million, or 9.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 7.5% to $2,017.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The blended interest rates on new term securitizations have generally increased in 2017 and 2018 before declining in 2019 and 2020. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing to accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in fluctuations in our securitization trust debt interest costs. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $724,000, or 8.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average rate on the debt was 8.3% in 2020 compared to 9.7% in the prior year while the average balance of the warehouse debt increased to $92.5 million from $86.2 million. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $3.8 million in the prior year as the average balance has decreased. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes increased by $741,000, or 51.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes increased from $15.0 million in the prior year to $19.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 11.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: ___________________ The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,631.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,212.2 million in the prior year period. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss model, generally referred to as CECL. Adoption of CECL required the establishment of an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio that was originated prior to January 2018. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. Provision for credit losses was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The provision represents our estimate of additional losses that may be incurred on the portfolio of finance receivables resulting from the pandemic. Such losses were not considered in our initial estimate of remaining lifetime losses that we recorded with the adoption of CECL in January 2020. In the prior year period, prior to the adoption of CECL, provision for credit losses was $85.8 million. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expense consists primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expense decreased by $3.7 million to $14.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 and represented 5.7% of total operating expenses. We purchased $742.6 million of new contracts during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1,002.8 million in the prior year period. In our second quarter of 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in contract purchases due to the pandemic and partial shutdown of the economy. Subsequently, our contract purchase volumes have increased but have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Occupancy expenses decreased by $66,000 or 0.9%, to $7.4 million compared to $7.5 million in the previous year and represented 3.0% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $709,000 or 65.9%, to $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million in the previous year and represented 0.6% of total operating expenses. Income tax benefit was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which includes an $8.8 million tax benefit. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was passed into law, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the CARES Act provides for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $8.8 million. Excluding the tax benefit, income tax expense would have been $7.2 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 36%. For the prior year period, income tax expense was $3.8 million, which represents an effective income tax rate of 41%. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were $345.8 million, a decrease of $44.0 million, or 11.3%, from the prior year revenues of $389.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $43.2 million, or 11.4%, to $337.1 million from $380.3 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Other income decreased by $730,000, or 7.2%, to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $10.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decrease of $1.2 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $740,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $371.1 million for the prior year, a decrease of $34.4 million, or 9.3%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in interest expense, employee costs, and general and administrative expenses. Employee costs increased by $1.6 million or 2.0%, to $80.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 24.0% of total operating expenses, from $79.3 million for the prior year, or 24.5% of total operating expenses. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2019 and 2018: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $33.0 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 6.3%, compared to the previous year and represented 9.8% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $9.1 million to $110.5 million, or 8.9%, compared to $101.5 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 32.8% of total operating expenses in 2019. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.9 million, or 7.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt increased 1.9% to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 also increased to 4.4% from 4.2% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. The cost of funds had moved up in 2018 before trending downward in 2019. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.2% in the prior year. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes decreased by $11,000, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes decreased from $16.5 million in the prior year to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, the average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 million in the prior year. This transaction closed in May 2018 and was not outstanding for the full year in 2018. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit increased by $650,000, or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due to the higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 11.6% in 2018 to 9.7% in 2019. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: _______________________ (1) Average balances are based on month end balances except for warehouse lines of credit, which are based on daily balances. (2) Net of deferred fees and direct costs. (3) Net interest income divided by average interest earning assets. The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,212.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $447.2 million in the prior year period. Provision for credit losses was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $47.3 million, or 35.5% compared to the prior year and represented 25.5% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowance requires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables. In addition, we monitor the delinquency and net charge off rates in our portfolio to consider how such rates may affect the allowance for finance credit losses. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Since no receivables have been added to the legacy portfolio since December 2017, it has seasoned to the point where its weighted age is 42 months at December 31, 2019. We have also observed that receivables originated in 2017 have incurred credit losses at a significantly lower rate than receivables we originated in 2015 and 2016. The age of the legacy portfolio, its continuously declining balance and the significant variance of the relative credit performance of the vintage pools that make up the legacy portfolio have contributed to lower provisions for credit losses and lower levels of the allowance for finance credit losses. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income under the interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expenses increased by $321,000, or 1.8%, to $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $17.6 million in the prior year, and represented 5.3% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased 55,919 contracts representing $1,002.8 million in receivables compared to 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables in the prior year. Occupancy expenses decreased by $120,000 or 1.6%, to $7.5 million compared to $7.6 million in the previous year and represented 2.2% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $84,000 or 8.5%, to $1,076,000 compared to $992,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 41.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes $2.1 million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of the tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $238.8 million, $216.8 million and $216.2 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $93.0 million. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $229.4 million and $242.2 million, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $739.7 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $1,004.2 million and $914.9 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $328.5 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $23.3 million and $31.4 million, respectively. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $714.5 million in new securitization trust debt in 2020 compared to $1,000.5 million in 2019 and $855.8 million in 2018. Repayments of securitization debt were $1,010.0 million, $966.1 million and $876.1 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrestricted cash of $13.5 million and $179.5 million aggregate available borrowings under our three warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 30, 2020, we had approximately $33.5 million of such eligible collateral. In February 2021, we repaid in full one of the facilities at maturity, leaving us with two facilities of $100 million each thereafter. During 2020, we completed three securitizations aggregating $714.5 million of notes sold. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. Our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. We have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,969.4 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $1,803.7 million of securitization trust debt and $119.0 million of debt from warehouse lines of credit. Since 2005, we have offered renewable subordinated notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. We had $21.3 million in subordinated renewable notes outstanding at December 31, 2020. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. At December 31, 2020, $25.6 million of this residual interest financing debt remains outstanding ($25.4 million net of deferred financing costs). Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands): _____________________ We anticipate repaying debt due in 2021 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 82.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In December 2020, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2022 and to include an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $45.7 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in April 2015. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023. At December 31, 2020 there was $42.6 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date and elected not to renew it. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $32.3 million outstanding under this facility. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2020, $25.6 million of residual interest financing debt remains outstanding. This amount does not exclude $150,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our consolidated balance sheets. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 37 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $1,803.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2020 there were $21.3 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as ""anticipates,"" ""expects,"" ""plans,"" ""estimates,"" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include unexpected exogenous events, such as a widespread plague that might affect the ability or willingness of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; mandates imposed in reaction to such events, such as prohibitions of otherwise permissible activity, which might impair the obligation to perform contracts, or the abilty of obligors to earn; changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts; changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts; and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This report includes Consolidated Financial Statements, notes thereto and an Independent Auditors’ Report, at the pages indicated below, in the "" Index to Financial Statements. "" Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "" Exchange Act "" ) as of December 31, 2020 (the "" Evaluation Date "" ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report. Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

ADAMS March 10, 2021 /s/ BRIAN J. RAYHILL March 10, 2021 /s/ WILLIAM B. ROBERTS March 10, 2021 /s/ GREGORY S. WASHER March 10, 2021 /s/ DANIEL S. WOOD March 10, 2021 /s/ JEFFREY P. FRITZ Jeffrey P. Fritz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Las Vegas, Nevada Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Explanatory Paragraph - Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (ASC 326). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles. The adoption of the new credit loss standard and its subsequent application is also communicated as a critical audit matter below. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Accounting for Loans at Fair Value As described in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company carries all finance receivables acquired after 2017 at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company had $1.5 billion in finance receivables that are carried at fair value, all of which are classified as level 3 fair values as they contain one or more inputs which are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. With assistance from a third party, the Company used a discounted cash flow model to measure the fair value of finance receivables. The significant assumptions used by the Company to estimate cash flows and calculate the fair value of these financial receivables include volatility relating to expected loss rates, timing of losses and market-based discount rates. These significant assumptions were based on market data, the Company's industry experience, and the Company’s expectations based on results of historical loan cohorts. Historical loan cohorts are pools of loans that are originated in the same month, the Company assesses performance of each individual cohort when assessing fair value. We identified the valuation of finance receivables carried at fair value as a critical audit matter as this estimate requires subjective auditor judgment. Our principal considerations in making this determination are (i) there was significant judgment and estimation by the Company in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to the fair value of these finance receivables, and (ii) the audit effort involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Our primary audit procedures to address this critical audit matter included: Allowance for Finance Credit Losses – CECL Adoption and Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2020 the company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 Financial instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments for its finance receivables acquired prior to 2018 (referred to as the legacy portfolio). Upon adoption, the Company recorded a decrease to retained earnings of $92 million (see change in accounting principle explanatory paragraph above). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has a gross receivables portfolio of $492.1 million and a related allowance for finance credit losses (ACL) on loans of $80.8 million and provision for credit losses of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management estimates the allowance using relevant information from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on the calendar quarter of origination is used to estimate expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. This estimate is adjusted by certain qualitative factors that may impact future credit losses. The qualitative adjustment factors represent management’s estimate of the impact of the pandemic on future losses. The use of qualitative factors to estimate pandemic related losses requires significant judgment. Management applies qualitative factors to adjust its estimation of the timing and amount losses to represent its future economic forecast. We identified auditing the reasonableness of forecasts in its credit loss model as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included: /s/ CROWE LLP Dallas, Texas March 10, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. ( "" CPS "" ) was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "" Company "" ) specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ( "" Contracts "" ) originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers ( "" Dealers "" ) located throughout the United States. Dealers located in California, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, and Texas represented 13.5 %, 11.1 %, 5.4 %, 5.3 % and 5.1 %, respectively, of contracts purchased during 2020 compared with 12.6 %, 10.8 %, 6.3 %, 5.4 % and 4.2 % respectively in 2019. No other state had a concentration in excess of 5.1% in 2020. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80 % owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2020, our unrestricted cash balance was $ 13.5 million, which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the recorded value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the recorded value, an adjustment would be required. For the period ended December 31, 2020, the Company considered the effect of the pandemic on the portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value and recorded a mark down to that portfolio of $ 29.5 million. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial recorded value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for current expected credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the recorded value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $ 3.8 million and $ 7.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Treatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "" overcollateralization "" of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The majority of the Company’s revenues come from interest income which is outside the scope of ASC 606. The Company’s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within Other Income and are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies its obligation to the customer. Services within the scope of ASC 606 include revenue associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. Earnings Per Share Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the related period. The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Incremental shares of 13.6 million, 11.3 million and 10.3 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation , that generally requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of stock options, restricted stock or other equity instruments, based on the grant date fair value of those awards. Compensation cost is recognized for awards issued to employees based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options. This cost is recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, generally the vesting period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These are material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2020 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2020, which represents our estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"")Topic 326, which changes the criteria under which credit losses on financial instruments (such as the Company’s finance receivables) are measured. ASC 326 introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology previously used under U.S. GAAP with a methodology that records currently the expected lifetime credit losses on financial instruments. To establish such lifetime credit loss estimates, consideration of a broadened range of reasonable and supportable information to establish credit loss estimates is required. ASC 326 was initially scheduled to become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, however on October 16, 2019, the FASB changed the effective date for smaller reporting companies to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the CECL model. The adoption of CECL required that we establish an allowance for the remaining expected lifetime credit losses on the portion of the Company’s receivable portfolio for which the Company was not already using fair value accounting. We refer to that portion, which is those receivables that were originated prior to January 2018, as our “legacy portfolio”. To comply with CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method, and not a current period expense. Coronavirus Pandemic In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (the “COVID-19 virus”) originated in Wuhan, China. Since its discovery, the COVID-19 virus has spread throughout the world, and the outbreak has been declared to be a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We refer from time to time in this report to the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 virus as “the pandemic.” CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Results for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the estimated potential effect on credit performance resulting from the pandemic. We recorded a $14.1 14,113 million charge to the provision for credit losses for the legacy portfolio accounted for under CECL and a $29.5 million mark down to the recorded value of the finance receivables measured at fair value. We measure our portfolio of finance receivables carried at fair value with consideration for unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio. The pandemic and the adverse effect it may have on the U.S. economy and our obligors may cause us to consider s ignificant changes in any of those inputs, which in turn may have a significant effect on our fair value measurement. (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $ 130.7 million and $ 135.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $ 52.2 million and $ 54.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key terms such as interest rate, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: Finance receivables totaling $5.4 5,400 million and $31.4 31,400 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. Allowance for Credit Losses – Finance Receivables The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of finance receivables to present the net amount expected to be collected. Charge offs are deducted from the allowance when management believes that collectability is unlikely. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and, reasonable and supportable forecasts. We believe our historical credit loss experience provides the best basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Consequently, we use historical loss experience for older receivables, aggregated into vintage pools based on their calendar quarter of origination, to forecast expected losses for less seasoned quarterly vintage pools. We measure the weighted average monthly incremental change in cumulative net losses for the vintage pools in the relevant historical period. For the pools in the relevant historical period, we consider each pool’s performance from its inception through the end of the current period. We then apply the results of the historical analysis to less seasoned vintage pools beginning with each vintage pool’s most recent actual cumulative net loss experience and extrapolating from that point based on the historical data. We believe the pattern and magnitude of losses on older vintages allows us to establish a reasonable and supportable forecast of less seasoned vintages. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. For key credit characteristics of individual contracts such as obligor credit history, job stability, residence stability and ability to pay, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Similarly, for key structural characteristics such as loan-to-value, length of contract, monthly payment and amount financed, there is relatively little variation from the average for the portfolio. Consequently, we do not believe there are significant differences in risk characteristics between various segments of our portfolio. Our methodology incorporates historical pools that are sufficiently seasoned to capture the magnitude and trends of losses within those vintage pools. Furthermore, the historical period encompasses a substantial volume of receivables over periods that include fluctuations in the competitive landscape, the Company’s rates of growth, size of our managed portfolio and fluctuations in economic growth and unemployment. In consideration of the depth and breadth of the historical period, and the homogeneity of our portfolio, we generally do not adjust historical loss information for differences in risk characteristics such as credit or structural composition of segments of the portfolio or for changes in environmental conditions such as changes in unemployment rates, collateral values or other factors. Throughout our history we have observed how events such as extreme weather, political unrest, and other qualitative factors have influenced the performance of our portfolio. Consequently, we have considered how such qualitative factors may affect future credit losses and have incorporated our judgement of the effect of those factors into our estimates. The following table presents the amortized cost basis of our finance receivables by annual vintage as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: At the adoption of CECL, the Company recorded an addition to its allowance for finance credit losses of $127.0 million. In accordance with the rules for adopting CECL, the offset to the addition to the allowance for finance credit losses was a tax affected reduction to retained earnings using the modified retrospective method. In consideration of the uncertainty associated with the pandemic, the Company made additional provisions for credit losses on finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020 in the amount of $14.1 million. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $ 1,784,000 , $ 1,076,000 , and $ 992,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were $ 2.2 million in equipment disposals during the year ended December 31, 2020. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (5) Securitization Trust Debt We have completed numerous term securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these transactions is shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Securitization trust debt,” and the components of such debt are summarized in the following table: Final Scheduled Payment Date (1) Receivables Pledged at December 31, 2020 (2) Initial Principal Outstanding Principal at December 31, 2020 Outstanding Principal at December 31, 2019 Weighted Average Contractual Interest Rate at December 31, 2020 _________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $ 10.6 million and $ 12.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2020. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2020, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $ 130.7 million. Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are summarized below: Debt issuance costs of $ 1.5 million and $ 2.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 83.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In December 2020, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2022 and to include an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $ 45.7 million outstanding under this facility. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $ 42.6 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2021, we repaid this facility in full at its maturity date. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $ 100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2020 there was $ 32.3 million outstanding under this facility. The total outstanding debt on our three warehouse lines of credit was $ 120.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $ 136.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2019. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $ 40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. At December 31, 2020 there was $ 25.6 million outstanding under this facility. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 150,000 have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of long term debt as of December 31, 2020: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2020, we purchased 351,926 shares of our common stock at an average price of $ 3.45 . In October 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $ 10 million of our common stock. There is approximately $ 5.1 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015 and again in July 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000 and 19,200,000 , respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 1.33 , $ 1.11 and $ 1.06 , respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 72 % to 80 % for 2020, 37 % to 39 % for 2019, and 31 % to 34 % for 2018. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $1.9 1,935 million, $2.1 2,072 million and $3.5 3,515 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $ 3.2 million. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $ 11.9 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $ 8.2 million and $ 4.8 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 1.0 million and $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2020 and cash of $ 949,000 was received. At December 31, 2020, there were a total of 270,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act was adopted, providing wide ranging economic relief for individuals and businesses. One component of the CARES Act provides the Company with an opportunity to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) arising from 2018, 2019 and 2020 to the prior five tax years. The Company has such NOLs reflected on its balance sheet as a portion of deferred tax assets. The Company has previously valued its NOLs at the federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. However, the provisions of the CARES Act provide for NOL carryback claims to be calculated based on a rate of 35%, which was the federal corporate tax rate in effect for the carryback years. Consequently, the Company has revalued the benefit from its NOLs to reflect a 35 % tax rate. The result of the revaluation of NOLs and other tax adjustments is a net tax benefit of $ 8.8 million, which is reflected in income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million 3,841 which include a $ 2.1 million net tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Without the benefit, income tax expense for 2018 would have been $5.9 million. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $28.5 million 28,512 as of December 31, 2020 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $28.5 million consists of approximately $ 17.0 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $ 11.5 million of net state deferred tax assets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $ 86.8 million. These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2020, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2017. (10) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, equipment, software and hardware. The Company has entered into operating leases for the majority of its real estate locations, primarily office space. These leases are generally for periods of three to seven years with various renewal options. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine if a contract contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the leases expense included in Occupancy, General and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: The following table presents the supplemental cash flow information related to leases: Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2020, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including the matters identified above, and consumer claims. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2020 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or identified above, as of December 31, 2020 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (11) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $ 1.4 million, $ 1.6 million, and $ 1.5 respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2020 and 2019: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25 % per annum as of December 31, 2020. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2020 is $ 148,000 . The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by asset category, is as follows: ________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (12) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2020, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $15.6 million 15,589 . We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $11.8 million, 11,790 which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 24 % , resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $3.8 3,799 million. The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2019 was $7.5 million 7,544 after applying a valuation adjustment of $21.4 million 21,389 . CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2020 and 2019. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (13) Subsequent Events On January 27, 2021 we executed our first securitization of 2021. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $230.5 million of asset-backed notes secured by $245.0 million in automobile receivables originated by CPS. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2021-A, consist of five classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Standard & Poor’s and DBRS Morningstar, and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and CPS’s experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 1.11%. The 2021-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance and overcollateralization of 5.90%. The transaction agreements require accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 9.30% of the original receivable pool balance, or 32.05% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction utilizes a pre-funding structure, in which CPS sold approximately $184.4 million of receivables at inception approximately $60.6 million of additional receivables in February 2021. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. ",0000889609,CPSS

Because no financial statements are included in this Amendment and this Amendment does not contain or amend any disclosures with respect to Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the certifications have been omitted. This Amendment does not include the certifications under Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 because no financial statements are included in this Amendment. Except as stated herein, this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the 2019 Form 10-K with the SEC on March 16, 2020 and no attempt has been made in this Amendment to modify or update other disclosures contained in the 2019 Form 10-K.

Executive Officers The information regarding the Company’s executive officers set forth in Part I of this report under the caption “Executive Officers of the Registrant” is incorporated herein by reference. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Directors, executive officers and holders of in excess of 10% of the Company's common stock are required to file reports concerning their transactions in and holdings of equity securities of the Company. Based on a review of reports filed by each such person, and inquiry of each regarding holdings and transactions, the Company believes that all reports required with respect to the year 2019 were timely filed, except that the initial report of our newly-elected director, Mr. Grasso, which reported holdings of zero, was filed late. Code of Ethics The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, controller and others. A copy of the Code of Ethics may be obtained at no charge by written request to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices. Audit and Other Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating Committee. Each of these three committees operates under a written charter, adopted by the Board of Directors. The charters are available on the Company’s website, www.consumerportfolio.com/charters.html . The Board of Directors has concluded that each member of these three committees (every director other than Mr. Bradley, the Company's chief executive officer), is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them have a material relationship with the Company that would impair their independence from management or otherwise compromise the ability to act as an independent director. The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Wood (chairman), Mr. Rayhill and Mr. Washer. The Audit Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to review the financial books and records of the Company in consultation with the Company's accounting and auditing staff and its independent auditors and to review with the accounting staff and independent auditors any questions that may arise with respect to accounting and auditing policy and procedure. The Board of Directors has further determined that Mr. Wood has the qualifications and experience necessary to serve as an ""audit committee financial expert"" as such term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Mr. Wood, as president of Carclo Technical Plastics, was responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the audited financial statements of that company. Item 11. Executive Compensation. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee directors Chris Adams (chairman), William Roberts and Daniel Wood. From December 2007 through January 2019, Mr. Roberts held $4,000,000 of subordinated notes issued by the Company. The board of directors considered whether such holdings would reasonably be expected to impair Mr. Roberts’ exercise of independent judgment, and concluded that his independence was not impaired. In coming to that conclusion, the board noted that the Company’s repayment obligation was subordinated to all other debt of the Company, creating a near-alignment of interest with the holders of common stock, and also noted Mr. Roberts’ substantial beneficial ownership of Company common stock. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this report. Based on such review and discussions and relying thereon, we have recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Chris A. Adams (chairman) William B. Roberts Daniel S. Wood Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2019 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Outcome The Compensation Committee annually considers the results of the most recent advisory vote by shareholders to approve executive officer compensation. In the 2019 advisory vote, a majority of the voted shares (56%) approved the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee has noted the substantial negative vote, but has determined to retain the existing design, purposes and structure of our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive officer compensation in its future administration of executive compensation. Compensation Objectives The Company's objectives with respect to compensation are several. The significant objectives are to cause compensation (i) to be sufficient in total amount to provide reasonable assurance of retaining key executives, (ii) to include a significant contingent component, so as to provide strong incentives to meet designated Company objectives, and (iii) to include a significant component tied to the price of the Common Stock, so as to align management's incentives with shareholder interests. The compensation committee (""Committee"") of the Company's Board of Directors is charged with administering the Company’s compensation plans to meet those objectives. To the extent that elements of compensation would not advance such objectives, or would do so less effectively than would other elements, the Committee seeks to avoid paying compensation in those forms. Role of the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer Our Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, to make all decisions regarding executive compensation, including administration of our compensation plans. In that regard, the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is authorized to form subcommittee(s) and to retain experts and consultants to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. To date it has not done so. The chief executive officer, who attends meetings of the Compensation Committee by invitation of the Committee’s chairman, assists the Committee in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by, among other things: The other executive officers do not have a role in determining their own compensation, other than to discuss their annual individual performance objectives and results achieved with the chief executive officer. Our Overall Approach The Committee has put into place a compensation system consisting of three key components: base salary, an annual cash bonus pursuant to an incentive plan, and long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options. The table below provides comparative information regarding the components of our year 2019 executive compensation program. We are applying the same elements in our executive compensation program for the year 2020. The Committee has from time to time considered providing additional elements of executive compensation. It has considered elements such as restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, compensation contingent on a change in control, defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation, and supplemental retirement plans (supplemental in the sense that they exceed the limits for tax advantaged treatment). To date, the Committee has elected not to pay compensation in such forms, having determined that the Company's objectives are better met by one or more of the elements of compensation that it does pay. Regarding restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Committee has noted that any form of equity equivalent to or closely tied to common stock does serve to meet the objective of aligning officers' personal interest with that of the shareholders generally. The Committee believes, however, that the objective is better met by grants of stock options than by grants of share equivalents, because recipients of the grants will face the same degree of variance in results at a lesser cost to the Company, when option grants are compared to grants of restricted stock units. Further, unlike restricted stock, option grants will not provide a reward to the holder absent an improvement over time in the Company’s stock price. The committee has elected not to provide material perquisites as compensation, having determined that cash is a better medium of exchange. Regarding compensation that would be payable contingent on a change in control of the Company, the Committee believes that there are certain legitimate objectives to be met by such contingent compensation. As of the date of this proxy statement, however, no such contingent compensation plans are in place. Regarding defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation and supplemental retirement plans, the Committee believes that the Company's retention objective is better met by straight cash payments, whether in the form of base salary or in the form of bonus compensation. In particular with respect to plans for deferred compensation, the Committee believes those make sense for the Company and for the recipient only on the basis of assumptions regarding future tax rates payable by each. Having no assurance that such assumptions would be correct, the Committee has chosen not to put into place any special deferred compensation programs for the company’s executive officers. Those officers do participate in a company-sponsored tax-deferred savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, on the same terms available to company employees generally. The Committee may in the future revisit its conclusions as to any of the components discussed above, or may consider other forms of compensation. The Base Salary Element With respect to the retention objective, the Committee considers an executive's base salary to be the most critical component. Acting primarily on the basis of recommendations of the chief executive officer, the Committee determines whether to adjust other officers' base salaries annually, with typical adjustments ranging from zero (applicable to most of the Company’s executive officers from 2017 to the present) to as much as a 10% increase from the prior year's rate. Where exceptional circumstances apply, such as recruitment of a new executive officer, a promotion to executive officer status or a special need to retain an individual officer, the chief executive officer may recommend, and the Committee may approve, a larger increase. The Company's general approach in setting the annual compensation of its named executive officers is to set those officers’ base compensation by reference to their base rates for the preceding year. During the year ended December 2019, the Company's chief executive officer, Charles E. Bradley, Jr., received $995,000 in base salary. In setting that rate in the first quarter of 2019, the Committee considered the base salary rate that the Company had paid in the prior year ($995,000), the desirability of ensuring retention of the services of the Company's incumbent chief executive officer, the Company’s financial performance, and the levels of chief executive officer compensation prevailing among other financial services companies. The Committee considered whether to adjust officers’ base compensation for 2019, and determined not to increase the base rate for the chief executive officer or the other named executive officers. The Annual Incentive Bonus (EMB) element To encourage executive officers and key management personnel to exercise their best efforts and management skills toward causing the Company to meet its overall objective, and toward achieving designated specific individual objectives, the Company has implemented an Executive Management Bonus Plan, with annual payouts. Under the Company's bonus plan as applied to the year ended December 2019, the Company’s two executive vice presidents (each of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 160% of their base salaries, and the Company’s senior vice presidents (two of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 120% of their base salaries. The chief executive officer was eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 600% of his base salary. The implementation of this element for the year 2019 is discussed below. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Element The Committee also awards incentive and non-qualified stock options under the Company's stock option plans. Such awards are designed to assist in the retention of key executives and management personnel and to create an incentive to create shareholder value over a sustained period of time. The Company believes that stock options are a valuable tool in compensating and retaining employees. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Committee granted stock options to the Company's executive officers. All such grants were awarded in August 2019, and all carry exercise prices equal to the market price for the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The terms of such options are described below, under the caption ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year."" The numbers of shares made subject to each of the option grants were based on various factors relating to the responsibilities of the individual officers and to the extent of previous grants to such individuals. Because the exercise price of all options granted is equal to or above the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, the option holders may realize value only if the stock price appreciates from the price on the date the options were granted. This design is intended to focus executives on the enhancement of shareholder value over the long term. Other Elements The Company also maintains certain broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical and dental insurance, and a qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k) plan), in which executive officers are permitted to participate. Such officers participate on the same terms as non-executive personnel who meet applicable eligibility criteria, and are subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the benefits that may be payable under the plans. The Company does not maintain any form of defined benefit pension or retirement plan in which executive officers may participate, nor does it maintain any form of supplemental retirement savings or supplemental deferred compensation plan. Exercise of Discretion In exercising its discretion as to the level of executive compensation and its components, the Committee considers a number of factors. Members of the Committee conduct informal surveys of compensation paid to comparable executives within and without the consumer finance industry. The Committee finds these data useful primarily in evaluating the overall level of compensation paid or to be paid to the Company's executive officers. The Committee noted that the Company met and exceeded its budget objectives for the year. Operational factors considered included individual and group management goals; indicators of the performance and credit quality of the Company's servicing portfolio, including levels of delinquencies and charge-offs; and indicators of successful management of personnel, including employee stability. All of such factors are assessed with reference to the judgment of the Committee as to the degree of difficulty of achieving desired outcomes. With respect to payment of annual bonuses and grants of stock options, the Committee also takes note of factors relating to the degree of the Company's success over the most recent year. Specific Objectives and Evaluation In the first quarter of 2019 the compensation committee designated specific objectives with respect to the chief executive officer to be accomplished within the year 2019, and fixed weights to be associated with each such objective. The chief executive officer proposed to the committee specific annual objectives with respect to each other executive officer of the company, which the committee, after making certain modifications, approved. These objectives and the Committee’s administration of the annual incentive bonus element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “ - Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year - Executive Management Bonus Plan.” Grants of Options The Committee's award of stock options to the Company's officers in August 2019 included option grants to the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. In determining the appropriate level of such grant, the Committee considered the long-term performance of the chief executive officer and the desirability of providing significant incentive for future performance, as well as the desirability of ensuring that officer's continued retention by the Company, and the various factors noted above with respect to option grants generally. These grants and the Committee’s administration of the long-term incentive element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “-Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year – Equity Incentives.” Stock Ownership, Hedging and Pledging . Our board of directors and compensation committee have considered whether to establish a minimum stock ownership goal for members of our senior management. We have elected not to do so, considering that such a policy would either be strict and mandatory, in which case it would undermine the compensatory objectives of our equity compensation plans, or would be merely hortatory, in which case it could be expected to have little effect. We’ve also noted that the multiyear vesting terms of the equity incentives granted under our plans have the effect of aligning our executives’ individual personal financial incentives with the future price performance of the Company’s stock. As part of our comprehensive compliance policy, we remind all company executive officers of the mandatory legal prohibition on selling short company shares. We also prohibit company executive officers from entering into transactions that would have the effect of causing those individuals to benefit from a decline in the price of the company stock, such as the purchase of “put” options. We prohibit such “hedging” transactions but we do not find it appropriate to prohibit our executive officers from pledging their shares of company stock as security for a loan. We believe that the beneficial incentives of owning company stock remain substantially the same with or without such a pledge. Summary of Compensation The following table summarizes all compensation earned during the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 by the Company's chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and the other three most highly compensated individuals (such five individuals, the ""named executive officers"") who were serving in such position or as executive officers at any time in 2019. It lists their names, the principal positions in which they served in those years, and each component of compensation paid with respect to those years. Summary Compensation Table Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year Equity Incentives In the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not grant any stock awards or stock appreciation rights to any of our named executive officers. We granted options to substantially all of our management level employees on August 8, 2019. The option grants noted in the tables above and below were awarded to the named executive officers as part of those grants. We also granted awards under our Executive Management Bonus Plan, which were evaluated after the end of the year. The amounts paid are shown in the table above (Summary Compensation Table) as “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” In the August 2019 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($3.53 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. Each of the other executive officers of the Company received a grant at that time on the same terms. Mr. Fritz and Mr. Lavin received such a grant with respect to 90,000 shares, and the other executive officers of the Company each received such a grant with respect to 60,000 shares. The table below provides information regarding the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2019. Grants of Plan-Based Awards The “target” and “maximum” figures appearing in the table above represent the maximum cash payout under the individual executives’ Executive Management Bonus Plan awards as of the date the incentive was fixed. The actual payout to each individual named in the table above has been determined and paid prior to the date of this proxy statement. That amount was in each case materially less than the maximum (approximately 44% of the maximum, in the case of the chief executive). The respective actual payments are described below, and appear above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading “Non-Equity Plan Compensation.” Because each non-equity incentive plan award has been settled and paid, the future payout under such awards as of the date of this report is in each case zero. The “grant date fair value” figures appearing in the table above, which are the computed fair values of stock option awards, are computed as described in note 1 to the Summary Compensation Table. Executive Management Bonus Plan The Executive Management Bonus Plan award granted to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley, called for him to meet as many as possible of seven separate operational and financial objectives within the year 2019. The Compensation Committee assigned to each of those objectives a value as a percentage of base salary. The objectives and their weightings were as follows: to meet the Company’s quarterly budgeted earnings (25% each quarter, total of 100%), to raise $70 million or more of new capital (50%), to renew or replace each of two designated existing warehouse credit facilities on terms equal to or better than those pre-renewal (50%), to acquire a material new servicing portfolio (100%), to execute three rated securitization transactions after the first quarter of 2019 (40% each, 120% total), to achieve annual originations of receivables exceeding each of five targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching aggregate amounts of $800 million, $850 million, $900 million, $950 million, and $1.0 billion), and to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in excess of each of four targets (80% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching prices of $5.00, $5.50, $6.00 and $6.50 per share). The total of the seven weightings is 600%; accordingly, the target and maximum possible value to that officer of the award was 600% of his base salary for 2019. In a series of meetings, the committee evaluated the chief executive’s performance in comparison to the goals. The Compensation Committee determined that the budget objective was met in one of the four quarters of 2019, and credited the chief executive with one increment, or 25%. The Company was not successful in raising new capital during the year, and no credit was given. The Committee noted the successful renewal of both of the two designated warehouse lines, in February and December, and determined that each renewal was on terms that met the stated objective. The Committee therefore credited the chief executive with the full 50% possible. No new portfolio was acquired in 2019, and the Committee found no credit was earned in that respect. The Committee noted that the Company had executed four rated securitizations during the year, three of them after the objective was set, representing creditable performance of 120%. It determined that our originations volume exceeded $1.0 billion for the year while maintaining credit quality, representing creditable performance in the amount of 100%. None of the stock price objectives were fulfilled. The aggregate valuation of all creditable performance for the chief executive officer was thus 295%, which would imply a bonus payment under our Executive Management Bonus Plan of $2,935,000. The committee elected to pay a bonus of somewhat less than the maximum creditable percentage, in the amount of $2,600,000, representing 261% of our chief executive’s base salary. The Executive Management Bonus Plan awards granted to the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer are evaluated on a more subjective basis, and were set by the Compensation Committee in consultation with and on the recommendation of the chief executive officer. Factors used in determining the amount of bonus for the two named executive officers who are executive vice presidents of the Company are these: (I) an evaluation of the executive’s skills and performance, 26.7%, (II) whether the executive has met three individual objectives approved by the compensation committee, 32% in aggregate, (III) whether the Company as a whole has met or exceeded budget targets, 13.3%, (IV) a subjective evaluation of the officer's performance, 53.3%, and (V) a discretionary allocation recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee, 34.7%. Numerical scores are assigned to each of these factors, up to the maximum percentages stated above, and can result in a maximum bonus of 160% of base compensation. Similar factors are applied in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are senior vice presidents of the Company: (I) skills and performance, 20%, (II) three individual objectives, 24%, (III) Company budget, 10%, (IV) subjective evaluation of that executive’s department, 40%, and (V) discretionary allocation, 26%, resulting in a maximum bonus of 120% of base compensation. Following the end of the year 2019, our compensation committee evaluated each named executive officer’s performance in relation to these standards and goals. In two quarters out of four, the Company met its overall budget target, and each officer accordingly received 50% credit with respect to that target. With respect to the individual factors, the compensation committee, acting in part on the advice of our chief executive officer, determined that creditable performance for 2019 for each named executive officer other than the chief executive officer was as set forth below: On that basis, the Compensation Committee approved payments to these named executive officers in the amounts shown in the rightmost column. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2019 the number of unexercised options held by each of the named executive officers, the number of shares subject to then exercisable and unexercisable options held by such persons and the exercise price and expiration date of each such option. Each option referred to in the table was granted at an option price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the date of grant. None of such individuals holds a stock award; accordingly, only information concerning option awards is presented. Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year Four of the five named executive officers exercised stock options during 2019. The table below shows the realized value and the number of options exercised for those four individuals. None of our officers hold stock awards; accordingly, no stock awards vested during 2019. Option Exercises and Stock Vested Executive Management Bonus Plan (Non-equity Incentive Plan) The salary and cash bonus of the named executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation appearing in the Summary Compensation Table above under the caption ""Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"" is paid pursuant to an executive management bonus plan (the “EMB Plan”). The EMB Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee selects participants in the EMB Plan from among the Company’s executive officers and determines the performance goals, target amounts and other terms and conditions of awards under the EMB Plan. With respect to officers other than the chief executive officer, determinations of base salary and of criteria relating to the EMB Plan are based in part on evaluations of such officers prepared by the chief executive officer, which are furnished to and discussed with the Compensation Committee. Director Compensation Throughout 2019, we paid our non-employee directors a retainer of $5,167 per month, with an additional fee of $500 per month for service on a board committee ($1,000 for a committee chairman). Non-employee directors also received per diem fees of $1,000 for attendance in person at meetings of the board of directors, or $500 for attendance by telephone. No per diem fees are paid for attendance at committee meetings. The Board in August 2019 approved issuance to each non-employee director of options to purchase an aggregate of 30,000 shares. The exercise prices of all such options are the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which was $3.53 per share. The following table summarizes compensation received by our directors for the year 2019: ____________________ (1) This column reports cash compensation earned in 2019 for Board and committee service. (2) This column represents the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 2019 fiscal year for the fair value of stock options granted to the directors in 2019. The fair value was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS 123R. The fair value per option was $1.03, based on assumptions of 3.24 years expected life, expected volatility of 38.77%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and a risk-free rate of 1.53%. In addition to the stock option awards granted in 2019, our directors other than Mr. Grasso held at December 31, 2019 option awards granted in previous years. The total options held at December 31, 2019 represent the right to purchase shares as follows: Mr. Bradley, 3,549,999 shares; Mr. Adams, 300,000 shares; Mr. Rayhill, 417,000 shares; Mr. Roberts, 150,000 shares; Mr. Washer, 300,000 shares; and Mr. Wood, 315,000 shares. (3) Mr. Bradley's compensation as chief executive officer of the Company is described elsewhere in this report. He received no additional compensation for service on the Company's Board of Directors. (4) Mr. Grasso joined our Board in October 2019. Pension Plans The Company's officers do not participate in any pension or retirement plan, other than a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (commonly known as a 401(k) plan). Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control This section provides information regarding payments and benefits to the named executive officers that would be triggered by termination of the officer’s employment (including resignation, or voluntary termination; severance, or involuntary termination; and retirement) or a change of control of the Company. Each of the named executive officers is an at-will employee and, as such, does not have an employment contract. In addition, if the officer’s employment terminates for any reason other than a change of control of the Company, any unvested stock options are terminated, and vested options become subject to accelerated expiration: ordinarily three months following separation from service, or twelve months in the case of disability, retirement or death. Accordingly, there are no payments or benefits that are triggered by any termination event (including resignation and severance) other than in connection with a change of control of the Company. Benefits Triggered by Change of Control or Termination after Change of Control Our stock option plans provide that each employee of ours who holds outstanding unexpired options under our stock option may have the right to exercise such options following a change of control of the Company, without regard to the date such option would first be exercisable. Each of the named executive officers holds such options. The “acceleration” of options is mandatory following certain changes of control, and subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee following certain others. Acceleration is mandatory in the event of (i) the sale, or other disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (ii) a merger or similar transaction in which shareholders of the Company hold less than 50% of the shares of the surviving entity; provided, however, that acceleration following a merger or similar transaction is mandatory only if the holder suffers a Qualifying Termination (defined below) within one year following the transaction, or if the surviving entity does not provide the holder with an equivalent award. Acceleration is also mandatory if a holder suffers a Qualifying Termination within one year following (iii) a change within a three-year period in the membership of a majority of the board of directors (excluding changes recommended by the board), or (iv) a person’s acquisition of outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than directly from the Company and without approval of the board, resulting in that person’s having beneficial ownership of greater than 25% of the Company. Under our stock option plans, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to provide for acceleration under other circumstances than those described above with respect to any particular stock option or class of stock options. The committee would expect to exercise its discretion with the intention of preserving the value of the stock option award. To date, such discretion has not been exercised. A “Qualifying Termination” is a termination of the holder’s employment by the Company other than for cause, disability or death, or by the holder for “good reason” (principally relating to a material diminution in the holder’s authority, compensation or responsibilities, or a relocation of greater than 50 miles). The preceding description applies to options held by officers and employees. Options issued to non-employee directors accelerate without the exercise of discretion upon any of the four categories of change of control described above. As of December 31, 2019, no named executive officers would realize a benefit if unvested stock options were to become immediately exercisable upon a change in control, based on the value of the shares underlying such options at the closing market price on December 31, 2019, which was $3.37 per share). Management Structure The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company. Its oversight is aimed at seeing to it that the company’s business is managed to meet our goals, and that the interests of the shareholders are served. Charles E. Bradley currently serves as both the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer, and is the only member of our board who is not independent of the Company. Largely because of the small number of directors (seven members in total), our board has chosen not to designate any individual formally as the lead independent director. Each director retains his full oversight responsibility. Our board structure supports the independence of our non-management directors. Our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee are each composed solely of independent directors. Our bylaws provide that any two directors have the authority to call meetings of the board of directors, as do specified officers, including the president and the secretary. To enhance the possible use of that authority by independent directors, the corporate secretary is under standing instructions to call a meeting at the instance of any one director. The board believes that combining the chairman and chief executive officer positions is currently the most effective leadership structure given Mr. Bradley’s in-depth knowledge of our business and industry and his demonstrated ability to formulate and implement strategic initiatives. Mr. Bradley is continuously involved in developing and implementing our strategies, working closely with the company’s other senior executives to seek continued disciplined growth and excellence in operations. His close involvement in management places Mr. Bradley in the best position to decide which business issues require consideration by the independent directors of the board. In addition, having a combined chairman and chief executive officer enables us to speak with a unified voice to shareholders, customers and others concerned with our company. The board believes that combining the chief executive and chairman roles, as part of a governance structure that includes oversight of management responsibilities by independent directors, provides the preferred system for meeting the requirement that the Company be managed in the best interest of our shareholders. Risk Oversight The board’s overall responsibility for directing the management of the company includes risk oversight. The risk oversight function is performed at the board level, and by the Audit and Compensation Committees. The board of directors as a whole in its regular meetings discusses and considers the risk inherent in the existing business of the Company and in proposed initiatives. Because the Company’s business consists of extending consumer credit to individuals believed to be of higher risk than others (sub-prime credit), the assessment of the risk assumed in such extensions of credit is a primary consideration on the part of the board. Risk oversight is also a key function of the Audit and Compensation Committees. The principal risk management function performed by the Audit Committee is the ongoing assessment of the credit estimates and allowances periodically recorded in the Company’s books. The committee reviews that assessment regularly. Other risk assessments performed by the Audit Committee include assessments of contingent liabilities, and of other reserves and allowances. The principal risk management functions performed by the Compensation Committee are its setting and evaluation of objectives for the chief executive officer, in connection with its administration of the executive management bonus plan. The committee recognizes that the company’s business of extending subprime credit inherently includes a conflict between growing the business and managing the risk of credit losses: one means to increase the company’s business is to offer credit on terms that are priced too low for the risk assumed. The Compensation Committee manages that risk by insisting that objectives to grow the business are qualified by a mandate that credit quality be maintained at appropriate levels. To some extent, such risk management is shared with the Audit Committee, which performs the primary oversight of whether credit risk assumed is reflected with adequate allowances in the company’s financial statements. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The table below sets forth the number and percentage of shares of the our Common Stock (our only class of voting securities) owned beneficially as of April 27, 2020 (the latest practicable date) by (i) each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director and each named executive officer, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers, as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property and similar laws, each of the persons named has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned by such persons. Percent of class is calculated by reference to 22,728,109 shares outstanding on April 27, 2020. Except as otherwise noted, each person named in the table has a mailing address at 3800 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 1400, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. __________ Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents inform a tion regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2019. CEO Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a mandate that public companies disclose the ratio of the compensation of their CEO to their median employee. Our CEO-median employee pay ratio calculation for 2019 is 77:1. We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2019 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2019 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. There have been no changes to our employee population or compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio. Accordingly, we have computed the ratio by reference to the same employee who we identified as our median employee for the year 2017, who was determined using the compensation of employees who were actively employed on December 31, 2017. The total compensation of our median employee in 2019, using the same methodology we use for Mr. Bradley’s Summary Compensation Table compensation, was $51,116. The total compensation of the CEO Charles Bradley in 2019 was $3,929,770. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Citigroup. On July 10, 2008, CPS and its wholly owned subsidiary Folio Funding II, LLC, as borrower, agreed with Citigroup Financial Products Inc. (“CGFP”), an affiliate of Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), to amend and restate the agreements governing a pre-existing revolving residual credit facility. CGFP was the note purchaser in and administrative agent of that credit facility. The amendments included the issuance to an affiliate of CGFP of a ten-year warrant to purchase (for nominal consideration) 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock, which warrant was subsequently transferred to CGFP. Upon issuance of such warrant, CGFP became a person with beneficial ownership of greater than 5% of the Company’s common stock. On March 10, 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing 500,000 of the 2,500,000 shares available for purchase upon exercise of such warrant. On July 10, 2018, CGFP exercised the remaining warrant, receiving 1,999,995 shares after surrender of shares equal in value to the nominal exercise price. In September 2011, and approximately quarterly thereafter, CGMI acted as a placement agent of asset-backed notes issued by securitization trusts sponsored by CPS. The issuances of investment-grade and below investment-grade notes, and the placement compensation to CGMI, from January 1, 2016 to the present, are set forth in the table below. In each case, one or more other placement agents also received compensation for placing such notes, as well as CGMI. On May 11, 2012, the Company entered into a one-year revolving credit agreement (the ""Citi Warehouse Agreement"") and related agreements with affiliates of Citigroup and others, under which the lenders have agreed to lend up to a maximum of $100 million, to be secured by automobile receivables. In connection with the Citi Warehouse Agreement, the Company paid a closing fee of $1,000,000. The Company first incurred indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement in the amount of $9.1 million on May 14, 2012. The Company used the proceeds of that draw for working capital. Following earlier extensions in 2013, 2014 and 2016, the Company and the lenders agreed on September 21, 2018 to extend the revolving term of the Citi Warehouse Agreement to September 21, 2020. At the conclusion of the revolving period, at the election of either the borrower or the lender, the loans are to amortize for an additional one year, and then become due in full. Loans under the Citi Warehouse Agreement bear interest during the revolving period at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.00%, but in all events no less than 3.75% per year, and during the amortization period (if any) at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.00%, but in all events no less than 4.75% per year. The loans are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default. In connection with the 2018 renewal of the Citi Warehouse Agreement, we paid a closing fee of $730,000. The maximum principal amount of indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement during 2019 was $100 million. During 2019, the Company paid $502.6 million of principal and $2.5 million of interest on such debt. As of April 27, 2020, the principal amount owed was $63.8 million. The Company intends to incur additional indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement from time to time as it purchases motor vehicle receivables from dealers CPS Leasing. The Company holds 80% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of CPS Leasing, Inc. (""CPSL""). The remaining 20% of CPSL is held by Charles E. Bradley, Jr., who is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company. CPSL engaged in the equipment leasing business, and is currently in the process of liquidation as its leases come to term. The Company financed the operations of CPSL by making operating advances and by advancing to CPSL the fraction of the purchase prices of its leased equipment that CPSL did not borrow under its lines of credit. The aggregate amounts of the advances made by the Company and outstanding to CPSL as of December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, were approximately $186,000, $153,000, and $122.000, respectively. Subordinated Notes . Director William Roberts on December 3, 2007 purchased $4,000,000 of unsecured subordinated three-year notes directly from the Company. The interest rate was determined by negotiation, and Mr. Roberts and the Company have agreed to a series of successive extensions of such indebtedness, with interest paid at 10% per annum throughout the years 2016 through 2018. The Company in the years 2017 and 2018 paid interest of $400,000 per year on such notes, and in 2019 paid interest of $33,333, in accordance with those terms. The Company repaid the notes in full on February 1, 2019. Policy on Related Party Transactions and Director Independence. The agreements and transactions described above, other than those described under the caption “Citigroup,” were entered into by the Company with parties who personally benefited from such transactions and who had a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company. It is the Company's policy that any such transactions with persons having a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company may take place only if approved by the Audit Committee or by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are disinterested with respect to the transaction, and independent in accordance with the standards for director independence prescribed by Nasdaq. Such policy is maintained in writing in the charter of the Audit Committee. The agreements and transactions above were reviewed and approved by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who were disinterested with respect to the transaction, except that the subordinated notes transaction was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. The seven directors of the Company are Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Chris A. Adams, Louis M. Grasso, Brian J. Rayhill, William B. Roberts, Gregory S. Washer, and Daniel S. Wood, of whom Messrs. Wood, Rayhill and Washer compose the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that other than Mr. Bradley (who is the Company's chief executive officer), each of the other six directors is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Fees Paid to Auditors The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to the Company’s independent registered public accounting firms for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Crowe has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since February 2009, and reported on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2019. (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Audit-related fees comprise fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements. (3) The 2019 and 2018 tax fees represent services rendered in connection with preparation of state and federal tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Audit Committee Supervision of Principal Accountant The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and permitted non-audit fees to be paid to the independent auditor, and authorizes on behalf of the Company the payment of such fees, or refuses such authorization. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman and its vice-chairman the authority to approve performance of services on an interim basis. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, all services for which audit fees or audit related fees were paid were preapproved by the Audit Committee as a whole, or pursuant to such delegated authority. In the course of its meetings, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit fees outlined above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the respective audit firms, and has concluded that such independence is not and was not impaired.

TABLE OF CONTENTS PART I PART II PART III PART IV PART I Item 1. Business Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our primary business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions. We also offer financing directly to sub-prime consumers to facilitate their purchase of a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts"" and all such purchases or acquisitions as “originations” or “acquisitions”. We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. We consist of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “CPS” or “the Company”). From inception through December 31, 2019, we have purchased a total of approximately $16.2 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently in September 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2019 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for non-affiliates. Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The majority of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee sales representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our sales representatives represent us exclusively. They may be located in our Irvine branch, in our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our sales representatives present dealers with a sales package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2019, we had 70 sales representatives, and in that month, we received applications from 6,439 dealers in 46 states. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 78% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2019 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 3.2% of our total acquisitions and represented 2.2% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2019. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 76% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 24% consisted of financing for new cars, as compared to 74% financing for used cars and 26% for new cars in the year ended December 31, 2018. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 84 term securitizations of approximately $14.4 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2019 we have three such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $100 million. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime, borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. We also have a pass-through arrangement with another lender who sends us applications from their dealers in cases where that lender chooses not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received approximately 59% of all applications through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 15% through pass-through arrangements we have with other lenders, 24% via another aggregator, Route One and 2% via our website. Our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the automobile contract meets our underwriting criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. In some cases where we don’t grant an approval, we may discuss with the dealer alternatives from the terms proposed or request and review further information from the dealer. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2019, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we order two credit reports and process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether or not we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on our purchased contracts for the periods shown: Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has been robust over the periods presented, and also by our pricing strategy. The competitive environment in 2017 and 2018 has resulted in generally higher fees paid to dealers in conjunction with our contract acquisitions, compared to the years 2016 and earlier when dealers were generally paying us fees. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recalibrated our risk-based scoring and pricing model which contributed to higher contract interest rates and lower fees paid to dealers in 2019 compared to 2018. Paying fees to dealers increases our capital requirements for acquiring contracts. We have offered eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the sub-prime credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: Bravo - this program accommodated an applicant with significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. Advance rates were the lowest of all of our programs to offset the greater risk. To offset the low up-front advance to the dealer, we agreed to pay the dealer a portion of future payments we receive from the obligor, depending on loan performance. The Bravo program was introduced in November of 2015 and was terminated in November of 2018. First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 76% of our new contract acquisitions in 2019, 79% in 2018, and 73% in 2017, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract in the event that the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations to us. Underwriting For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our underwriting criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. We believe that our underwriting criteria enable us to evaluate effectively the creditworthiness of sub-prime customers and the adequacy of the financed vehicle as security for an automobile contract. The underwriting criteria include standards for price, term, amount of down payment, installment payment and interest rate; mileage, age and type of vehicle; principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle; customer income level, employment and residence stability, credit history and debt service ability, as well as other factors. Specifically, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have in excess of 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 72 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our underwriters verify the customer's employment, income, residency, insurance coverage, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring We use proprietary scoring models to assign each automobile contract two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received and the customer's credit information is retrieved from the credit reporting agencies. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether or not we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including the customer's credit history, data derived from alternative sources such as utilities, telecom, and social media, length of employment, residence stability and total income. Once a vehicle is selected by the customer and a proposed deal structure is provided to us, our scores will then consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value and the make and mileage of the vehicle. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All of the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer in an attempt to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Servicing and Collection We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts that are included in portfolios that we have sold in securitizations or service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; collecting, accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; investigating delinquencies; communicating with the customer to obtain timely payments; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. We are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts in the securitization pools . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our customers can contact us via a toll-free number where they may choose to speak with a collector or to use our automated voice response system to access information about their account or to make a payment. They may respond to our collector’s text messages or chat with one of our collectors while logged into our website. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector will attempt to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we will stop accruing interest on this automobile contract, and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition we will apply a specific reserve to this automobile contract so that the net balance represents the estimated fair value less costs to sell. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon repossession it is stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Prior to sale, the customer has the right to redeem the vehicle by paying the contract in full. In some cases, we may return the vehicle to the customer if they pay all, or what we deem to be a sufficient amount, of the past due amount. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower that are greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 23 months, 23 months and 21 months as of December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we were servicing as of the respective dates shown. The tables do not include the experience of third party servicing portfolios, because we do not bear the credit risk on such portfolios. Delinquency, Repossession and Extension Experience Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. In most cases, the extension will be granted in conjunction with our receiving a past due payment or partial payment from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and psychological commitment to the contract on the obligor’s part. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs. We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2019, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2018: We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off at December 31, 2019 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, in spite of the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 84 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2019, 21 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. In recent years, we have found that the securitizations we conducted in December of those years, had a tendency toward less investor demand in the related bonds than the securitizations we conducted in other times of the year. As a result, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since then have conducted our securitizations near the beginning of each calendar quarter. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, and adding an amortization period through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to February 2023. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017 and again in December 2019, extending the revolving period to December 2021, followed by an amortization period to December 2023. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in July 2010, and many of its provisions became effective in July 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. Further, the CFPB has general supervisory and examination authority over non-depository “larger participants” in the market for automotive finance companies. We are subject to such supervision and examination. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,010 employees. The breakdown of the employees is as follows: 10 were senior management personnel; 612 were servicing personnel; 202 were automobile contract origination personnel; 122 were sales personnel and program development (70 of whom were sales representatives); 64 were various administration personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2020; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the eight years fiscal ended December 31, 2019, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. Our business strategy requires that warehouse credit facilities be available in order to purchase significant volumes of receivables. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $100 million. Each of the three warehouse credit facilities includes a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. If we are unable to maintain warehouse financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Although we have seen improvements in the capital markets from 2010 and thereafter, as compared to 2008 and 2009, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we could expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such higher than expected losses occurred in 2008 through 2010, which had an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Should significant increases in losses reoccur, such recurrence might have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If We Are Unable to Obtain Credit Enhancement for Our Securitizations Upon Favorable Terms, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. In our securitizations from 1994 through 2008, we utilized credit enhancement in the form of one or more financial guaranty insurance policies issued by financial guaranty insurance companies. Each of these policies unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed timely interest and ultimate principal payments on the senior classes of the securities issued in those securitizations. These guarantees enabled those securities to achieve the highest credit rating available. This form of credit enhancement reduced the costs of our securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancement available to us at the time. Due to significantly reduced investor demand for securities carrying such a financial guaranty, this form of credit enhancement may not be economical for us in the future. The 31 securitization transactions we executed from 2010 through 2018 did not utilize financial guaranty insurance policies. Prior to the second quarter of 2014, none of the securities issued in those transactions received the highest possible credit rating from any rating agency. As we pursue future securitizations, we may not be able to obtain: The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. As of the date of this report, it is the consensus of market observers that interest rates on risk-free debt will rise within the next year. If interest rates on risk-free debt do increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, which would adversely affect our results of operations. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, sales, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated for securitizations that are accounted for as financings and warehoused automobile contracts. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., our President and CEO, has been our President since our formation in 1991. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at its own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC has conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. Our industry has also been under investigation by the United States Department of Justice, which has conducted and may continue to conduct an inquiry that appears to be focused on securitization practices. In that inquiry, we received a subpoena in January 2015, which required that we produce specified documents. We have been advised by the Department of Justice that we have provided such information as is required, and that no enforcement action against us is recommended. Although the inquiry commenced January 2015 is thus completed as to us, no assurance can be given as to whether some other government agency may commence inquiries into or actions against us, nor as to whether the DOJ may recommence its investigation, any of which hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank""), adopted in 2010, made numerous changes to the laws applicable to the consumer financial services industry. Among other things, Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products and mandated that other federal agencies adopt rules implementing risk retention requirements in securitizations. We are also subject to regulation by each state in which we operate, and such states’ laws and regulations, and the interpretations thereof, also change from time to time. Compliance with new laws and regulations may be or likely will be costly and can affect operating results. Compliance requires forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables after December 2016 are subject to rick retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Similar but not identical risk retention requirements are applicable after December 2018 to securitization transactions where purchasers of the ABS have sufficient contacts with the European Union. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage in our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We Have Substantial Indebtedness. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2,289.5 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,097.7 million of securitization trust debt, and also included $134.8 million of warehouse lines of credit, $39.5 million of residual interest financing debt and $17.5 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates [at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables]. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Carrying Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the carrying value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous carrying value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the carrying value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in carrying value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Carrying Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Carrying Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our carrying value, we might be required to adjust the carrying value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in carrying value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Ohio, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. The Emergence of a Pandemic and Other Adverse External Events Could Negatively Impact Our Business. Pandemics or concern about a possible pandemic, and other adverse external events, like natural disasters, could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business or upon third parties who perform operational services for the Company or its customers. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s customer base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, cause significant property damage, disrupt the infrastructure that supports our business and the communities we are located in, negatively impact financial markets and interest rates result in lost revenue or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2019, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 5.4 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 24%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

See "" Where You Can Find More Information "" and "" Documents Incorporated by Reference. "" Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.5 million, increasing to approximately $1.7 million through 2022. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 129,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $4.0 million, increasing to approximately $4.5 million through 2022. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Lombard, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2019 to 2025. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.4 million increasing to approximately $1.6 million through 2025. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation . We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2019, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including each of the matters described or referenced above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2019 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2019 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we also originate vehicle purchase money loans by lending directly to consumers and have (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through September 30, 2019, we have originated a total of approximately $16.0 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2011. Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are shown in the table below: Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in that California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. All of our active securitizations are structured as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, and (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction. For automobile contracts acquired before 2018, we also periodically record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts; for automobile contracts acquired after 2017 we take account of estimated credit losses in our computation of a level yield used to determine recognition of interest on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 84 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated. As of December 31, 2019, 21 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. Since September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structures without any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since that time have generally conducted our securitizations near the beginning of each calendar quarter. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, with an optional amortization period through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to February 2023. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017 and again in December 2019, extending the revolving period to December 2021, followed by an amortization period to December 2023. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. In a securitization, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Amortization of Deferred Origination Costs and Acquisition Fees, (d) Term Securitizations, (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the carrying value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the carrying value, an adjustment would be required. In the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2019, the net present value of the forecasted cash flows for the receivables acquired in the first and second quarter of 2018 exceeded the carrying value of that pool by $2.1 million, which we have recorded as a mark to market value of that pool of receivables. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial carrying value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Amortization of Deferred Originations Costs and Acquisition Fees Upon purchase of a contract from a dealer, we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain direct costs associated with acquisitions of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract using the interest method. Receivables acquired after 2017 are accounted for using fair value. In accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables, any dealer acquisition fees will be incorporated into acquisition price of the receivables and no direct costs will be deferred. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( "" spread account "" ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2019, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2019, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 84 term securitizations of approximately $14.4 billion in contracts. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the end of 2009, we observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts. These changes included reduced liquidity, and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Moreover, during that period many of the firms that previously provided financial guarantees, which were an integral part of our securitizations, suspended offering such guarantees. These adverse changes caused us to conserve liquidity by significantly reducing our purchases of automobile contracts. However, since September 2009 we have established new funding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases and the frequency and amount of our term securitizations. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31, 2018 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenues were $345.8 million, a decrease of $44.0 million, or 11.3%, from the prior year revenues of $389.8 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased $43.2 million, or 11.4%, to $337.1 million from $380.3 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Other income decreased by $730,000, or 7.2%, to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $10.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decrease of $1.2 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $740,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of interest expense, provision for credit losses, employee costs, sales and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses is affected by the balance and credit performance of our portfolio of finance receivables (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Interest expense is significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and the use of our warehouse facilities and asset-backed securitizations to finance those contracts. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $336.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $371.1 million for the prior year, a decrease of $34.4 million, or 9.3%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in interest expense, employee costs, and general and administrative expenses. Employee costs increased by $1.6 million or 2.0%, to $80.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, representing 24.0% of total operating expenses, from $79.3 million for the prior year, or 24.5% of total operating expenses. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2019 and 2018: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $33.0 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 6.3%, compared to the previous year and represented 9.8% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $9.1 million to $110.5 million, or 8.9%, compared to $101.5 million in the previous year. Interest expense represented 32.8% of total operating expenses in 2019. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.9 million, or 7.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt increased 1.9% to $2,181.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2019 also increased to 4.4% from 4.2% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. The cost of funds had moved up in 2018 before trending downward in 2019. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 4.2% in the prior year. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on our subordinated renewable notes decreased by $11,000, or 0.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The average balance of the notes decreased from $16.5 million in the prior year to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, the average interest rate on our subordinated notes increased to 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 from 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $3.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 million in the prior year. This transaction closed in May 2018 and was not outstanding for the full year in 2018. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit increased by $650,000, or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due to the higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 11.6% in 2018 to 9.7% in 2019. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: The reduction in the annualized yield on our finance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year period is the result of the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The average balance of these receivables was $1,212.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to $447.2 million in the prior year period. Provision for credit losses was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $47.3 million, or 35.5% compared to the prior year and represented 25.5% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowance requires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables. In addition, we monitor the delinquency and net charge off rates in our portfolio to consider how such rates may affect the allowance for finance credit losses. The allowance applies only to our finance receivables originated through December 2017, which we refer to as our legacy portfolio. Since no receivables have been added to the legacy portfolio since December 2017, it has seasoned to the point where its weighted age is 42 months at December 31, 2019. We have also observed that receivables originated in 2017 have incurred credit losses at a significantly lower rate than receivables we originated in 2015 and 2016. The age of the legacy portfolio, its continuously declining balance and the significant variance of the relative credit performance of the vintage pools that make up the legacy portfolio have contributed to lower provisions for credit losses and lower levels of the allowance for finance credit losses. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income under the interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. Sales expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expenses increased by $321,000, or 1.8%, to $17.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $17.6 million in the prior year, and represented 5.3% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we purchased 55,919 contracts representing $1,002.8 million in receivables compared to 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables in the prior year. Occupancy expenses decreased by $120,000 or 1.6%, to $7.5 million compared to $7.6 million in the previous year and represented 2.2% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $84,000 or 8.5%, to $1,076,000 compared to $992,000 in the previous year and represented 0.2% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 41.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes $2.1 million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of the tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues were $389.8 million, a decrease of $44.6 million, or 10.3%, from the prior year revenues of $434.4 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased $43.9 million, or 10.3%, to $380.3 million from $424.2 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Other income decreased by $774,000, or 8.2%, to $8.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $9.5 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decrease of $600,000 in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers, and a decrease of $200,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, sales and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $371.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $402.3 million for the prior year, a decrease of $31.2 million, or 7.8%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in employee costs, interest expense, sales and general and administrative expenses. Employee costs increased by $6.4 million or 8.7%, to $79.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing 21.4% of total operating expenses, from $73.0 million for the prior year, or 18.1% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for the prior year period were net of $5.4 million of direct employee costs associated with the originations of contracts during that period. Such deferred costs are then recognized over the life of the related receivables using the interest method. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2018 and 2017: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $31.0 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 16.8%, compared to the previous year and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $9.1 million to $101.5 million, or 9.9%, compared to $92.3 million in the previous year. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.8 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 1.5% to $2,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,172.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the blended interest rates on our term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014. As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 4.2%, compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization trust debt interest costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.8% in the prior year. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on our subordinated debt increased by $117,000, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was the result of an increase in the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was also the result of an increase in the average balance of the notes from $16.0 million in the prior year to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no residual interest financing debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $181,000, or 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 12.7% in 2017 to 11.6% in 2018. However, most of the decrease in interest expense was offset by higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2018 compared to 2017. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Provision for credit losses was $133.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $53.6 million, or 28.7% compared to the prior year and represented 35.9% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income under the interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. This is the primary reason for the reduction in provision for credit losses in 2018. Sales expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee sales representatives. Our sales representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Sales expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 12.5%, to $17.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $15.6 million in the prior year, and represented 4.7% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables compared to 52,643 contracts representing $859.1 million in receivables in the prior year. Occupancy expenses increased by $445,000 or 6.2%, to $7.6 million compared to $7.2 million in the previous year and represented 2.1% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $58,000 or 6.2%, to $992,000 compared to $934,000 in the previous year and represented 0.3% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes $2.1 million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of the tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 88.3%. This includes $15.1 million of income tax expense related to the effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 41.1%. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our purchases of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from the proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities (also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities), customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitization transactions and their related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the purchases of automobile contracts, repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit, securitization transactions and otherwise, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those pools and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to acquire and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $216.8 million, $216.2 million and $215.6 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and interest accretion on fair value receivables. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $229.4 million, $242.2 million and $210.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to purchases of automobile contracts. Purchases of finance receivables were $1,004.2 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $914.9 million and $859.1 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $23.3 million and $31.4 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.0 million. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily related to the issuance of securitization trust debt, reduced by the amount of repayment of securitization trust debt and net proceeds or repayments on our warehouse lines of credit and other debt. We issued $1,000.5 million in new securitization trust debt in 2019 compared to $855.8 million in 2018 and $852.6 million in 2017. Repayments of securitization debt were $966.1 million, $876.1 million and $851.2 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximately equal to their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. We have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and our securitization transactions for long term financing of our contracts. In addition, we have accessed other sources, such as residual financings and subordinated debt in order to finance our continuing operations. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we purchase automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrestricted cash of $5.3 million and $163.2 million aggregate available borrowings under our three warehouse credit facilities (assuming the availability of sufficient eligible collateral). As of December 30, 2019, we had approximately $12.9 million of such eligible collateral. During 2019 we completed four securitizations aggregating $1,000.5 million of notes sold. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. Our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain of our debt agreements other than our term securitizations contain cross-default provisions. Such cross-default provisions would allow the respective creditors to declare a default if an event of default occurred with respect to other indebtedness of ours, but only if such other event of default were to be accompanied by acceleration of such other indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. We have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2,289.5 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,097.7 million of securitization trust debt and $134.8 million of debt from warehouse lines of credit. Since 2005, we have offered renewable subordinated notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from six months to 10 years. We had $17.5 million in subordinated renewable notes outstanding at December 31, 2019. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. At December 31, 2019, $40.0 million of this residual interest financing debt remains outstanding ($39.5 million net of deferred financing costs). Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. If we fail to pay our indebtedness when due, it could have a material adverse effect on us and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands): We anticipate repaying debt due in 2019 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 87.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In September 2018, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to September 2020 and to include an amortization period through September 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2019 there was $96.2 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in April 2015. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023. At December 31, 2019 there was $40.6 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2019 there was no amount outstanding under this facility. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2019, $40.0 million of residual interest financing debt remains outstanding. This amount does not exclude $522,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our consolidated balance sheets. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 34 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $2,097.7 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2019. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2019 there were $17.5 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain "" forward-looking statements "". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "" anticipates, "" "" expects, "" "" plans, "" "" estimates, "" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data This report includes Consolidated Financial Statements, notes thereto and an Independent Auditors’ Report, at the pages indicated below, in the "" Index to Financial Statements. "" Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "" Exchange Act "" ) as of December 31, 2018 (the "" Evaluation Date "" ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report. Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Fritz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Las Vegas, Nevada Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ CROWE LLP Los Angeles, California March 16, 2020 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. ( "" CPS "" ) was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "" Company "" ) specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ( "" Contracts "" ) originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers ( "" Dealers "" ) located throughout the United States. Dealers located in California, Ohio, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida and represented 12.6%, 10.8%, 6.3%, 5.4% and 4.9%, respectively, of contracts purchased during 2019 compared with 8.7%, 8.8%, 5.2%, 6.2% and 6.0% respectively in 2018. No other state had a concentration in excess of 4.9% in 2019. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80% owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2019, our unrestricted cash balance was $5.3 million, which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the carrying value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the carrying value, an adjustment would be required. In the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, the net present value of the forecasted cash flows for the receivables acquired in the first and second quarter of 2018 exceeded the carrying value of that pool by $2.1 million, which we have recorded as a mark to market value of that pool of receivables. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial carrying value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. For each monthly pool of contracts that we purchase, we begin establishing the allowance in the month of acquisition and increase it over the subsequent 11 months, through a provision for credit losses charged to our Consolidated Statement of Income. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $7.5 million and $8.9 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Treatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "" overcollateralization "" of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The majority of the Company’s revenues come from interest income which is outside the scope of ASC 606. The Company’s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within Other Income and are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies its obligation to the customer. Services within the scope of ASC 606 include revenue associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Earnings Per Share Earnings per share were calculated using the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the related period. The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Incremental shares of 11.3 million, 10.3 million and 7.5 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan We recognize compensation costs in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2019, which represents our best estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The revised accounting guidance changes the criteria under which credit losses are measured. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to establish credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 was initially scheduled to become effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, however on October 16, 2019, the FASB changed the effective date for smaller reporting companies to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption would still be permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating whether to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-13, however, it is expected that the new CECL model will alter the assumptions used in calculating the Company's credit losses for receivables acquired prior to 2018, given the change to estimated losses for the estimated life of the financial asset, and will likely result in a material effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted guidance Accounting Standards Update (“ASU 2016-02”) Topic 842, “Leases” using the modified retrospective transition method. Prior comparable periods are presented accordance with previous guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 840, “Leases.” The Company also elected the package of practical expedients, ASU 2018-11. This election allowed the Company to not reassess if expired or existing contracts contain leases, to not reassess lease classifications for any expired or existing leases and to not reassess existing leases initial direct costs. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $135.5 million and $117.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $54.8 million and $48.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finance receivables totaling $31.4 million and $31.8 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. We use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as ""static pooling,"" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. The estimate for probable incurred credit losses is reduced by our estimate for future recoveries on previously incurred losses. Provision for credit losses is charged to our consolidated statement of income. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $1,076,000, $992,000 and $934,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (5) Securitization Trust Debt We have completed numerous term securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these transactions is shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Securitization trust debt,” and the components of such debt are summarized in the following table: _________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $12.0 million and $11.8 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2019. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2019, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $135.5 million. Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are summarized below: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $2.0 million and $1.2 million as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 87.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In September 2018, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to September 2020 and to include an amortization period through September 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2019 there was $96.2 million outstanding under this facility. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2019 there was $40.6 million outstanding under this facility. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 4.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 5.00% per annum. In December 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to December 2021 followed by an amortization period through December 2023 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2019 there was no amount outstanding under this facility. The total outstanding debt on our three warehouse lines of credit was $136.8 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $138.1 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The costs incurred in conjunction with the above debt are recorded as deferred financing costs on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are more fully described in Note 1. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Unamortized debt issuance costs of $522,000 have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of long term debt as of December 31, 2019: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2019, we purchased 378,470 shares of our common stock at an average price of $3.97. In October 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of our common stock. There is approximately $6.1 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015 and again in July 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000 and 19,200,000, respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.11, $1.06 and $1.32, respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 37% to 39% for 2019, 31% to 34% for 2018, and 35% to 37% for 2017. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $2.1 million, $3.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $3.1 million. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $4.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $4.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $1.4 million and $869,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2019 and cash of $422,000 was received. At December 31, 2019, there were a total of 1,458,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2019 for stock options under the 2006 and 1997 plans is as follows: Number of Shares (in thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We did not issue any stock options with an exercise price above or below the market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. In connection with the amendment to and partial repayment of our residual interest financing in July 2008, we issued warrants exercisable for 2,500,000 common shares, and allocated $4,071,429 of the aggregate consideration received in that transaction to the issuance of the warrants. The warrants represented the right to purchase CPS common shares at a nominal exercise price. In March 2010 we repurchased the warrants for 500,000 of these shares for $1.0 million. Warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares were exercised on July 10, 2018 and 1,999,995 net shares were issued to the holder, following surrender of five shares in payment of the exercise price. (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million which include a $2.1 million net tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Without the benefit, income tax expense for 2018 would have been $5.9 million. The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $15.5 million as of December 31, 2019 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $15.5 million consists of approximately $11.5 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $4.0 million of net state deferred tax assets. The major components of the deferred tax asset are $21.2 million in net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $70.5 million. These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2024. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2019, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. (10) Related Party Transactions In December 2007, one of our directors purchased a $4.0 million subordinated renewable note pursuant to our ongoing program of issuing such notes to the public. The note was purchased through the registered agent and under the same terms and conditions, including the interest rate, that were offered to other purchasers at the time the note was issued. The note was redeemed at par plus accrued interest in February 2019. (11) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company has operating leases for corporate offices, equipment, software and hardware. The Company has entered into operating leases for the majority of its real estate locations, primarily office space. These leases are generally for periods of three to seven years with various renewal options. The depreciable life of leased assets is limited by the expected lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine if a contract contains a lease at contract inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, we use the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Right-of-use assets are included in other assets and lease liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019. The following table presents the supplemental balance sheet information related to leases: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table presents the leases expense included in Occupancy, General and administrative on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations: The following table presents the supplemental cash flow information related to leases: Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation . We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our sales representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . In General. There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2019, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including each of the matters described or referenced above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2019 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2019 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (12) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $1.6 million, $1.5 million, and $1.2 respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2019 and 2018: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25% per annum as of December 31, 2019. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2020 is $382,000. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, is as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ________________________ (13) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2019, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $28.9 million. We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $21.4 million, which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 26%, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $7.5 million. The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2018 was $8.9 million after applying a valuation adjustment of $24.6 million. There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2019 and 2018. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14) Subsequent Events On January 15, 2020 we executed our first securitization of 2020. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $260.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by $260.0 million in automobile receivables originated by CPS. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2020-A, consist of six classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Moody’s and DBRS, and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and CPS’s experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 3.08%. The 2020-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance. The transaction agreements require accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 4.00% of the original receivable pool balance, or 11.00% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction utilized a pre-funding structure, in which CPS sold approximately $170.9 million of receivables at inception and approximately $89.1 million of additional receivables in February 2020. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. ",0000889609,CPSS

As president of Carclo, Mr. Wood was responsible for the overall operation of that company and for the quality and integrity of its financial statements. He brings to the Board the knowledge and perspective useful in evaluating the Company’s financial statements, and broad organizational and management skills. Executive Officers The information regarding the Company’s executive officers set forth in Part I of this report under the caption “Executive Officers of the Registrant” is incorporated herein by reference. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance Directors, executive officers and holders of in excess of 10% of the Company's common stock are required to file reports concerning their transactions in and holdings of equity securities of the Company. Based on a review of reports filed by each such person, and inquiry of each regarding holdings and transactions, the Company believes that all reports required with respect to the year 2018 were timely filed. Code of Ethics The Company has adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to the Company's chief executive officer, chief financial officer, controller and others. A copy of the Code of Ethics may be obtained at no charge by written request to the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal executive offices. Audit and Other Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating Committee. Each of these three committees operates under a written charter, adopted by the Board of Directors. The charters are available on the Company’s website, www.consumerportfolio.com/charters.html . The Board of Directors has concluded that each member of these three committees (every director other than Mr. Bradley, the Company's chief executive officer), is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them have a material relationship with the Company that would impair their independence from management or otherwise compromise the ability to act as an independent director. The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Wood (chairman), Mr. Rayhill and Mr. Washer. The Audit Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to review the financial books and records of the Company in consultation with the Company's accounting and auditing staff and its independent auditors and to review with the accounting staff and independent auditors any questions that may arise with respect to accounting and auditing policy and procedure. The Board of Directors has further determined that Mr. Wood has the qualifications and experience necessary to serve as an ""audit committee financial expert"" as such term is defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Mr. Wood, as president of Carclo Technical Plastics, was responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the audited financial statements of that company. Item 11. Executive Compensation. Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee directors Chris Adams (chairman), William Roberts and Daniel Wood. From December 2007 through January 2019, Mr. Roberts held $4,000,000 of subordinated notes issued by the Company. The board of directors considered whether such holdings would reasonably be expected to impair Mr. Roberts’ exercise of independent judgment, and concluded that his independence was not impaired. In coming to that conclusion, the board noted that the Company’s repayment obligation was subordinated to all other debt of the Company, creating a near-alignment of interest with the holders of common stock, and also noted Mr. Roberts’ substantial beneficial ownership of Company common stock. Compensation Committee Report The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this report. Based on such review and discussions and relying thereon, we have recommended to the Company's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis set forth below be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE Compensation Discussion and Analysis 2018 Say-on-Pay Advisory Vote Outcome The Compensation Committee annually considers the results of the most recent advisory vote by shareholders to approve executive officer compensation. In the 2018 advisory vote, 57% of the voted shares approved the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee took note of the closeness of that vote in considering whether to make material changes to the Company’s compensation policies, and chose to stay the course.. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from future shareholder advisory votes regarding executive officer compensation in its future administration of executive compensation. Compensation Objectives The Company's objectives with respect to compensation are several. The significant objectives are to cause compensation (i) to be sufficient in total amount to provide reasonable assurance of retaining key executives, (ii) to include a significant contingent component, so as to provide strong incentives to meet designated Company objectives, and (iii) to include a significant component tied to the price of the Common Stock, so as to align management's incentives with shareholder interests. The compensation committee (""Committee"") of the Company's Board of Directors is charged with administering the Company’s compensation plans to meet those objectives. To the extent that elements of compensation would not advance such objectives, or would do so less effectively than would other elements, the Committee seeks to avoid paying compensation in those forms. Role of the Compensation Committee and the chief executive officer Our Board of Directors has authorized the Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, to make all decisions regarding executive compensation, including administration of our compensation plans. In that regard, the Compensation Committee: The Compensation Committee is authorized to form subcommittee(s) and to retain experts and consultants to assist in the discharge of its responsibilities. To date it has not done so. The chief executive officer, who attends meetings of the Compensation Committee by invitation of the Committee’s chairman, assists the Committee in determining the compensation of our other executive officers by, among other things: The other executive officers do not have a role in determining their own compensation, other than to discuss their annual individual performance objectives and results achieved with the chief executive officer. Our Overall Approach The Committee has put into place a compensation system consisting of three key components: base salary, an annual cash bonus pursuant to an incentive plan, and long-term equity incentives in the form of stock options. The table below provides comparative information regarding the components of our year 2018 executive compensation program. We are applying substantially the same elements in our executive compensation program for the year 2019. · Attract and retain high quality personnel · Targeted to be superior to compensation offered by our competitors · Achieve objectives set annually · Annual bonus amount is set and computed as a percentage of base salary · Actual payout determined by Company and individual performance · Target total cash (base salary + target bonus) designed to be superior to compensation offered by our competitors · Align interests of executives with those of shareholders; · Target long-term incentive award size designed to retain executives through long-term vesting and the potential for wealth accumulation, contingent on benefit to the shareholders The Committee has from time to time considered providing additional elements of executive compensation. It has considered elements such as restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, compensation contingent on a change in control, defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation, and supplemental retirement plans (supplemental in the sense that they exceed the limits for tax advantaged treatment). To date, the Committee has elected not to pay compensation in such forms, having determined that the Company's objectives are better met by one or more of the elements of compensation that it does pay. Regarding restricted stock and restricted stock units, the Committee has noted that any form of equity equivalent to or closely tied to common stock does serve to meet the objective of aligning officers' personal interest with that of the shareholders generally. The Committee believes, however, that the objective is better met by grants of stock options than by grants of share equivalents, because recipients of the grants will face the same degree of variance in results at a lesser cost to the Company, when option grants are compared to grants of restricted stock units. Further, unlike restricted stock, option grants will not provide a reward to the holder absent an improvement over time in the Company’s stock price. The committee has elected not to provide material perquisites as compensation, having determined that cash is a better medium of exchange. Regarding compensation that would be payable contingent on a change in control of the Company, the Committee believes that there are certain legitimate objectives to be met by such contingent compensation. As of the date of this proxy statement, however, no such contingent compensation plans are in place. Regarding defined benefit pension plans, deferred cash compensation and supplemental retirement plans, the Committee believes that the Company's retention objective is better met by straight cash payments, whether in the form of base salary or in the form of bonus compensation. In particular with respect to plans for deferred compensation, the Committee believes those make sense for the Company and for the recipient only on the basis of assumptions regarding future tax rates payable by each. Having no assurance that such assumptions would be correct, the Committee has chosen not to put into place any special deferred compensation programs for the company’s executive officers. Those officers do participate in a company-sponsored tax-deferred savings plan, commonly known as a 401(k) plan, on the same terms available to company employees generally. The Committee may in the future revisit its conclusions as to any of the components discussed above, or may consider other forms of compensation. The Base Salary Element With respect to the retention objective, the Committee considers an executive's base salary to be the most critical component. Acting primarily on the basis of recommendations of the chief executive officer, the Committee adjusts other officers' base salaries annually, with the adjustment generally consisting of a 2% to 10% increase from the prior year's rate. Where exceptional circumstances apply, such as recruitment of a new executive officer, a promotion to executive officer status or a special need to retain an individual officer, the chief executive officer may recommend, and the Committee may approve, a larger increase. The Company's general approach in setting the annual compensation of its named executive officers is to set those officers’ base compensation by reference to their base rates for the preceding year. During the year ended December 2018, the Company's chief executive officer, Charles E. Bradley, Jr., received $995,000 in base salary. In setting that rate in January 2018, the Committee considered the base salary rate that the Company had paid in the prior year ($995,000), the desirability of providing an annual increase, the desirability of ensuring retention of the services of the Company's incumbent chief executive officer, the Company’s financial performance, and the levels of chief executive officer compensation prevailing among other financial services companies. Subsequent to year-end, the Committee considered whether to adjust officers’ base compensation for 2019, and determined not to increase the base rate for the chief executive officer, nor for the other named executive officers. The Annual Incentive Bonus (EMB) element To encourage executive officers and key management personnel to exercise their best efforts and management skills toward causing the Company to meet its overall objective, and toward achieving designated specific individual objectives, the Company has implemented an Executive Management Bonus Plan, with annual payouts. Under the Company's bonus plan as applied to the year ended December 2018, the Company’s two executive vice presidents (each of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 160% of their base salaries, and the Company’s senior vice presidents (one of whom is among the named executive officers) were eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 120% of their base salaries. The chief executive officer was eligible to receive a cash bonus of up to 600% of his base salary. The implementation of this element for the year 2018 is discussed below. The Long-Term Incentive Compensation Element The Committee also awards incentive and non-qualified stock options under the Company's stock option plans. Such awards are designed to assist in the retention of key executives and management personnel and to create an incentive to create shareholder value over a sustained period of time. The Company believes that stock options are a valuable tool in compensating and retaining employees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Committee granted stock options to the Company's executive officers. All such grants were awarded in May 2018, and all carry exercise prices equal to the market price for the Company's common stock at the date of grant The terms of such options are described below, under the caption ""Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year."" The numbers of shares made subject to each of the option grants were based on various factors relating to the responsibilities of the individual officers and to the extent of previous grants to such individuals. Because the exercise price of all options granted is equal to or above the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, the option holders may realize value only if the stock price appreciates from the price on the date the options were granted. This design is intended to focus executives on the enhancement of shareholder value over the long term. Other Elements The Company also maintains certain broad-based employee benefit plans, such as medical and dental insurance, and a qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (401(k) plan), in which executive officers are permitted to participate. Such officers participate on the same terms as non-executive personnel who meet applicable eligibility criteria, and are subject to any legal limitations on the amounts that may be contributed or the benefits that may be payable under the plans. The Company does not maintain any form of defined benefit pension or retirement plan in which executive officers may participate, nor does it maintain any form of supplemental retirement savings or supplemental deferred compensation plan. Exercise of Discretion In exercising its discretion as to the level of executive compensation and its components, the Committee considers a number of factors. Members of the Committee conduct informal surveys of compensation paid to comparable executives within and without the consumer finance industry. The Committee finds these data useful primarily in evaluating the overall level of compensation paid or to be paid to the Company's executive officers. The Committee noted that the Company met and exceeded its budget objectives for the year. Operational factors considered included individual and group management goals; indicators of the performance and credit quality of the Company's servicing portfolio, including levels of delinquencies and charge-offs; and indicators of successful management of personnel, including employee stability. All of such factors are assessed with reference to the judgment of the Committee as to the degree of difficulty of achieving desired outcomes. With respect to payment of annual bonuses and grants of stock options, the Committee also takes note of factors relating to the degree of the Company's success over the most recent year. Specific Objectives and Evaluation In the first quarter of 2018 the compensation committee designated specific objectives with respect to the chief executive officer to be accomplished within the year 2018, and fixed weights to be associated with each such objective. The chief executive officer proposed to the committee specific annual objectives with respect to each other executive officer of the company, which the committee, after making certain modifications, approved. These objectives and the Committee’s administration of the annual incentive bonus element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “ - Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year - Executive Management Bonus Plan.” Grants of Options The Committee's award of stock options to the Company's officers in May 2018 included option grants to the chief executive officer and the other named executive officers. In determining the appropriate level of such grant, the Committee considered the long-term performance of the chief executive officer and the desirability of providing significant incentive for future performance, as well as the desirability of ensuring that officer's continued retention by the Company, and the various factors noted above with respect to option grants generally. These grants and the Committee’s administration of the long-term incentive element of compensation are discussed in detail below, under the heading “-Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year – Equity Incentives.” Stock Ownership, Hedging and Pledging . Our board of directors and compensation committee have considered whether to establish a minimum stock ownership goal for members of our senior management. We have elected not to do so, considering that such a policy would either be strict and mandatory, in which case it would undermine the compensatory objectives of our equity compensation plans, or would be merely hortatory, in which case it could be expected to have little effect. We’ve also noted that the multiyear vesting terms of the equity incentives granted under our plans have the effect of aligning our executives’ individual personal financial incentives with the future price performance of the Company’s stock. As part of our comprehensive compliance policy, we remind all company executive officers of the mandatory legal prohibition on selling short company shares. We also prohibit company executive officers from entering into transactions that would have the effect of causing those individuals to benefit from a decline in the price of the company stock, such as the purchase of “put” options. We prohibit such “hedging” transactions but we do not find it appropriate to prohibit our executive officers from pledging their shares of company stock as security for a loan. We believe that the beneficial incentives of owning company stock remain substantially the same with or without such a pledge. Summary of Compensation The following table summarizes all compensation earned during the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 by the Company's chief executive officer, its chief financial officer, and the other three most highly compensated individuals (such five individuals, the ""named executive officers"") who were serving in such position or as executive officers at any time in 2018. It lists their names, the principal positions in which they served in those years, and each component of compensation paid with respect to those years. Summary Compensation Table Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Last Fiscal Year Equity Incentives In the year ended December 31, 2018, we did not grant any stock awards or stock appreciation rights to any of our named executive officers. We granted options to substantially all of our management level employees on May 9, 2018. The option grants noted in the tables above and below were awarded to the named executive officers as part of those grants. We also granted awards under our Executive Management Bonus Plan, which were evaluated in January of 2019, and have been paid. The amounts paid are shown in the table above (Summary Compensation Table) as “Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation.” In the May 2018 grant, the chief executive officer received an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company's common stock at the market closing price ($3.48 per share) on the date of grant, with such right to purchase to become exercisable in increments of 25% on each of the first through fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and to expire on the seventh anniversary. Each of the other executive officers of the Company received a grant at that time on the same terms. Mr. Fritz and Mr. Lavin received such a grant with respect to 90,000 shares, and the other executive officers of the Company each received such a grant with respect to 60,000 shares. The table below provides information regarding the awards granted to the named executive officers in 2018. Grants of Plan-Based Awards The “target” and “maximum” figures appearing in the table above represent the maximum cash payout under the individual executives’ Executive Management Bonus Plan awards as of the date the incentive was fixed. The actual payout to each individual named in the table above has been determined and paid prior to the date of this proxy statement. That amount was in each case materially less than the maximum (approximately 45% of the maximum, in the case of the chief executive). The respective actual payments are described below, and appear above in the Summary Compensation Table under the heading “Non-Equity Plan Compensation.” Because each non-equity incentive plan award has been settled and paid, the future payout under such awards as of the date of this report is in each case zero. The “grant date fair value” figures appearing in the table above, which are the computed fair values of stock option awards, are computed as described in note 1 to the Summary Compensation Table. Executive Management Bonus Plan The Executive Management Bonus Plan award granted to the chief executive officer, Mr. Bradley, called for him to meet as many as possible of seven separate operational and financial objectives within the year 2018. The Compensation Committee assigned to each of those objectives a value as a percentage of base salary. The objectives and their weightings were as follows: to meet the Company’s quarterly budgeted earnings (25% each quarter, total of 100%), to raise $50 million or more of debt capital (50%), to renew a designated existing warehouse credit facility on terms equal to or better than those pre-renewal (50%), to acquire a material new servicing portfolio (100%), to execute three rated securitization transactions after the first quarter of 2018 (40% each, 120% total), to increase the Company’s annual originations of receivables to each of five targets (100% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching aggregate amounts of $800 million, $850 million, $900 million, $950 million, and $1.0 billion), and to cause the Company’s common stock to trade in excess of each of four targets (80% in the aggregate, creditable in increments of 20% for reaching prices of $5.00, $5.50, $6.00 and $6.50 per share). The total of the seven weightings is 600%; accordingly, the target and maximum possible value to that officer of the award was 600% of his base salary for 2018. In a series of meetings, the committee evaluated the chief executive’s performance in comparison to the goals. The Compensation Committee determined that the budget objective was met in two of the four quarters of 2018, and credited the chief executive with half of the maximum value, or 50%. The Company was successful in raising new debt capital in May 2018, in the amount of $40 million. The Committee accordingly determined that creditable performance of 40%, out of the target of 50%, had been achieved. The Committee also determined that the September renewal of the designated warehouse line was on materially better terms than those previously in place, and credited the chief executive with the full 50% designated for that objective. No new portfolio was acquired in 2018, and the Committee found no credit was earned in that respect. The Committee noted that the Company had executed four rated securitizations during the year, three of them after the objective was set, representing creditable performance of 120%. It determined that our originations volume exceeded $900 million for the year while maintaining credit quality, representing creditable performance in the amount of 60%. None of the stock price objectives were fulfilled. The aggregate valuation of all creditable performance for the chief executive officer was thus 320%, which would imply a bonus payment under our Executive Management Bonus Plan of $3,184,000. The committee elected to pay a bonus of somewhat less than the maximum creditable percentage, in the amount of $2,700,000, representing 271% of our chief executive’s base salary. The Executive Management Bonus Plan awards granted to the named executive officers other than the chief executive officer are evaluated on a more subjective basis, and were set by the Compensation Committee in consultation with and on the recommendation of the chief executive officer. Factors used in determining the amount of bonus for the two named executive officers who are executive vice presidents of the Company are these: (I) an evaluation of the executive’s skills and performance, 26.7%, (II) whether the executive has met three individual objectives approved by the compensation committee, 32% in aggregate, (III) whether the Company as a whole has met or exceeded budget targets, 13.3%, (IV) a subjective evaluation of the officer's performance, 53.3%, and (V) a discretionary allocation recommended by the chief executive officer and approved by the compensation committee, 34.7%. Numerical scores are assigned to each of these factors, up to the maximum percentages stated above, and can result in a maximum bonus of 160% of base compensation. Similar factors are applied in determining the amount of annual bonus for executive officers who are senior vice presidents of the Company: (I) skills and performance, 20%, (II) three individual objectives, 24%, (III) Company budget, 10%, (IV) subjective evaluation of that executive’s department, 40%, and (V) discretionary allocation, 26%, resulting in a maximum bonus of 120% of base compensation. Following the end of the year 2018, our compensation committee evaluated each named executive officer’s performance in relation to these standards and goals. In two quarters out of four, the Company met its overall budget target, and each officer accordingly received 50% credit with respect to that target. With respect to the individual factors, the compensation committee, acting in part on the advice of our chief executive officer, determined that creditable performance for 2018 for each named executive officer other than the chief executive officer was as set forth below: On that basis, the Compensation Committee approved payments to these named executive officers in the amounts shown in the rightmost column. Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-end The following table sets forth as of December 31, 2018 the number of unexercised options held by each of the named executive officers, the number of shares subject to then exercisable and unexercisable options held by such persons and the exercise price and expiration date of each such option. Each option referred to in the table was granted at an option price per share no less than the fair market value per share on the date of grant. None of such individuals holds a stock award; accordingly, only information concerning option awards is presented. Option expiration date Option Exercises in Last Fiscal Year Four of the five named executive officers exercised stock options during 2018. The table below shows the realized value and the number of options exercised for those four individuals. None of our officers hold stock awards; accordingly, no stock awards vested during 2018. Option Exercises and Stock Vested Executive Management Bonus Plan (Non-equity Incentive Plan) The salary and cash bonus of the named executive officers are determined by the Compensation Committee. The compensation appearing in the Summary Compensation Table above under the caption ""Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation"" is paid pursuant to an executive management bonus plan (the “EMB Plan”). The EMB Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. Among other things, the Compensation Committee selects participants in the EMB Plan from among the Company’s executive officers and determines the performance goals, target amounts and other terms and conditions of awards under the EMB Plan. With respect to officers other than the chief executive officer, determinations of base salary and of criteria relating to the EMB Plan are based in part on evaluations of such officers prepared by the chief executive officer, which are furnished to and discussed with the Compensation Committee. Director Compensation Throughout 2018, we paid our non-employee directors a retainer of $5,167 per month, with an additional fee of $500 per month for service on a board committee ($1,000 for a committee chairman). Non-employee directors also received per diem fees of $1,000 for attendance in person at meetings of the board of directors, or $500 for attendance by telephone. No per diem fees are paid for attendance at committee meetings. The Board in 2018 approved issuance to each non-employee director of options to purchase as little as 30,000 shares or as much as 60,000 shares. The exercise prices of all such options are the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, which was $3.48 per share.The following table summarizes compensation received by our directors for the year 2018: (1) This column reports cash compensation earned in 2018 for Board and committee service. (2) This column represents the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes with respect to the 2018 fiscal year for the fair value of stock options granted to the directors in 2018. The fair value was estimated using a binomial option-pricing model in accordance with SFAS 123R. The fair value per option was $0.90, based on assumptions of 3.24 years expected life, expected volatility of 31.47%, expected dividend yield of 0.0%, and a risk-free rate of 2.68%. In addition to the stock option awards granted in 2018, our directors held at December 31, 2018 option awards granted in previous years. The total options held at December 31, 2018 represent the right to purchase shares as follows: Mr. Bradley, 3,369,999 shares; Mr. Adams, 270,000 shares; Mr. Rayhill, 417,000 shares; Mr. Roberts, 120,000 shares; Mr. Washer, 270,000 shares; and Mr. Wood, 285,000 shares. (3) Mr. Bradley's compensation as chief executive officer of the Company is described elsewhere in this report. He received no additional compensation for service on the Company's Board of Directors. Pension Plans The Company's officers do not participate in any pension or retirement plan, other than a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (commonly known as a 401(k) plan). Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control This section provides information regarding payments and benefits to the named executive officers that would be triggered by termination of the officer’s employment (including resignation, or voluntary termination; severance, or involuntary termination; and retirement) or a change of control of the Company. Each of the named executive officers is an at-will employee and, as such, does not have an employment contract. In addition, if the officer’s employment terminates for any reason other than a change of control of the Company, any unvested stock options are terminated, and vested options become subject to accelerated expiration: ordinarily three months following separation from service, or twelve months in the case of disability, retirement or death. Accordingly, there are no payments or benefits that are triggered by any termination event (including resignation and severance) other than in connection with a change of control of the Company. Benefits Triggered by Change of Control or Termination after Change of Control Our stock option plans provide that each employee of ours who holds outstanding unexpired options under our stock option may have the right to exercise such options following a change of control of the Company, without regard to the date such option would first be exercisable. Each of the named executive officers holds such options. The “acceleration” of options is mandatory following certain changes of control, and subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee following certain others. Acceleration is mandatory in the event of (i) the sale, or other disposition of substantially all of the Company’s assets, or (ii) a merger or similar transaction in which shareholders of the Company hold less than 50% of the shares of the surviving entity; provided, however, that acceleration following a merger or similar transaction is mandatory only if the holder suffers a Qualifying Termination (defined below) within one year following the transaction, or if the surviving entity does not provide the holder with an equivalent award. Acceleration is also mandatory if a holder suffers a Qualifying Termination within one year following (iii) a change within a three-year period in the membership of a majority of the board of directors (excluding changes recommended by the board), or (iv) a person’s acquisition of outstanding voting securities of the Company, other than directly from the Company and without approval of the board, resulting in that person’s having beneficial ownership of greater than 25% of the Company. Under our stock option plans, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion to provide for acceleration under other circumstances than those described above with respect to any particular stock option or class of stock options. The committee would expect to exercise its discretion with the intention of preserving the value of the stock option award. To date, such discretion has not been exercised. A “Qualifying Termination” is a termination of the holder’s employment by the Company other than for cause, disability or death, or by the holder for “good reason” (principally relating to a material diminution in the holder’s authority, compensation or responsibilities, or a relocation of greater than 50 miles). The preceding description applies to options held by officers and employees. Options issued to non-employee directors accelerate without the exercise of discretion upon any of the four categories of change of control described above. As of December 31, 2018, no named executive officers would realize a benefit if unvested stock options were to become immediately exercisable upon a change in control, based on the value of the shares underlying such options at the closing market price on December 31, 2018, which closing price was $3.01 per share). Management Structure The board of directors is responsible for overseeing the management of the Company. Its oversight is aimed at seeing to it that the company’s business is managed to meet our goals, and that the interests of the shareholders are served. Charles E. Bradley currently serves as both the chairman of the board and our chief executive officer, and is the only member of our board who is not independent of the Company. Largely because of the small number of directors (six members in total), our board has chosen not to designate any individual formally as the lead independent director. Each director retains his full oversight responsibility. Our board structure supports the independence of our non-management directors. Our audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee are each composed solely of independent directors. Our bylaws provide that any two directors have the authority to call meetings of the board of directors, as do specified officers, including the president and the secretary. To enhance the possible use of that authority by independent directors, the corporate secretary is under standing instructions to call a meeting at the instance of any one director. The board believes that combining the chairman and chief executive officer positions is currently the most effective leadership structure given Mr. Bradley’s in-depth knowledge of our business and industry and his demonstrated ability to formulate and implement strategic initiatives. Mr. Bradley is continuously involved in developing and implementing our strategies, working closely with the company’s other senior executives to seek continued disciplined growth and excellence in operations. His close involvement in management places Mr. Bradley in the best position to decide which business issues require consideration by the independent directors of the board. In addition, having a combined chairman and chief executive officer enables us to speak with a unified voice to shareholders, customers and others concerned with our company. The board believes that combining the chief executive and chairman roles, as part of a governance structure that includes oversight of management responsibilities by independent directors, provides the preferred system for meeting the requirement that the Company be managed in the best interest of our shareholders. Risk Oversight The board’s overall responsibility for directing the management of the company includes risk oversight. The risk oversight function is performed at the board level, and by the Audit and Compensation Committees. The board of directors as a whole in its regular meetings discusses and considers the risk inherent in the existing business of the Company and in proposed initiatives. Because the Company’s business consists of extending consumer credit to individuals believed to be of higher risk than others (sub-prime credit), the assessment of the risk assumed in such extensions of credit is a primary consideration on the part of the board. Risk oversight is also a key function of the Audit and Compensation Committees. The principal risk management function performed by the Audit Committee is the ongoing assessment of the credit estimates and allowances periodically recorded in the Company’s books. The committee reviews that assessment regularly. Other risk assessments performed by the Audit Committee include assessments of contingent liabilities, and of other reserves and allowances. The principal risk management functions performed by the Compensation Committee are its setting and evaluation of objectives for the chief executive officer, in connection with its administration of the executive management bonus plan. The committee recognizes that the company’s business of extending subprime credit inherently includes a conflict between growing the business and managing the risk of credit losses: one means to increase the company’s business is to offer credit on terms that are priced too low for the risk assumed. The Compensation Committee manages that risk by insisting that objectives to grow the business are qualified by a mandate that credit quality be maintained at appropriate levels. To some extent, such risk management is shared with the Audit Committee, which performs the primary oversight of whether credit risk assumed is reflected with adequate allowances in the company’s financial statements. Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters. The table below sets forth the number and percentage of shares of the our Common Stock (our only class of voting securities) owned beneficially as of April 29, 2019 (the latest practicable date) by (i) each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) each director and each named executive officer, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers, as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, and subject to applicable community property and similar laws, each of the persons named has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown as beneficially owned by such persons. Percent of class is calculated by reference to 22,149,142 shares outstanding on April 29, 2019. Except as otherwise noted, each person named in the table has a mailing address at 3800 Howard Hughes Parkway, Suite 1400, Las Vegas, Nevada 89169. Name and Address of Beneficial Owner Equity Compensation Plan Information The table below presents inform a tion regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans, including the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2018. CEO Pay Ratio The Dodd-Frank Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes a mandate that public companies disclose the ratio of the compensation of their CEO to their median employee. Our CEO-median employee pay ratio calculation for 2018 is 86:1. We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2018 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2018 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. There have been no changes to our employee population or compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change in the pay ratio. Accordingly, we have computed the ratio by reference to the same employee whom we identified as our median employee for the year 2017, who was determined using the compensation of employees who were actively employed on December 31, 2017. The total compensation of our median employee in 2018, using the same methodology we use for Mr. Bradley’s Summary Compensation Table compensation, was $46,710. The total compensation of the CEO Charles Bradley in 2018 was $4,022,600. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Citigroup. On July 10, 2008, CPS and its wholly owned subsidiary Folio Funding II, LLC, as borrower, agreed with Citigroup Financial Products Inc. (“CGFP”), an affiliate of Citigroup Inc. (“Citigroup”), to amend and restate the agreements governing a pre-existing revolving residual credit facility. CGFP was the note purchaser in and administrative agent of that credit facility. The amendments included the issuance to an affiliate of CGFP of a ten-year warrant to purchase (for nominal consideration) 2,500,000 shares of Company common stock, which warrant was subsequently transferred to CGFP. Upon issuance of such warrant, CGFP became a person with beneficial ownership of greater than 5% of the Company’s common stock. On March 10, 2010, the Company repurchased a portion of the warrant, representing 500,000 of the 2,500,000 shares available for purchase upon exercise of such warrant. On July 10, 2018, CGFP exercised the remaining warrant, receiving 1,999,995 shares after surrender of shares equal in value to the nominal exercise price. In September 2011, and approximately quarterly thereafter, CGMI acted as a placement agent of asset-backed notes issued by securitization trusts sponsored by CPS. The issuances of investment-grade and below investment-grade notes, and the placement compensation to CGMI, from January 1, 2016 to the present, are set forth in the table below. In each case, one or more other placement agents also received compensation for placing such notes, as well as CGMI. On May 11, 2012, the Company entered into a one-year revolving credit agreement (the ""Citi Warehouse Agreement"") and related agreements with affiliates of Citigroup and others, under which the lenders have agreed to lend up to a maximum of $100 million, to be secured by automobile receivables. In connection with the Citi Warehouse Agreement, the Company paid a closing fee of $1,000,000. The Company first incurred indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement in the amount of $9.1 million on May 14, 2012. The Company used the proceeds of that draw for working capital. Following earlier extensions in 2013, 2014 and 2016, the Company and the lenders agreed on September 21, 2018 to extend the revolving term of the Citi Warehouse Agreement to September 21, 2020. At the conclusion of the revolving period, at the election of either the borrower or the lender, the loans are to amortize for an additional one year, and then become due in full. Loans under the Citi Warehouse Agreement bear interest during the revolving period at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.00%, but in all events no less than 3.75% per year, and during the amortization period (if any) at a floating rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 4.00%, but in all events no less than 4.75% per year. The loans are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default. In connection with the 2018 renewal of the Citi Warehouse Agreement, we paid a closing fee of $730,000. The maximum principal amount of indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement during 2018 was $99.9 million. During 2018, the Company paid $357.9 million of principal and $1.9 million of interest on such debt. As of April 26, 2019, the principal amount owed was $22.3 million. The Company intends to incur additional indebtedness under the Citi Warehouse Agreement from time to time as it purchases motor vehicle receivables from dealers CPS Leasing. The Company holds 80% of the outstanding shares of the capital stock of CPS Leasing, Inc. (""CPSL""). The remaining 20% of CPSL is held by Charles E. Bradley, Jr., who is the chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors of the Company. CPSL engaged in the equipment leasing business, and is currently in the process of liquidation as its leases come to term. The Company financed the operations of CPSL by making operating advances and by advancing to CPSL the fraction of the purchase prices of its leased equipment that CPSL did not borrow under its lines of credit. The aggregate amounts of the advances made by the Company and outstanding to CPSL as of December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, were approximately $227,000, $186,000 and$153,000, respectively. Subordinated Notes . Director William Roberts on December 3, 2007 purchased $4,000,000 of unsecured subordinated three-year notes directly from the Company. The interest rate was determined by negotiation, and Mr. Roberts and the Company have agreed to a series of successive extensions of such indebtedness, with interest paid at 10% per annum throughout the years 2016 through 2018. The Company in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 paid interest of $400,000 per year on such notes, in accordance with those terms. The Company repaid the notes in full on February 1, 2019. Policy on Related Party Transactions and Director Independence. The agreements and transactions described above, other than those described under the caption “Citigroup,” were entered into by the Company with parties who personally benefited from such transactions and who had a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company. It is the Company's policy that any such transactions with persons having a control or fiduciary relationship with the Company may take place only if approved by the Audit Committee or by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who are disinterested with respect to the transaction, and independent in accordance with the standards for director independence prescribed by Nasdaq. Such policy is maintained in writing in the charter of the Audit Committee. The agreements and transactions above were reviewed and approved by the members of the Company's Board of Directors who were disinterested with respect to the transaction, except that the subordinated notes transaction was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. The six directors of the Company are Charles E. Bradley, Jr., Chris A. Adams, Brian J. Rayhill, William B. Roberts, Gregory S. Washer, and Daniel S. Wood, of whom Messrs. Wood, Rayhill and Washer compose the Audit Committee. The Board of Directors has concluded that other than Mr. Bradley (who is the Company's chief executive officer), each of the other five directors is independent in accordance with the director independence standards prescribed by Nasdaq, and has determined that none of them has a material relationship with the Company that would impair his independence from management or otherwise compromise his ability to act as an independent director. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services Fees Paid to Auditors The following table sets forth the fees accrued or paid to the Company’s independent registered public accounting firms for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Crowe has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since February 2009, and reported on the Company’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2018. (1) Audit fees relate to professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the Company’s annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, quarterly review of financial statements included in the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and audit services provided in connection with other statutory and regulatory filings. (2) Audit-related fees comprise fees for professional services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements. (3) The 2018 and 2017 tax fees represent services rendered in connection with preparation of state and federal tax returns for the Company and its subsidiaries. Audit Committee Supervision of Principal Accountant The Audit Committee acts pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. Pursuant to the charter, the Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and permitted non-audit fees to be paid to the independent auditor, and authorizes on behalf of the Company the payment of such fees, or refuses such authorization. The Audit Committee has delegated to its chairman and its vice-chairman the authority to approve performance of services on an interim basis. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, all services for which audit fees or audit related fees were paid were preapproved by the Audit Committee as a whole, or pursuant to such delegated authority. In the course of its meetings, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit fees outlined above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the respective audit firms, and has concluded that such independence is not and was not impaired.

Business Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our primary business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions. We also offer financing directly to sub-prime consumers to facilitate their purchase of a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts"" and all such purchases or acquisitions as “originations” or “acquisitions”. We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. We consist of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, “we,” “us,” “CPS” or “the Company”). From inception through December 31, 2018, we have purchased a total of approximately $15.2 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently in September 2011. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2018 are shown in the table below. Managed portfolio comprises both contracts we owned and those we were servicing for non-affiliates. Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The majority of our contract acquisitions volume results from our purchases of retail installment sales contracts from franchised or independent automobile dealers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee marketing representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our marketing representatives represent us exclusively. They may be located in our Irvine branch, in our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our marketing representatives present dealers with a marketing package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2018, we had 81 marketing representatives and in that month we received applications from 8,201 dealers in 46 states. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 74% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. We also solicit credit applications directly from prospective automobile consumers through the internet under a program we refer to as our direct lending platform. For qualified applicants we offer terms similar to those that we offer through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. Applicants approved in this fashion are free to shop for and purchase a vehicle from a dealer of their choosing, after which we enter into a note and security agreement directly with the consumer. During the year ended December 31, 2018 automobile contracts originated under the direct lending platform represented 2.8% of our total acquisitions and represented 1.6% of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Regardless of whether an automobile contract is originated from one of our dealers or through our direct lending platform, the discussion that follows regarding our acquisitions guidelines, procedures and demographic statistics applies to all of our originated contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 74% of the automobile contracts originated under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 26% consisted of financing for new cars, as compared to 75% financing for used cars and 25% for new cars in the year ended December 31, 2017. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of automobile contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 80 term securitizations of approximately $13.4 billion in automobile contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. As of December 31, 2018 we have three such short-term warehouse facilities, each with a maximum borrowing amount of $100 million. Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant’s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain. Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime, borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market. Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve. Contract Acquisitions When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer’s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. We also have a pass-through arrangement with another lender who sends us applications from their dealers in cases where that lender chooses not to approve those applications. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we received approximately 42% of all applications through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 38% through a pass-through arrangement we have with another lender, 16% via another aggregator, Route One and 4% via our website. Our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 99% of those applications. Upon receipt an application, if the application meets certain minimum criteria, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the automobile contract meets our underwriting criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. In some cases where we don’t grant an approval, we may suggest alternatives from the terms proposed by the dealer or request and review further information from the dealer. Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2018, no dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. Under our direct lending platform, the applicant submits a credit application directly to us via our website, or in some cases, through a third-party who accepts such applications and refers them to us for a fee. In either case, we order two credit reports and process the application with the same automated application decisioning process as described above for applications from dealers. We then advise the applicant as to whether or not we would grant them credit and on what terms. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we originated (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The following table sets forth the geographic concentrations of our outstanding managed portfolio as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on our purchased contracts for the periods shown: (1) Not applicable to direct lending platform Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and yield. We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined primarily by competition in the marketplace, which has increased over the periods presented, and also by our pricing strategy. The competitive environment in recent years has resulted in higher fees paid to dealers in conjunction with our contract acquisitions, compared to the years 2016 and earlier when dealers were generally paying us fees. This change in the marketplace has increased our capital requirements for acquiring contracts. We offer eight different financing programs, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the credit spectrum and are labeled as follows: Bravo - this program accommodates an applicant with significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. Advance rates are lowest of all of our programs to offset the greater risk. To offset the low up-front advance to the dealer, we agree to pay the dealer a portion of future payments we receive from the obligor, depending on loan performance. The Bravo program was introduced in November of 2015 and was terminated in November of 2018. First Time Buyer – This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Mercury / Delta – This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs. Standard – This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha – This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive. Alpha Plus – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program. Super Alpha – This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program. Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program. Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 79% of our new contract acquisitions in 2018, and 73% in 2017 and 2016, measured by aggregate amount financed. The following table identifies the credit program, sorted from highest to lowest credit quality, under which we originated automobile contracts during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we originate, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract in the event that the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations to us. Underwriting For automobile contracts that we purchase from dealers, we require that the contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. Under our direct lending platform, we require the customer to sign a note and security agreement. In each case, the contract is secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our underwriting criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle. We believe that our underwriting criteria enable us to evaluate effectively the creditworthiness of sub-prime customers and the adequacy of the financed vehicle as security for an automobile contract. The underwriting criteria include standards for price, term, amount of down payment, installment payment and interest rate; mileage, age and type of vehicle; principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle; customer income level, employment and residence stability, credit history and debt service ability, as well as other factors. Specifically, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a product to supplement the customer’s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have in excess of 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 72 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our underwriters verify the customer's employment, income, residency, insurance coverage, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this "" welcome call, "" we also ask the customer a series of open ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations. Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign each automobile contract two internal ""credit scores"" at the time the application is received and the customer's credit information is retrieved from the credit reporting agencies. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether or not we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer either to the dealer, or in the case of our direct lending platform, directly to the customer. Our internal credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including the customer's credit history, data derived from alternative sources such as utilities, telecom, and social media, length of employment, residence stability and total income. Once a vehicle is selected by the customer and a proposed deal structure is provided to us, our scores will then consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount, loan to value and the make and mileage of the vehicle. We have developed our credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market. Characteristics of Contracts. All of the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The table below compares certain characteristics, at the time of origination, of our contract purchases for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer in an attempt to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract. Servicing and Collection We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts that are included in portfolios that we have sold in securitizations or service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; collecting, accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; investigating delinquencies; communicating with the customer to obtain timely payments; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. We are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts in the securitization pools . The servicing fee is included in interest income for contracts that are pledged to a warehouse credit facility or a securitization transaction. Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers. We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 20 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our assessment of the customer’s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. If a customer has authorized us to do so, we may also send automated text message reminders at various stages of delinquency and our collectors may also choose to contact a customer via text message instead of, or in addition to, via telephone. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector will attempt to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to a collector’s queue for subsequent contacts. If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we will stop accruing interest on this automobile contract, and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition we will apply a specific reserve to this automobile contract so that the net balance represents the estimated fair value less costs to sell. If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent national repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. Upon recovery it stored until it is picked up by a wholesale auction that we designate, where it is kept until sold. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts. Once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower that are greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds. Credit Experience Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 23 months, 21 months and 18 months as of December 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. In addition, in June 2014 we became subject to a consent decree that required that we implement procedural changes in our servicing practices, which changes may have contributed to somewhat higher delinquencies, extensions and net losses compared to prior periods. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we were servicing as of the respective dates shown. The tables do not include the experience of third party servicing portfolios, because we do not bear the credit risk on such portfolios. Delinquency, Repossession and Extension Experience Delinquency and Extension Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio Net Credit Loss Experience (1) Total Owned Portfolio Extensions In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor will not be permitted more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date, generally by one month, though in some cases we may permit a longer extension, and in any case an advance in the maturity date corresponding to the advance of the due date. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor’s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. In most cases, the extension will be granted in conjunction with our receiving a past due payment or partial payment from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and psychological commitment to the contract on the obligor’s part. The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector’s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor’s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs.We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2018, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2017: We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off at December 31, 2018 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, the account may have defaulted and we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue. For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, in spite of the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received. Additional information about our extensions is provided in the tables below: Non-Accrual Receivables It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, for contracts originated prior to January 2018 that are not accounted for under the fair value method, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due. If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor’s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account. Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current). Securitization of Automobile Contracts Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For these receivables, we recognize interest income on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. We do not record an expense for provision for credit losses on these receivables because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield. Since 1994 we have conducted 80 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2018, 19 of those securitizations are active and all are structured as secured financings. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. In recent years, we have found that the securitizations we conducted in December of those years, had a tendency toward less investor demand in the related bonds than the securitizations we conducted in other times of the year. As a result, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since then have conducted our securitizations near the beginning of each calendar quarter. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Recent Asset-Backed Securitizations From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract acquisitions primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, and adding an amortization period through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to February 2023. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017, extending the revolving period to November 2019, followed by an amortization period to November 2021. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with all such covenants. Competition The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer’s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Regulation Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was enacted in July 2010, and many of its provisions became effective in July 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over “non-banks,” including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. Further, the CFPB has general supervisory and examination authority over non-depository “larger participants” in the market for automotive finance companies. We are subject to such supervision and examination. The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time. In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,032 employees. The breakdown of the employees is as follows: 10 were senior management personnel; 610 were servicing personnel; 215 were automobile contract origination personnel; 132 were marketing personnel and program development (81 of whom were marketing representatives); 65 were various administration personnel including human resources, legal, accounting and systems. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of the following specific risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and other industry risks. This listing of risks by its nature cannot be exhaustive, and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance. In addition to the risks described below, we may encounter risks that we do not currently recognize or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business operations and the value of our common stock. Risks Related to Our Business We Require a Substantial Amount of Cash to Service Our Substantial Debt. To service our existing substantial indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, including our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation: Depending upon the outcome of one or more of these factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain sufficient funding to satisfy all of our obligations. Such factors may result in our being unable to pay our debts timely or as agreed. If we were unable to pay our debts, we would be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional equity capital. These alternative strategies might not be feasible at the time, might prove inadequate, or could require the prior consent of our lenders. If executed, these strategies could reduce the earnings available to our shareholders. We Need Substantial Liquidity to Operate Our Business. We have historically funded our operations principally through internally generated cash flows, sales of debt and equity securities, including through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, borrowings under senior secured debt agreements and sales of subordinated notes. However, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding for our future operations from such sources. During 2008, 2009 and much of 2010, our access to the capital markets was impaired with respect to both short-term and long-term funding. While our access to such funding has improved since then, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected. We require a substantial amount of cash liquidity to operate our business. Among other things, we use such cash liquidity to: Historically we have matched our liquidity needs to our available sources of funding by reducing our acquisition of new automobile contracts, at times to merely nominal levels. There can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful with that strategy. Periods of Significant Losses. From time to time throughout our history we have incurred net losses, most recently over the period beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2008 and ending with the quarter ended September 30, 2011. We were adversely affected by the economic recession affecting the United States as a whole, for a time by increased financing costs and decreased availability of capital to fund our purchases of automobile contracts, and by a decrease in the overall level of sales of automobiles and light trucks. Similar periods of losses began in the quarter ended March 31, 1999 through the quarter ended December 31, 2000 and also from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 through the quarter ended March 31, 2005. We expect to earn quarterly profits during 2019; however, there can be no assurance as to that expectation. Our expectation of profitability is a forward-looking statement. We discuss the assumptions underlying that expectation under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements” in this report. We identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ, generally in the “Risk Factors” section of this report, and also under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” One reason for our expectation is that we have had positive net income in each of the seven years fiscal ended December 31, 2018, although not in every quarter within that period. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Secure and Maintain Adequate Credit and Warehouse Financing on Favorable Terms. Our business strategy requires that warehouse credit facilities be available in order to purchase significant volumes of receivables. Historically, our primary sources of day-to-day liquidity have been our warehouse credit facilities, in which we sell and contribute automobile contracts, as often as twice a week, to special-purpose subsidiaries, where they are ""warehoused"" until they are financed on a long-term basis through the issuance and sale of asset-backed notes. Upon sale of the notes, funds advanced under one or more warehouse credit facilities are repaid from the proceeds. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities, each with a maximum credit limit of $100 million. Each of the three warehouse credit facilities includes a revolving period during which we may receive advances secured by contributed automobile contracts, followed by an amortization period during which no further advances may be made, but prior to which outstanding advances are due and payable. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Liquidity”. If we are unable to maintain warehouse financing on acceptable terms, we might curtail or cease our purchases of new automobile contracts, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Our Ability to Securitize Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts. We depend upon our ability to obtain permanent financing for pools of automobile contracts by conducting term securitization transactions. By ""permanent financing"" we mean financing that extends to cover the full term during which the underlying automobile contracts are outstanding and requires repayment as the underlying automobile contracts are repaid or charged off. By contrast, our warehouse credit facilities permit us to borrow against the value of such receivables only for limited periods of time. Our past practice and future plan has been and is to repay loans made to us under our warehouse credit facilities with the proceeds of securitizations. There can be no assurance that any securitization transaction will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. The timing of any securitization transaction is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, any of which could cause substantial delays, including, without limitation: During 2008 and 2009 we observed adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts, which made permanent financing in the form of securitization transactions difficult to obtain and more costly than in prior periods. These changes included reduced liquidity and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty or for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Although we have seen improvements in the capital markets from 2010 and thereafter, as compared to 2008 and 2009, if the market conditions for asset-backed securitizations should reverse, we could expect a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our Results of Operations Will Depend on Cash Flows from Our Residual Interests in Our Securitization Program and Our Warehouse Credit Facilities. When we finance our automobile contracts through securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, we receive cash and retain a residual interest in the assets financed. Those financed assets are owned by the special-purpose subsidiary that is formed for the related securitization. This residual interest represents the right to receive the future cash flows to be generated by the automobile contracts in excess of (i) the interest and principal paid to investors or lenders on the indebtedness issued in connection with the financing, (ii) the costs of servicing the automobile contracts and (iii) certain other costs incurred in connection with completing and maintaining the securitization or warehouse credit facility. We sometimes refer to these future cash flows as ""excess spread cash flows."" Under the financial structures we have used to date in our securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, excess spread cash flows that would otherwise be paid to the holder of the residual interest are first used to increase overcollateralization or are retained in a spread account within the securitization trusts or the warehouse facility to provide liquidity and credit enhancement for the related securities. While the specific terms and mechanics vary among transactions, our securitization and warehousing agreements generally provide that we will receive excess spread cash flows only if the amount of overcollateralization and spread account balances have reached specified levels and/or the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the automobile contract pools are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on automobile contracts exceed these levels, the terms of the securitization or warehouse credit facility: We typically retain residual interests or use them as collateral to borrow cash. In any case, the future excess spread cash flow received in respect of the residual interests is integral to the financing of our operations. The amount of cash received from residual interests depends in large part on how well our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts performs. If our portfolio of securitized and warehoused automobile contracts has higher delinquency and loss ratios than expected, then the amount of money realized from our retained residual interests, or the amount of money we could obtain from the sale or other financing of our residual interests, would be reduced. Such higher than expected losses occurred in 2008 through 2010, which had an adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and cash flows. Should significant increases in losses reoccur, such recurrence might have material adverse effects on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If We Are Unable to Obtain Credit Enhancement for Our Securitizations Upon Favorable Terms, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. In our securitizations from 1994 through 2008, we utilized credit enhancement in the form of one or more financial guaranty insurance policies issued by financial guaranty insurance companies. Each of these policies unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed timely interest and ultimate principal payments on the senior classes of the securities issued in those securitizations. These guarantees enabled those securities to achieve the highest credit rating available. This form of credit enhancement reduced the costs of our securitizations relative to alternative forms of credit enhancement available to us at the time. Due to significantly reduced investor demand for securities carrying such a financial guaranty, this form of credit enhancement may not be economical for us in the future. The 31 securitization transactions we executed from 2010 through 2018 did not utilize financial guaranty insurance policies. Prior to the second quarter of 2014, none of the securities issued in those transactions received the highest possible credit rating from any rating agency. As we pursue future securitizations, we may not be able to obtain: The credit spread between the interest rates payable on our securitization trust debt and the rates payable on risk-free investments has varied. As of the date of this report, it is the consensus of market observers that interest rates on risk-free debt will rise within the next year. If interest rates on risk-free debt do increase, or if our spread above risk-free rates should increase, or both, we would expect increased interest expense, which would adversely affect our results of operations. If We Are Unable to Compete Successfully with our Competitors, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as commercial banks, savings and loan associations, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers, such as Ford Motor Credit Company, LLC and General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than we do, including greater access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade rated debt instruments, and to other funding sources which may be unavailable to us. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital relative to that of our competitors. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with automobile dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchases of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully and, as a result, we may not be able to purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price acceptable to us, which could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If Our Dealers Do Not Submit a Sufficient Number of Suitable Automobile Contracts to Us for Purchase, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent upon establishing and maintaining relationships with a large number of unaffiliated automobile dealers to supply us with automobile contracts. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no single dealer accounted for as much as 1% of the automobile contracts we purchased. The agreements we have with dealers to purchase automobile contracts do not require dealers to submit a minimum number of automobile contracts for purchase. The failure of dealers to submit automobile contracts that meet our underwriting criteria could result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us, and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. If a Significant Number of Our Automobile Contracts Experience Defaults, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We specialize in the purchase and servicing of automobile contracts to finance automobile purchases by sub-prime customers, those who have limited credit history, low income, or past credit problems. Such automobile contracts entail a higher risk of non-performance, higher delinquencies and higher losses than automobile contracts with more creditworthy customers. While we believe that our pricing of the automobile contracts and the underwriting criteria and collection methods we employ enable us to control, to a degree, the higher risks inherent in automobile contracts with sub-prime customers, no assurance can be given that such pricing, criteria and methods will afford adequate protection against such risks. If automobile contracts that we purchase and hold experience defaults to a greater extent than we have anticipated, this could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, depend, to a material extent, on the performance of automobile contracts that we purchase, warehouse and securitize. A portion of the automobile contracts that we acquire will default or prepay. In the event of payment default, the collateral value of the vehicle securing an automobile contract realized by us in a repossession will generally not cover the outstanding principal balance on that automobile contract and the related costs of recovery. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on automobile contracts held on our balance sheet, which reflects our estimates of probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated for securitizations that are accounted for as financings and warehoused automobile contracts. If the allowance is inadequate, then we would recognize the losses in excess of the allowance as an expense and our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, under the terms of our warehouse credit facilities, we are not able to borrow against defaulted automobile contracts, including automobile contracts that are, at the time of default, funded under our warehouse credit facilities, which will reduce the overcollateralization of those warehouse credit facilities and possibly reduce the amount of cash flows available to us. If We Lose Servicing Rights on Our Portfolio of Automobile Contracts, Our Results of Operations Would Be Impaired. We are entitled to receive servicing fees only while we act as servicer under the applicable sale and servicing agreements governing our warehouse credit facilities and securitizations. Under such agreements, we may be terminated as servicer upon the occurrence of certain events, including: The loss of our servicing rights could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow, would be materially and adversely affected if we were to be terminated as servicer with respect to a material portion of our managed portfolio. If We Lose Key Personnel, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our senior management team averages over 20 years of service with us. Charles E. Bradley, Jr., our President and CEO, has been our President since our formation in 1991. Our future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued service of our key senior management personnel, none of whom is bound by an employment agreement. Our future operating results also depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, sales and support personnel for our operations. Competition for such personnel is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. Conversely, adverse general economic conditions may have had a countervailing effect. The loss of any key employee, the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees, as needed, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. If We Fail to Comply with Regulations, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Failure to materially comply with all laws and regulations applicable to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Our business is subject to numerous federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations, which, among other things: Our industry is also at times investigated by regulators and offices of state attorneys general, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties, or the assertion of private claims and law suits against us. The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has the authority to investigate consumer complaints against us, to conduct inquiries at its own instance, and to recommend enforcement actions and seek monetary penalties. The FTC has conducted and concluded an inquiry into our practices, and proposed remedial action against us in 2014, to which we consented. The CFPB has adopted regulations that place us and other companies similar to us under its supervision. Our industry has also been under investigation by the United States Department of Justice, which has conducted and may continue to conduct an inquiry that appears to be focused on securitization practices. In that inquiry, we received a subpoena in January 2015, which required that we produce specified documents. We have been advised by the Department of Justice that we have provided such information as is required, and that no enforcement action against us is recommended. Although the inquiry commenced January 2015 is thus completed as to us, no assurance can be given as to whether some other government agency may commence inquiries into or actions against us, nor as to whether the DOJ may recommence its investigation, any of which hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such failure could result in penalties, litigation losses and expenses, damage to our reputation, or the suspension or termination of our licenses to conduct business, which would materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and stock price. In addition, new federal and state laws or regulations or changes in the ways that existing rules or laws are interpreted or enforced could limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of compliance. Furthermore, judges or regulatory bodies could interpret current rules or laws differently than the way we do, leading to such adverse consequences as described above. The resolution of such matters may require considerable time and expense, and if not resolved in our favor, may result in fines or damages, and possibly an adverse effect on our financial condition. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all such laws and regulations, and that such laws and regulations have had no material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business. However, we may be materially and adversely affected if we fail to comply with: Changes in Law and Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (""Dodd-Frank""), adopted in 2010, made numerous changes to the laws applicable to the consumer financial services industry. Among other things, Dodd-Frank created the CFPB, which is authorized to promulgate and enforce consumer protection regulations relating to financial products and mandated that other federal agencies adopt rules implementing risk retention requirements in securitizations. We are also subject to regulation by each state in which we operate, and such states’ laws and regulations, and the interpretations thereof, also change from time to time. Compliance with new laws and regulations may be or likely will be costly and can affect operating results. Compliance requires forms, processes, procedures, controls and the infrastructure to support these requirements. Compliance may create operational constraints and place limits on pricing. Laws in the financial services industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumers. The failure to comply could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalties, monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs, possible revocation of licenses and damage to reputation, brand and valued customer relationships. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which new regulations or amendments will affect our business. However, compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional cost and expenses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Risk Retention Rules May Limit Our Liquidity and Increase Our Capital Requirements. Securitizations of automobile receivables after December 2016 are subject to risk retention requirements, which generally require that sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS), such as us, retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the ABS issuance. The rule also sets forth prohibitions on transferring or hedging the credit risk that the sponsor is required to retain. Similar but not identical risk retention requirements are applicable after December 2018 to securitization transactions where purchasers of the ABS have sufficient contacts with the European Union. Because the rules place an upper limit on the degree to which we may use financial leverage in our securitization structures may require more capital of us, or may release less cash to us, than might be the case in the absence of such rules. If We Experience Unfavorable Litigation Results, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We operate in a litigious society and currently are, and may in the future be, named as defendants in litigation, including individual and class action lawsuits under consumer credit, consumer protection, theft, privacy, data security, automated dialing equipment, debt collections and other laws. Many of these cases present novel issues on which there is no clear legal precedent, which increases the difficulty in predicting both the potential outcomes and costs of defending these cases. We are subject to regulatory examinations, investigations, inquiries, litigation, and other actions by licensing authorities, state attorneys general, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other governmental bodies relating to our activities. The litigation and regulatory actions to which we are or may become subject involve or may involve potential compensatory or punitive damage claims, fines, sanctions or injunctive relief that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations. We have recorded loss contingencies in our financial statements only for matters on which losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our assessments of these matters involve significant judgments, and may change from time to time. Actual losses incurred by us in connection with judgments or settlements of these matters may be more than our associated reserves. Furthermore, defending lawsuits and responding to governmental inquiries or investigations, regardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention from the operation of our business. Unfavorable outcomes in any such current or future proceedings could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. As a consumer finance company, we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties based upon, among other things, disclosure inaccuracies and wrongful repossession, which could take the form of a plaintiff's class action complaint. We, as the assignee of finance contracts originated by dealers, may also be named as a co-defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealers. We are also subject to other litigation common to the automobile industry and to businesses in general. The damages and penalties claimed by consumers and others in these types of matters can be substantial. The relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory, statutory and punitive damages. While we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against such proceedings, there is a chance that our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes. Negative publicity associated with litigation, governmental investigations, regulatory actions, and other public statements could damage our reputation. From time to time there are negative news stories about the “sub-prime” credit industry. Such stories may follow the announcements of litigation or regulatory actions involving us or others in our industry. Negative publicity about our alleged or actual practices or about our industry generally could adversely affect our stock price and our ability to retain and attract employees. If We Experience Problems with Our Originations, Accounting or Collection Systems, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. We are dependent on our receivables originations, accounting and collection systems to service our portfolio of automobile contracts. Such systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks, computer viruses and other events. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Our systems are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism by internal employees and contractors as well as third parties. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures. Such systems problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. A breach in the security of our systems could result in the disclosure of confidential information or subject us to liability We hold in our systems confidential financial and other personal data with respect to our customers, which may be of value to identity thieves and others if revealed. Although we endeavor to protect the security of our computer systems and the confidentiality of customer information entrusted to us, there can be no assurance that our security measures will provide adequate security. It is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Company such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations. Such persons may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands our use of web-based products and applications. A successful penetration of the security of our systems could cause serious negative consequences, including disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us. We Have Substantial Indebtedness. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2,256.9 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,063.6 million of securitization trust debt, $136.8 million of warehouse lines of credit, $39.1 million of residual interest financing debt and $17.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition by, among other things: Although we believe we are able to service and repay such debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we do not generate sufficient operating profits, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due would give rise to various remedies in favor of any unpaid creditors, and creditors’ exercise of such remedies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Because We Are Subject to Many Restrictions in Our Existing Credit Facilities and Securitization Transactions, Our Ability to Pay Dividends or Engage in Specified Transactions May Be Impaired. The terms of our existing credit facilities, term securitizations and our other outstanding debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests. These restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business activities, results of operations and financial condition. These restrictions may also significantly limit or prohibit us from engaging in certain transactions, including the following: These restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of capital, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. In addition, the failure to comply with any of the covenants of one or more of our debt agreements could cause a default under other debt agreements that may be outstanding from time to time. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness, in which case such debt would become immediately due and payable. A continuing default or acceleration of one or more of our credit facilities or any other debt agreement, would likely cause a default under other debt agreements that otherwise would not be in default, in which case all such related indebtedness could be accelerated. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness. Even if any new financing is available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or it may not be sufficient to refinance all of our indebtedness as it becomes due. In addition, the transaction documents for our securitizations restrict our securitization subsidiaries from declaring or making payment to us of (i) any dividend or other distribution on or in respect of any shares of their capital stock, or (ii) any payment on account of the purchase, redemption, retirement or acquisition of any option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of their capital stock unless (in each case) at the time of such declaration or payment (and after giving effect thereto) no amount payable under any transaction document with respect to the related securitization is then due and owing, but unpaid. These restrictions may limit our ability to receive distributions in respect of the residual interests from our securitization facilities, which may limit our ability to generate earnings. Risks Related to Fair Value Accounting Receivables we’ve acquired since January 1, 2018 are accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Interest Income We Recognize for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We recognize interest income on receivables accounted under fair value based on a level yield internal rate of return that we calculate based the terms of the receivables and our estimates [at the time of acquisition of the future performance of those receivables]. Such estimates include the timing and severity of future credit losses and the rates of amortization and of prepayments. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to change our estimates, which could result in a reduced interest income for those receivables in subsequent periods. If Actual Results for Our Receivables Materially Deviate from Our Estimates, We May Be Required to Reduce the Carrying Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. We re-evaluate the carrying value of receivables measured at fair value at the close of each quarter. If the re-evaluation were to yield a value materially different from the previous carrying value, an adjustment would be required. If actual credit losses were to exceed our estimates, or if the actual amortization and prepayments of the receivables were to be materially different from our estimates, we might be required to adjust the carrying value of such receivables. A downward readjustment in carrying value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value for and as of the end of the related quarter. If Actual Market Conditions Indicate That the Amount a Market Participant Would Pay for Our Receivables is Materially Lower Than Our Carrying Value, We May Be Required to Reduce the Carrying Value for Some or All of the Receivables Measured at Fair Value. The fair value of an asset is, by definition, the exchange price in an orderly transaction between market participants. Receivables such as ours are not regularly traded on exchanges where we can observe prices for exchanges of similar assets. We may therefore rely on estimates of what a market participant would pay for our receivables. If such estimated value were to be materially different from our carrying value, we might be required to adjust the carrying value of our receivables. A downward readjustment in carrying value would correspondingly reduce our income and book value. Risks Related to General Factors If The Economy of All or Certain Regions of the United States Falls into Recession, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our business is directly related to sales of new and used automobiles, which are sensitive to employment rates, prevailing interest rates and other domestic economic conditions. Delinquencies, repossessions and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. Because of our focus on sub-prime customers, the actual rates of delinquencies, repossessions and losses on our automobile contracts could be higher under adverse economic conditions than those experienced in the automobile finance industry in general, particularly in the states of California, Texas, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, states in which our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated. Any sustained period of economic slowdown or recession could adversely affect our ability to acquire suitable automobile contracts, or to securitize pools of such automobile contracts. The timing of any economic changes is uncertain, and weakness in the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and that of the dealers from which we purchase automobile contracts and result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired as a Result of Natural Disasters. Our automobile contracts are geographically concentrated in the states of California and Texas. Such states may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters: earthquake in the case of California, and hurricanes and flooding in Texas. Natural disasters, in those states or others, could cause a material number of our vehicle purchasers to lose their jobs, or could damage or destroy vehicles that secure our automobile contracts. In either case, such events could result in our receiving reduced collections on our automobile contracts, and could thus result in reductions in our revenues or the cash flows available to us. If an Increase in Interest Rates Results in a Decrease in Our Cash Flows from Excess Spread, Our Results of Operations May Be Impaired. Our profitability is largely determined by the difference, or ""spread,"" between the effective interest rate we receive on the automobile contracts that we acquire and the interest rates payable under warehouse credit facilities and on the asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations. In the past, disruptions in the market for asset-backed securities resulted in an increase in the interest rates we paid on asset-backed securities. Should similar disruptions take place in the future, we may pay higher interest rates on asset-backed securities issued in the future. Although we have the ability to partially offset increases in our cost of funds by increasing fees we charge to dealers when purchasing automobile contracts, or by demanding higher interest rates on automobile contracts we purchase, there is no assurance that such actions will materially offset increases in interest we pay to finance our managed portfolio. As a result, an increase in prevailing interest rates could cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk.” Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our Common Stock Is Thinly-Traded. Our stock is thinly-traded, which means investors will have limited opportunities to sell their shares of common stock in the open market. Limited trading of our common stock also contributes to more volatile price fluctuations. Because there historically has been low trading volume in our common stock, there can be no assurance that our stock price will not decline as additional shares are sold in the public market. As of December 31, 2018, our directors and executive officers collectively owned 5.1 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 24%. We Do Not Intend to Pay Dividends on Our Common Stock. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

See "" Where You Can Find More Information "" and "" Documents Incorporated by Reference. "" Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. Item 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where we currently lease approximately 45,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $1.5 million, increasing to approximately $1.7 million through 2022. Our operating headquarters are located in Irvine, California, where we currently lease approximately 129,000 square feet of general office space from an unaffiliated lessor. The annual base rent is approximately $4.0 million, increasing to approximately $4.5 million through 2022. The remaining three regional servicing centers occupy a total of approximately 59,000 square feet of leased space in Chesapeake, Virginia; Maitland, Florida; and Lombard, Illinois. The termination dates of such leases range from 2019 to 2025. The annual base rent for these facilities total approximately $1.4 million increasing to approximately $1.6 million through 2025. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our marketing representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . Department of Justice Industry Inquiry. In January 2015, we were served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) directing us to produce certain documents relating to our and our subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ origination and securitization of sub-prime automobile contracts since 2005, in connection with an investigation by the DOJ in contemplation of a civil proceeding for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ in its investigation requested information relating, among other matters, to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile contracts and to the representations and warranties relating to those underwriting criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile contracts. We are among several other securitizers of sub-prime automobile receivables who received such subpoenas in 2014, 2015 and 2016. We have provided the required information, and we were advised by the DOJ in February 2018 that no further information is required of us and that no enforcement action is recommended. Although the inquiry commenced January 2015 is thus completed as to us, no assurance can be given as to whether some other government agency may commence inquiries into or actions against us, nor as to whether the DOJ may recommence its investigation, any of which hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. In General . There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2018, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including each of the matters described or referenced above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2018 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2018 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, the wide discretion vested in the DOJ and other government agencies, and the deference that courts may give to assertions made by government litigants, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other information included or incorporated by reference herein. Overview We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories, low incomes or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also (i) acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, (ii) purchased immaterial amounts of vehicle purchase money loans from non-affiliated lenders, and (iii) directly originated an immaterial amount of vehicle purchase money loans by lending money directly to consumers. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as ""automobile contracts."" We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. From inception through December 31, 2018, we have originated a total of approximately $15.2 billion of automobile contracts, primarily by purchasing retail installment sales contracts from dealers, and to a lesser degree, by originating loans secured by automobiles directly with consumers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently, in September 2011. The September 2011 acquisition consisted of approximately $217.8 million of automobile contracts that we purchased from Fireside Bank of Pleasanton, California. In 2004 and 2009, we were appointed as a third-party servicer for certain portfolios of automobile contracts originated and owned by non-affiliated entities. Recent contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels are shown in the table below: Contracts Purchased in Period Managed Portfolio at Period End Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in that California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches. The programs we offer to dealers and consumers are intended to serve a wide range of sub-prime customers, primarily through franchised new car dealers. We originate automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours, which in turn issues asset-backed securities to fund the purchase of the pool of contracts from us. Securitization and Warehouse Credit Facilities Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings. When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts. Since 1994 we have conducted 80 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we originated. As of December 31, 2018, 19 of those securitizations are active, all of which are structured as secured financings. From 1994 through April 2008 we generally utilized financial guarantees for the senior asset-backed notes issued in the securitization. Since September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structures without any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. However, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016, and since that time have generally conducted our securitizations near the beginning of each calendar quarter. Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below: Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was most recently renewed in September 2018, extending the revolving period to September 2020, and adding an amortization period through September 2021. In April 2015, we entered into a second $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in April 2017 and again in February 2019, extending the revolving period to February 2021, followed by an amortization period to April 2023. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility. This facility was renewed in November 2017, extending the revolving period to November 2019, followed by an amortization period to November 2021. In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we will be obligated to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase. Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed. Critical Accounting Policies We believe that our accounting policies related to (a) Finance Receivables at Fair Value, (b) Allowance for Finance Credit Losses, (c) Amortization of Deferred Origination Costs and Acquisition Fees, (d) Term Securitizations, (e) Accrual for Contingent Liabilities and (f) Income Taxes are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Such policies are described below. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, prospective liquidation values of the underlying collateral and general economic and market conditions. As circumstances change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change as well. Receivables acquired after 2017, are accounted for using fair value and will have no allowance for finance credit losses in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The historical weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio including Finance Receivables at Fair Value, is summarized in the table below: The credit performance of our portfolio is also significantly influenced by our underwriting guidelines and credit criteria we use when evaluating contracts for purchase from dealers. We regularly evaluate our portfolio credit performance and modify our purchase criteria to maximize the credit performance of our portfolio, while maintaining competitive programs and levels of service for our dealers. We generally do not lower the contractual interest rate or waive or forgive principal when our borrowers incur financial difficulty on either a temporary or permanent basis. An exception to this policy is when a court order mandates the terms of the contract to be modified, such as in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. In such cases, which represent an immaterial portion of our portfolio of finance receivables, we have estimated the amount of impairment that results from such modification and established an appropriate allowance within our Allowance for Finance Credit Losses. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the carrying value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the carrying value, an adjustment would be required. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial carrying value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Amortization of Deferred Originations Costs and Acquisition Fees Upon purchase of a contract from a dealer, we generally either charge or advance the dealer an acquisition fee. In addition, we incur certain direct costs associated with acquisitions of our contracts. All such acquisition fees and direct costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the contract using the interest method. Receivables acquired after 2017 are accounted for using fair value. In accordance with the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables, any dealer acquisition fees will be incorporated into acquisition price of the receivables and no direct costs will be deferred. Term Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell automobile contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our automobile contracts. The special-purpose subsidiary then transfers the same automobile contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust. The trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities, in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the automobile contracts. We typically sell these automobile contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse, except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to us are provided by us to the trust. One or more investors purchase the asset-backed securities issued by the trust; the proceeds from the sale of the asset-backed securities are then used to purchase the automobile contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated asset-backed securities issued by the trust or by a related entity. We structure our securitizations to include internal credit enhancement for the benefit the investors (i) in the form of an initial cash deposit to an account ( "" spread account "" ) held by the trust, (ii) in the form of overcollateralization of the senior asset-backed securities, where the principal balance of the senior asset-backed securities issued is less than the principal balance of the automobile contracts, (iii) in the form of subordinated asset-backed securities, or (iv) some combination of such internal credit enhancements. The agreements governing the securitization transactions require that the initial level of internal credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the automobile contracts until the level of internal credit enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related automobile contracts. The specified levels at which the internal credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of automobile contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions, and may also be varied by agreement among us, our special purpose subsidiary, the insurance company, if any, and the trustee. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one transaction to another. The agreements governing the securitizations generally grant us the option to repurchase the sold automobile contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the automobile contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance. Upon each transfer of automobile contracts in a transaction structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes, we retain on our consolidated balance sheet the related automobile contracts as assets and record the asset-backed notes or loans issued in the transaction as indebtedness. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the automobile contracts. Under our securitization structures treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, such servicing fees are included in interest income from the automobile contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the automobile contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the asset-backed securities, base servicing fees, and certain other fees and expenses (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the asset-backed notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of such notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related automobile contracts (excluding those automobile contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the asset-backed securities is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the asset-backed notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, expenses, interest and principal on the senior asset-backed notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated asset-backed notes, and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or the required overcollateralization level, the excess is released to us. If the spread account and overcollateralization is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved. Although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of our special-purpose subsidiaries as the owner of the residual interests (in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes) or the trusts (in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes), we are restricted in use of the cash in the spread accounts. Cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the securitization agreements. The interest rate payable on the automobile contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the asset-backed notes. As a result, the residual interests described above historically have been a significant asset of ours. In all of our term securitizations and warehouse credit facilities, whether treated as secured financings or as sales, we have sold the automobile contracts (through a subsidiary) to the securitization entity. The difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings we report the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on our consolidated balance sheet. Under both structures, recourse to us by holders of the asset-backed securities and by the trust, for failure of the automobile contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis, is limited to the automobile contracts included in the securitizations or warehouse credit facilities, the spread accounts and our retained interests in the respective trusts. Accrual for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies at that date. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2018, and in excess of the liability we have recorded, does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies, after taking into account our current litigation reserves, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued; as a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. Income Taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgments, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) forecasted future net earnings from operations. Based upon those considerations, we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the U.S. and state net operating loss carryforward periods provide enough time to utilize the deferred tax assets pertaining to the existing net operating loss carryforwards and any net operating loss that would be created by the reversal of the future net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. Our estimates of taxable income are forward-looking statements, and there can be no assurance that our estimates of such taxable income will be correct. Factors discussed under ""Risk Factors,"" and in particular under the subheading ""Risk Factors -- Forward-Looking Statements"" may affect whether such projections prove to be correct. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets. Uncertainty of Capital Markets and General Economic Conditions We depend upon the availability of warehouse credit facilities and access to long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities collateralized by our automobile contracts. Since 1994, we have completed 80 term securitizations of approximately $13.4 billion in contracts. From the fourth quarter of 2007 through the end of 2009, we observed unprecedented adverse changes in the market for securitized pools of automobile contracts. These changes included reduced liquidity, and reduced demand for asset-backed securities, particularly for securities carrying a financial guaranty and for securities backed by sub-prime automobile receivables. Moreover, during that period many of the firms that previously provided financial guarantees, which were an integral part of our securitizations, suspended offering such guarantees. These adverse changes caused us to conserve liquidity by significantly reducing our purchases of automobile contracts. However, since September 2009 we have established new funding facilities and gradually increased our contract purchases and the frequency and amount of our term securitizations. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. Results of Operations Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the year ended December 31, 2017 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2018, our revenues were $389.8 million, a decrease of $44.6 million, or 10.3%, from the prior year revenues of $434.4 million. The primary reason for the decrease in revenues is a decrease in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $43.9 million, or 10.3%, to $380.3 million from $424.2 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the decrease in interest income is the lower interest yield on the receivables measured at fair value. The interest yield on receivables measured at fair value is reduced to take account of expected losses and is therefore less than the yield on other finance receivables. The table below shows the outstanding and average balances of our portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries for the year months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Other income decreased by $730,000, or 7.2%, to $9.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 from $10.2 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decrease of $600,000 in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers, and a decrease of $200,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries (other than our portfolio of finance receivables measured at fair value, as to which expected credit losses have the effect of reducing the interest rate applicable to such receivables). Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $371.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $402.3 million for the prior year, a decrease of $31.2 million, or 7.8%. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in provision for credit losses, offsetting increases in employee costs, interest expense, marketing and general and administrative expenses. Employee costs increased by $6.4 million or 8.7%, to $79.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, representing 21.4% of total operating expenses, from $73.0 million for the prior year, or 18.1% of total operating expenses. Employee costs for the prior year period were net of $5.4 million of direct employee costs associated with the originations of contracts during that period. Such deferred costs are then recognized over the life of the related receivables using the interest method. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2018 and 2017: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $31.0 million, an increase of $4.5 million, or 16.8%, compared to the previous year and represented 8.4% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $9.1 million to $101.5 million, or 9.9%, compared to $92.3 million in the previous year. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $6.8 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt decreased 1.5% to $2,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2,172.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the blended interest rates on our term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014. As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2018 was 4.2%, compared to 3.8% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization trust debt interest costs in 2018 compared to 2017. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 4.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.8% in the prior year. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on our subordinated debt increased by $117,000, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The increase was the result of an increase in the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes to 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 from 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was also the result of an increase in the average balance of the notes from $16.0 million in the prior year to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $2.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. There was no residual interest financing debt outstanding during 2017. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $181,000, or 2.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate on our warehouse credit line debt from 12.7% in 2017 to 11.6% in 2018. However, most of the decrease in interest expense was offset by higher utilization of our warehouse lines in 2018 compared to 2017. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Provision for credit losses was $133.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a decrease of $53.6 million, or 28.7% compared to the prior year and represented 35.9% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Finance receivables that we have originated since January 2018 are accounted for at fair value. Under the fair value method of accounting, we recognize interest income under the interest method on a level yield basis based on forecasted future cash flows net of expected credit losses. Thus, no provision for credit loss expense is recorded for finance receivables measured at fair value. This is the primary reason for the reduction in provision for credit losses in 2018. Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses increased by $2.0 million, or 12.5%, to $17.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $15.6 million in the prior year, and represented 4.7% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased 52,731 contracts representing $902.4 million in receivables compared to 52,643 contracts representing $859.1 million in receivables in the prior year. Occupancy expenses increased by $445,000 or 6.2%, to $7.6 million compared to $7.2 million in the previous year and represented 2.1% of total operating expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $58,000 or 6.2%, to $992,000 compared to $934,000 in the previous year and represented 0.3% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 20.5%. This includes $2.1 million of income tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Excluding the impact of the tax benefit, the effective tax rate for 2018 would have been 31.8%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 88.3%. This includes $15.1 million of income tax expense related to the effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 41.1%. Comparison of Operating Results for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the year ended December 31, 2016 Revenues . During the year ended December 31, 2017, our revenues were $434.4 million, an increase of $12.1 million, or 2.9%, from the prior year revenues of $422.3 million. The primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $15.2 million, or 3.7%, to $424.2 million from $409.0 million in the prior year. The primary reason for the increase in interest income is the increase in finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries, which increased from $2,307.9 million at December 31, 2016 to $2,333.5 million at December 31, 2017. Other income decreased by $3.1 million, or 23.2%, to $10.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from $13.3 million during the prior year. The decrease in other income resulted from a decrease of $2.8 million in revenues associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers, a decrease of $245,000 in payments from third-party providers of convenience fees paid by our customers for web based and other electronic payments and a decrease of $203,000 in recoveries on previously charged off receivables. Expenses . Our operating expenses consist largely of provision for credit losses, interest expense, employee costs and general and administrative expenses. Provision for credit losses and interest expense are significantly affected by the volume of automobile contracts we purchased during the trailing 12-month period and by the outstanding balance of finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries. Employee costs and general and administrative expenses are incurred as applications and automobile contracts are received, processed and serviced. Factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and changes in the unemployment level. Employee costs include base salaries, commissions and bonuses paid to employees, and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding stock options, and are one of our most significant operating expenses. These costs (other than those relating to stock options) generally fluctuate with the level of applications and automobile contracts processed and serviced. Other operating expenses consist largely of facilities expenses, telephone and other communication services, credit services, computer services, marketing and advertising expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Total operating expenses were $402.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $372.6 million for the prior year, an increase of $29.7 million, or 8.0%. The increase is primarily due to the increase in interest expense, provision for credit losses and servicing costs. Employee costs increased by $7.4 million or 11.3%, to $73.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 18.1% of total operating expenses, from $65.5 million for the prior year, or 17.6% of total operating expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we added Servicing staff to accommodate the increase in the number of accounts in our managed portfolio. The table below summarizes our employees by category as well as contract purchases and units in our managed portfolio as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2017 and 2016: General and administrative expenses include costs associated with purchasing and servicing our portfolio of finance receivables, including expenses for facilities, credit services, and telecommunications. General and administrative expenses were $26.6 million, an increase of $1.8 million, or 7.0%, compared to the previous year and represented 6.6% of total operating expenses. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $12.4 million to $92.3 million, or 15.5%, compared to $79.9 million in the previous year. Interest on securitization trust debt increased by $13.9 million, or 20.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The average balance of securitization trust debt increased 4.7% to $2,172.1 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $2,075.1 million at December 31, 2016. In addition, the blended interest rates on our term securitizations have generally increased since June 2014. As a result, the cost of securitization debt during the year ended December 31, 2017 was 3.8%, compared to 3.3% in the prior year period. For any particular quarterly securitization transaction, the blended cost of funds is ultimately the result of many factors including the market interest rates for benchmark swaps of various maturities against which our bonds are priced and the margin over those benchmarks that investors are willing accept, which in turn, is influenced by investor demand for our bonds at the time of the securitization. These and other factors have resulted in a general trend toward higher securitization trust debt interest costs since June 2014, although that trend has reversed somewhat since July 2016. The blended interest rates of our recent securitizations are summarized in the table below: The annualized average rate on our securitization trust debt was 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.3% in the prior year. The annualized average rate is influenced by the manner in which the underlying securitization trust bonds are repaid. The rate tends to increase over time on any particular securitization since the structures of our securitization trusts generally provide for sequential repayment of the shorter term, lower interest rate bonds before the longer term, higher interest rate bonds. Interest expense on our subordinated debt decreased by $20,000, or 1.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The reduction was the result of a decrease in the average interest rate on our subordinated renewable notes to 8.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 8.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was mostly offset by an increase in the average balance of the notes from $15.1 million in the prior year to $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense on residual interest financing was $846,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016. This debt was repaid in full in November 2016. Interest expense on warehouse lines of credit decreased by $636,000, or 7.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year. The decrease is due primarily to lower utilization of our warehouse lines in 2017 compared to 2016. The following table presents the components of interest income and interest expense and a net interest yield analysis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: Provision for credit losses was $186.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $8.2 million, or 4.6% compared to the prior year and represented 46.4% of total operating expenses. The provision for credit losses maintains the allowance for finance credit losses at levels that we feel are adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated. Our approach for establishing the allowance requires greater amounts of provision for credit losses early in the terms of our finance receivables, and also takes into account the performance of the receivables. Consequently, the increase in provision expense is the result of the larger portfolio owned by our consolidated subsidiaries compared to the prior year and an adverse trend in the performance of our receivables. Marketing expenses consist primarily of commission-based compensation paid to our employee marketing representatives. Our marketing representatives earn a salary plus commissions based on volume of contract purchases and sales of ancillary products and services that we offer our dealers, such as training programs, internet lead sales, and direct mail products. Marketing expenses decreased by $2.2 million, or 12.4%, to $15.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.8 million in the prior year, and represented 3.9% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 52,643 contracts representing $859.1 million in receivables compared to 66,527 contracts representing $1,088.8 million in receivables in the prior year. Occupancy expenses increased by $2.0 million or 38.1%, to $7.2 million compared to $5.2 million in the previous year and represented 1.8% of total operating expenses. The increase in occupancy expense is a result of leases for additional office space in Irvine, California and Las Vegas, Nevada. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $157,000 or 20.2%, to $934,000 compared to $777,000 in the previous year and represented 0.1% of total operating expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million, representing an effective income tax rate of 88.3%. This includes $15.1 million of income tax expense related to the effects of the Tax Act, which are required to be recorded in the period of enactment. Excluding the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 would have been 41.1%. In 2016, we recorded $20.4 million of income tax expense, representing a 41.0% effective income tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity Our business requires substantial cash to support our acquisitions of automobile contracts and other operating activities. Our primary sources of cash have been cash flow from operating activities, including proceeds from term securitization transactions and other sales of automobile contracts, amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities, servicing fees on portfolios of automobile contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties, customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables, fees for origination of automobile contracts, and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of automobile contracts in which we have retained a residual ownership interest and the related spread accounts. Our primary uses of cash have been the acquisitions of automobile contracts, repayment of securitization trust debt, repayment of amounts borrowed under warehouse credit facilities, operating expenses such as employee, interest, occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses, the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions, and income taxes. There can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet our cash demands. The sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools (which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related spread accounts), the rate of expansion or contraction in our managed portfolio, and the terms upon which we are able to purchase, sell, and borrow against automobile contracts. Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $216.2 million, $215.6 million and $196.3 million, respectively. Net cash from operating activities is generally provided by net income from operations adjusted for significant non-cash items such as our provision for credit losses and accretion of deferred acquisition fees. Net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $242.2 million, $210.6 million and $437.8 million, respectively. Cash provided by investing activities primarily results from principal payments and other proceeds received on finance receivables held for investment. Cash used in investing activities generally relates to acquisitions of finance receivables. Acquisitions of finance receivables held for investment were $914.9 million (includes acquisition fees paid), $859.1 million and $1,088.8 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 was $31.4 million and $242.8 million, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $7.0 million. Cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the repayment or issuance of debt, and in particular, securitization trust debt and portfolio acquisition financing. We issued $855.8 million in new securitization trust debt in 2018 compared to $852.6 million in 2017 and $1,197.5 million in 2016. Repayments of securitization debt were $876.1 million, $851.2 million and $834.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We purchase automobile contracts from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount, adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price. Those automobile contracts generate cash flow, however, over a period of years. As a result, we have been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase automobile contracts and on access to the asset-backed securitization market for long-term financing of our portfolio of automobile contracts. In addition, from time to time, we have relied on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance our continuing operations, as well as to fund the portion of automobile contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent financing in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. Of those, the factor most subject to our control is the rate at which we acquire automobile contracts. We are and may in the future be limited in our ability to purchase automobile contracts due to limits on our capital. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash of $12.8 million. We had an aggregate of $161.9 million available under our three $100 million warehouse credit facilities (subject to available eligible collateral and our own capital). During 2018 we completed four securitizations aggregating $883.5 million of receivables, and we intend to continue completing securitizations regularly during 2019, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Our plans to manage our liquidity include maintaining our rate of automobile contract purchases at a level that matches our available capital, and, as appropriate, minimizing our operating costs. If we are unable to complete such securitizations, we may be unable to increase our rate of automobile contract purchases, in which case our interest income and other portfolio related income could decrease. Our liquidity will also be affected by releases of cash from the trusts established with our securitizations. While the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions, our securitization agreements generally provide that we will receive excess cash flows, if any, only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and the delinquency, defaults or net losses related to the automobile contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels. In the event delinquencies, defaults or net losses on the automobile contracts exceed such levels, the terms of the securitization: (i) may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool; or (ii) in certain circumstances, may permit the transfer of servicing on some or all of the automobile contracts to another servicer. There can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash. We currently have and will continue to have a substantial amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $2,256.9 million of debt outstanding. Such debt consisted primarily of $2,063.6 million of securitization trust debt, $136.8 million of warehouse lines of credit, $39.1 million of residual interest financing debt and $17.3 million in subordinated renewable notes. We are also currently offering the subordinated renewable notes to the public on a continuous basis, and such notes have maturities that range from three months to 10 years. Although we believe we are able to service and repay our debt, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so. If our plans for future operations do not generate sufficient cash flows and earnings, our ability to make required payments on our debt would be impaired. Failure to pay our indebtedness when due could have a material adverse effect and may require us to issue additional debt or equity securities. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands): We anticipate repaying debt due in 2019 with a combination of cash flows from operations and the potential issuance of new debt. Warehouse Credit Facilities The terms on which credit has been available to us for purchase of automobile contracts have varied in recent years, as shown in the following summary of our warehouse credit facilities: Facility Established in May 2012. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 87.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In September 2018, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to September 2020 and to include an amortization period through September 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was $99.9 million outstanding under this facility. Facility Established in April 2015. On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In April 2017, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to April 2019 followed by an amortization period through April 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was $38.2 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023. Facility Established in November 2015. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables, or up to 80.0% for certain other receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 6.75% per annum, with a minimum rate of 7.75% per annum. In November 2017, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to November 2019 followed by an amortization period through November 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was no amount outstanding under this facility. Capital Resources Securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables, and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced. Although the securitization trust debt also has alternative final maturity dates, those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated, and at no time in our history have any of our sponsored asset-backed securities reached those alternative final maturities. The acquisition of automobile contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions, and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization, if any, when those transactions take place, results in a continuing need for capital. The amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of our automobile contract purchases, the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations, and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to us or capture cash from collections on securitized automobile contracts. We plan to adjust our levels of automobile contract purchases and the related capital requirements to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts. Capitalization Over the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 we have managed our capitalization by issuing and refinancing debt as summarized in the following table: Residual Interest Financing. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. As of December 31, 2018, $40.0 million of residual interest financing debt remains outstanding. This amount does not exclude $894,000 in unamortized debt issuance costs. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Securitization Trust Debt. Since 2011, we treated all 30 of our securitizations of automobile contracts as secured financings for financial accounting purposes, and the asset-backed securities issued in such securitizations remain on our consolidated balance sheet as securitization trust debt. We had $2,063.6 million of securitization trust debt outstanding at December 31, 2018. Subordinated Renewable Notes Debt. In June 2005, we began issuing registered subordinated renewable notes in an ongoing offering to the public. Upon maturity, the notes are automatically renewed for the same term as the maturing notes, unless we repay the notes or the investor notifies us within 15 days after the maturity date of his note that he wants it repaid. Renewed notes bear interest at the rate we are offering at that time to other investors with similar note maturities. Based on the terms of the individual notes, interest payments may be required monthly, quarterly, annually or upon maturity. At December 31, 2018 there were $17.3 million of such notes outstanding. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth, capitalization, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such covenants. Forward-looking Statements This report on Form 10-K includes certain "" forward-looking statements "". Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "" anticipates, "" "" expects, "" "" plans, "" "" estimates, "" or words of like meaning. As to the specifically identified forward-looking statements, factors that could affect charge-offs and recovery rates include changes in the general economic climate, which could affect the willingness or ability of obligors to pay pursuant to the terms of contracts, changes in laws respecting consumer finance, which could affect our ability to enforce rights under contracts, and changes in the market for used vehicles, which could affect the levels of recoveries upon sale of repossessed vehicles. Factors that could affect our revenues in the current year include the levels of cash releases from existing pools of contracts, which would affect our ability to purchase contracts, the terms on which we are able to finance such purchases, the willingness of dealers to sell contracts to us on the terms that it offers, and the terms on which we are able to complete term securitizations once contracts are acquired. Factors that could affect our expenses in the current year include competitive conditions in the market for qualified personnel, investor demand for asset-backed securities and interest rates (which affect the rates that we pay on asset-backed securities issued in our securitizations). The statements concerning structuring securitization transactions as secured financings and the effects of such structures on financial items and on future profitability also are forward-looking statements. Any change to the structure of our securitization transaction could cause such forward-looking statements to be inaccurate. Both the amount of the effect of the change in structure on our profitability and the duration of the period in which our profitability would be affected by the change in securitization structure are estimates. The accuracy of such estimates will be affected by the rate at which we purchase and sell contracts, any changes in that rate, the credit performance of such contracts, the financial terms of future securitizations, any changes in such terms over time, and other factors that generally affect our profitability. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization. Specifically, the interest rate due on our warehouse credit facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed. Therefore, if interest rates increase, the interest we must pay to our lenders under warehouse credit facilities is likely to increase while the interest we receive from warehoused automobile contracts remains the same. As a result, excess spread cash flow would likely decrease during the warehousing period. Additionally, automobile contracts warehoused and then securitized during a rising interest rate environment may result in less excess spread cash flow to us. Historically, our securitization facilities have paid fixed rate interest to security holders set at prevailing interest rates at the time of the closing of the securitization, which may not take place until several months after we purchased those contracts. Our customers, on the other hand, pay fixed rates of interest on the automobile contracts, set at the time they purchase the underlying vehicles. A decrease in excess spread cash flow could adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the short-term risk relating to interest rates payable under the warehouse facilities, we have historically held automobile contracts in the warehouse credit facilities for less than four months. To mitigate, but not eliminate, the long-term risk relating to interest rates payable by us in securitizations, we have structured our term securitization transactions to include pre-funding structures, whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts. We expect to continue to use pre-funding structures in our securitizations. In pre-funding, the proceeds from the pre-funded portion are held in an escrow account until we sell the additional contracts to the trust. In pre-funded securitizations, we lock in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts we subsequently deliver to the securitization trust. However, we incur an expense in pre-funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding. The amount of such expense may vary. Despite these mitigation strategies, an increase in prevailing interest rates would cause us to receive less excess spread cash flows on automobile contracts, and thus could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "" Exchange Act "" ) as of December 31, 2018 (the "" Evaluation Date "" ). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective (i) to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer required under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have been filed as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this report. Internal Control. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting is included in this Annual Report, immediately below. During the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers, believes that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria. Our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been audited by Crowe LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Fritz, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting Officer) INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries Las Vegas, Nevada Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ CROWE LLP Costa Mesa, California March 13, 2019 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2008.

AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. ( "" CPS "" ) was incorporated in California on March 8, 1991. CPS and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "" Company "" ) specialize in purchasing and servicing retail automobile installment sale contracts ( "" Contracts "" ) originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers ( "" Dealers "" ) located throughout the United States. Dealers located in Ohio, California, North Carolina, Florida and Indiana represented 8.8%, 8.7%, 6.2%, 6.0% and 5.2%, respectively, of contracts purchased during 2018 compared with 7.4%, 7.1%, 5.8%, 5.9% and 3.8% respectively in 2017. No other state had a concentration in excess of 5.2% in 2018. We specialize in contracts with vehicle purchasers who generally would not be expected to qualify for traditional financing provided by commercial banks or automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. We are subject to various regulations and laws as they relate to the extension of credit in consumer credit transactions. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain of which are special purpose subsidiaries ( "" SPS "" ), formed to accommodate the structures under which we purchase and securitize our contracts. The Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of CPS Leasing, Inc., an 80% owned subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Cash and Cash Equivalents For purposes of the statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and due from banks and money market accounts. Substantially all of our cash is deposited at three financial institutions. We maintain cash due from banks in excess of the banks' insured deposit limits. We do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these deposits. As part of certain financial covenants related to debt facilities, we are required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance. As of December 31, 2018, our unrestricted cash balance was $12.8 million, which exceeded the minimum amounts required by our financial covenants. Finance Receivables Finance receivables, which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are presented at cost. All finance receivable contracts are held for investment. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. Generally, payments received on finance receivables are restricted to certain securitized pools, and the related contracts cannot be resold. Finance receivables are charged off pursuant to the controlling documents of certain securitized pools, generally as described below under Charge Off Policy. Management may authorize an extension of payment terms if collection appears likely during the next calendar month. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts that are collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a Contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the Contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a Contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. Finance Receivables Measured at Fair Value Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired on or after that date. For each finance receivable acquired after 2017, we consider the price paid on the purchase date as the fair value for such receivable. We estimate the cash to be received in the future with respect to such receivables, based on our experience with similar receivables acquired in the past. We then compute the internal rate of return that results in the present value of those estimated cash receipts being equal to the purchase date fair value. Thereafter, we recognize interest income on such receivables on a level yield basis using that internal rate of return as the applicable interest rate. Cash received with respect to such receivables is applied first against such interest income, and then to reduce the carrying value of the receivables. We re-evaluate the fair value of such receivables at the close of each measurement period. If the reevaluation were to yield a value materially different from the carrying value, an adjustment would be required. Anticipated credit losses are included in our estimation of cash to be received with respect to receivables. Because such credit losses are included in our computation of the appropriate level yield, we do not thereafter make periodic provision for credit losses, as our best estimate of the lifetime aggregate of credit losses is included in that initial computation. Also because we include anticipated credit losses in our computation of the level yield, the computed level yield is materially lower than the average contractual rate applicable to the receivables. Because our initial carrying value is fixed as the price we pay for the receivable, rather than as the contractual principal balance, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Allowance for Finance Credit Losses In order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses likely incurred on finance receivables, we use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as "" static pooling, "" which stratifies the finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on their period of origination, then uses historical performance of seasoned pools to estimate future losses on current pools. Historical loss experience is adjusted as necessary for current economic conditions. We consider our portfolio of finance receivables to be relatively homogenous and consequently we analyze credit performance primarily in the aggregate rather than stratification by any particular credit quality indicator. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of finance receivable contracts. For each monthly pool of contracts that we purchase, we begin establishing the allowance in the month of acquisition and increase it over the subsequent 11 months, through a provision for credit losses charged to our Consolidated Statement of Income. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies, the characteristics of the portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral and historical loss trends. As conditions change, our level of provisioning and/or allowance may change. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Charge Off Policy Delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has been repossessed are generally charged off at the earliest of (1) the month in which the proceeds from the sale of the financed vehicle are received, (2) the month in which 90 days have passed from the date of repossession or (3) the month in which the Contract becomes seven scheduled payments past due (see Repossessed and Other Assets below). The amount charged off is the remaining principal balance of the Contract, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle. With respect to delinquent contracts for which the related financed vehicle has not been repossessed, the remaining principal balance is generally charged off no later than the end of the month that the Contract becomes five scheduled payments past due. Contract Acquisition Fees and Origination Costs Upon purchase of a Contract from a Dealer, we generally either charge or advance the Dealer an acquisition fee. Dealer acquisition fees and deferred origination costs are applied to the carrying value of finance receivables and are accreted into earnings as an adjustment to the yield over the estimated life of the Contract using the interest method. However, for receivables measured at fair value, we do not record acquisition fees as an amortizing asset related to the receivables, nor do we capitalize costs of acquiring the receivables. Rather we recognize the costs of acquisition as expenses in the period incurred. Repossessed and Other Assets If a Contract obligor fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the obligor is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision is made between the 60th and 90th day past the obligor’s payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we stop accruing interest on the Contract, and reclassify the remaining Contract balance to the line item ""Other Assets"" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets are repossessed vehicles pending sale of $8.9 million and $9.7 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Treatment of Securitizations Our term securitization structure has generally been as follows: We sell contracts we acquire to a wholly-owned SPS, which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling our contracts. The SPS then transfers the same contracts to another entity, typically a statutory trust ( "" Trust "" ). The Trust issues interest-bearing asset-backed securities ( "" Notes "" ), in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts. We typically sell these contracts to the Trust at face value and without recourse, except representations and warranties that we make to the Trust that are similar to those provided to us by the Dealer. One or more investors (the "" Noteholders "" ) purchase the Notes issued by the Trust; the proceeds from the sale of the Notes are then used to purchase the contracts from us. We may retain or sell subordinated Notes issued by the Trust. In addition, we have provided "" Credit Enhancement "" for the benefit of the Noteholders in three forms: (1) an initial cash deposit to a bank account (a "" Spread Account "" ) held by the Trust, (2) overcollateralization of the Notes, where the principal balance of the Notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts, and (3) in the form of subordinated Notes. The agreements governing the securitization transactions (collectively referred to as the "" Securitization Agreements "" ) require that the initial level of Credit Enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of Credit Enhancement reaches specified levels, which are then maintained. The specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts. The specified levels at which the Credit Enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the Trusts and on other conditions. Such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios, and have also varied from one Trust to another. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our warehouse securitization structures are similar to the above, except that (i) the SPS that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes or loans that it issues, and (ii) no increase in the required amount of Credit Enhancement is contemplated. Upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing, we retain as assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet the securitized contracts and record as indebtedness the Notes issued in the transaction. We have the power to direct the most significant activities of the SPS. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the rights to receive benefits from the SPS, both of which could be potentially significant to the SPS. These types of securitization structures are treated as secured financings, in which the receivables remain on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the debt issued by the SPS is shown as a securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We receive periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts. In addition, we are entitled to the cash flows from the Trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the Notes, the base servicing fees, and certain other fees (such as trustee and custodial fees). Required principal payments on the Notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the Notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts (excluding those contracts that have been charged off), or a pre-determined percentage of such balance. Where that percentage is less than 100%, the related Securitization Agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the Notes is reduced to the specified percentage. Such accelerated principal payment is said to create "" overcollateralization "" of the Notes. If the amount of cash required for payment of fees, interest and principal on the senior Notes exceeds the amount collected during the collection period, the shortfall is generally withdrawn from the Spread Account, if any. If the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations plus required principal payments on the subordinated Notes, if any, and there is no shortfall in the related Spread Account or other form of Credit Enhancement, the excess is released to us. If the total Credit Enhancement amount is not at the required level, then the excess cash collected is retained in the Trust until the specified level is achieved. Cash in the Spread Accounts is restricted from our use. Cash held in the various Spread Accounts is invested in high quality, liquid investment securities, as specified in the Securitization Agreements. In all of our term securitizations we have transferred the receivables (through a subsidiary) to the securitization Trust. We report the assets and liabilities of the securitization Trust on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Noteholders’ and the related securitization Trusts’ recourse against us for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited, in general, to our Finance Receivables, and Spread Accounts. Servicing We consider the contractual servicing fee received on our managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries to be equal to adequate compensation. Additionally, we consider that these fees would fairly compensate a substitute servicer, should one be required. As a result, no servicing asset or liability has been recognized. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by non-consolidated subsidiaries are reported as income when earned. Servicing fees received on the managed portfolio held by consolidated subsidiaries are included in interest income when earned. Servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. Servicing fees receivable, which are included in Other Assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent fees earned but not yet remitted to us by the trustee. Furniture and Equipment Furniture and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. We calculate depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to five years. Assets held under capital leases and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the related lease terms. Amortization expense on assets acquired under capital lease is included with depreciation expense on owned assets. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Other Income The following table presents the primary components of Other Income: Earnings Per Share The following table illustrates the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Incremental shares of 10.3 million, 7.5 million and 7.9 million related to stock options and warrants have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, because the effect is anti-dilutive. Deferral and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs Costs related to the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized using the interest method over the contractual or expected term of the related debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the related debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand-alone state franchise tax returns for certain states. We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We estimate a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely. Purchases of Company Stock We record purchases of our own common stock at cost and treat the shares as retired. Stock Option Plan We recognize compensation costs in the financial statements based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718 “Stock Compensation”. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported periods. These material estimates that could be susceptible to changes in the near term and, accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification Certain amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation with no effect on previously reported earnings or shareholders’ equity. Financial Covenants Certain of our securitization transactions, our residual interest financing and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2018 we were in compliance with all such financial covenants. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Provision for Contingent Liabilities We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Our legal counsel has advised us on such matters where, based on information available at the time of this report, there is an indication that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably determined. We have recorded a liability as of December 31, 2018, which represents our best estimate of the immaterial aggregate probable incurred losses for legal contingencies. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred, over and above such losses as are probable, cannot be estimated with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. The majority of the Company’s revenues come from interest income which is outside the scope of ASC 606. The Company’s services that fall within the scope of ASC 606 are presented within Other Income and are recognized as revenue as the Company satisfies its obligation to the customer. Services within the scope of ASC 606 include revenue associated with direct mail and other related products and services that we offer to our dealers. In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The revised accounting guidance changes the criteria under which credit losses are measured. The amendment introduces a new credit reserving model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model, which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current U.S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to establish credit loss estimates. This new accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13, however, it is expected that the new CECL model will alter the assumptions used in calculating the Company's credit losses, given the change to estimated losses for the estimated life of the financial asset, and will likely result in a material effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. We will adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective transition method. The Company anticipates recording lease assets and liabilities of approximately $24.2 million on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations. (2) Restricted Cash Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalent accounts relating to our outstanding securitization trusts and credit facilities. The amount of restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheets was $117.3 million and $112.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our securitization transactions and one of our warehouse credit facilities require that we establish cash reserves, or spread accounts, as additional credit enhancement. These cash reserves, which are included in restricted cash, were $48.5 million and $45.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (3) Finance Receivables Our portfolio of finance receivables consists of small-balance homogeneous contracts comprising a single segment and class that is collectively evaluated for impairment on a portfolio basis according to delinquency status. Our contract purchase guidelines are designed to produce a homogenous portfolio. We report delinquency on a contractual basis. Once a contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the obligor under the contract makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received on a contract that is greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction. In January 2018 the Company adopted the fair value method of accounting for finance receivables acquired after 2017. Finance receivables measured at fair value are recorded separately on the Company’s Balance Sheet and are excluded from all tables in this footnote. The following table presents the components of finance receivables, net of unearned interest: We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due, as extended where applicable. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not reported as delinquent. In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor’s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In certain limited cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions, such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings. The following table summarizes the delinquency status of finance receivables as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: Finance receivables totaling $31.8 million and $27.5 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, have been placed on non-accrual status as a result of their delinquency status. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We use a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as ""static pooling,"" which stratifies our finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools based on the period of origination. Using analytical and formula driven techniques, we estimate an allowance for finance credit losses, which we believe is adequate for probable incurred credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in our portfolio of automobile contracts. The estimate for probable incurred credit losses is reduced by our estimate for future recoveries on previously incurred losses. Provision for credit losses is charged to our consolidated statement of income. Net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance. We establish the allowance for new receivables over the 12-month period following their acquisition. The following table presents a summary of the activity for the allowance for finance credit losses, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: Excluded from finance receivables are contracts that were previously classified as finance receivables but were reclassified as other assets because we have repossessed the vehicle securing the Contract. The following table presents a summary of such repossessed inventory together with the allowance for losses on repossessed inventory: (4) Furniture and Equipment The following table presents the components of furniture and equipment: Depreciation expense totaled $992,000, $934,000 and $777,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (5) Securitization Trust Debt We have completed numerous term securitization transactions that are structured as secured borrowings for financial accounting purposes. The debt issued in these transactions is shown on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as “Securitization trust debt,” and the components of such debt are summarized in the following table: Final Scheduled Payment Date (1) Receivables Pledged at December 31, 2018 (2) Initial Principal Outstanding Principal at December 31, 2018 Outstanding Principal at December 31, 2017 Weighted Average Contractual Interest Rate at December 31, 2018 _________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt issuance costs of $11.8 million and $12.5 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Securitization trust debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the securitization trust debt was issued in private placement transactions to qualified institutional investors. The debt was issued by our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries and is secured by the assets of such subsidiaries, but not by any of our other assets. The terms of the various securitization agreements related to the issuance of the securitization trust debt require that certain delinquency and credit loss criteria be met with respect to the collateral pool, and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceed maximum leverage levels. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of December 31, 2018. We are responsible for the administration and collection of the contracts. The securitization agreements also require certain funds be held in restricted cash accounts to provide additional credit enhancement for the Notes or to be applied to make payments on the securitization trust debt. As of December 31, 2018, restricted cash under the various agreements totaled approximately $117.3 million. Interest expense on the securitization trust debt is composed of the stated rate of interest plus amortization of additional costs of borrowing. Additional costs of borrowing include facility fees, insurance premiums, amortization of deferred financing costs, and amortization of discounts required on the notes at the time of issuance. Deferred financing costs related to the securitization trust debt are amortized using the interest method. Accordingly, the effective cost of borrowing of the securitization trust debt is greater than the stated rate of interest. Our wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote subsidiaries were formed to facilitate the above asset-backed financing transactions. Similar bankruptcy remote subsidiaries issue the debt outstanding under our warehouse line of credit. Bankruptcy remote refers to a legal structure in which it is expected that the applicable entity would not be included in any bankruptcy filing by its parent or affiliates. All of the assets of these subsidiaries have been pledged as collateral for the related debt. All such transactions, treated as secured financings for accounting and tax purposes, are treated as sales for all other purposes, including legal and bankruptcy purposes. None of the assets of these subsidiaries are available to pay any of our other creditors. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (6) Debt The terms of our debt outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized below: Debt issuance costs of $1.2 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, have been excluded from the table above. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the Warehouse lines of credit and residual interest financing on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. On May 11, 2012, we entered into a $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Citibank, N.A. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Eight Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 87.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 3.00% per annum, with a minimum rate of 3.75% per annum. In September 2018, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to September 2020 and to include an amortization period through September 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was $99.9 million outstanding under this facility. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On April 17, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Six Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at one-month LIBOR plus 5.50% per annum, with a minimum rate of 6.50% per annum. In April 2017, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to April 2019 followed by an amortization period through April 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was $38.2 million outstanding under this facility. In February 2019, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023. On November 24, 2015, we entered into an additional $100 million one-year warehouse credit line with affiliates of Credit Suisse Group and Ares Management LP. The facility is structured to allow us to fund a portion of the purchase price of automobile contracts by borrowing from a credit facility to our consolidated subsidiary Page Nine Funding, LLC. The facility provides for effective advances up to 88.0% of eligible finance receivables, or up to 80.0% for certain other receivables. The loans under the facility accrue interest at a commercial paper rate plus 6.75% per annum, with a minimum rate of 7.75% per annum. In November 2017, this facility was amended to extend the revolving period to November 2019 followed by an amortization period through November 2021 for any receivables pledged to the facility at the end of the revolving period. At December 31, 2018 there was no amount outstanding under this facility. The total outstanding debt on our three warehouse lines of credit was $138.1 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $114.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2017. The costs incurred in conjunction with the above debt are recorded as deferred financing costs on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are more fully described in Note 1. On May 16, 2018, we completed a $40.0 million securitization of residual interests from previously issued securitizations. In this residual interest financing transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $40.0 million of asset-backed notes secured by residual interests in thirteen CPS securitizations consecutively conducted from September 2013 through December 2016, and an 80% interest in a CPS affiliate that owns the residual interests in the four CPS securitizations conducted in 2017. The sold notes (“2018-1 Notes”), issued by CPS Auto Securitization Trust 2018-1, consist of a single class with a coupon of 8.595%. The agreed valuation of the collateral for the 2018-1 Notes is the sum of the amounts on deposit in the underlying spread accounts for each related securitization and the over-collateralization of each related securitization, which is the difference between the outstanding principal balances of the related receivables less the principal balance of the outstanding notes issued in the related securitization. With respect to the securitizations conducted by CPS in 2017, only 80% of such amounts are included in the collateral. On each monthly payment date, the 2018-1 Notes are entitled to interest at the coupon rate and, if necessary, a principal payment necessary to maintain a specified minimum collateral ratio. Unamortized debt issuance costs of $894,000 have been excluded from the amount reported above for residual interest financing. These debt issuance costs are presented as a direct deduction to the carrying amount of the debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We must comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants related to debt facilities, which require, among other things, that we maintain certain financial ratios related to liquidity, net worth and capitalization. Further covenants include matters relating to investments, acquisitions, restricted payments and certain dividend restrictions. See the discussion of financial covenants in Note 1. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table summarizes the contractual and expected maturity amounts of long term debt as of December 31, 2018: (7) Shareholders’ Equity Common Stock Holders of common stock are entitled to such dividends as our board of directors, in its discretion, may declare out of funds available, subject to the terms of any outstanding shares of preferred stock and other restrictions. In the event of liquidation of the Company, holders of common stock are entitled to receive, pro rata , all of the assets of the Company available for distribution, after payment of any liquidation preference to the holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of the shares of common stock have no conversion or preemptive or other subscription rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. Stock Purchases For the year ending December 31, 2018, we purchased 1,382,401 shares of our common stock at an average price of $3.81. In October 2017 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of our common stock. There is approximately $7.5 million of board authorization remaining under such plans, which have no expiration date. The table below describes the purchase of our common stock for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: Options and Warrants In 2006, the Company adopted and its shareholders approved the CPS 2006 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) pursuant to which our Board of Directors, or a duly-authorized committee thereof, may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights to our employees or employees of our subsidiaries, to directors of the Company, and to individuals acting as consultants to the Company or its subsidiaries. In June 2008, May 2012, April 2013, May 2015 and again in July 2018, the shareholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2006 Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be subject to awards under the 2006 Plan to 5,000,000, 7,200,000, 12,200,000, 17,200,000 and 19,200,000, respectively, in each case plus shares authorized under prior plans and not issued. Options that have been granted under the 2006 Plan and a previous plan approved in 1997 have been granted at an exercise price equal to (or greater than) the stock’s fair value at the date of the grant, with terms generally of 7-10 years and vesting generally over 4-5 years. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The per share weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $1.06, $1.32 and $1.38, respectively. That fair value was estimated using a binomial option pricing model using the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table. We use historical data to estimate the expected term of each option. The volatility estimate is based on the historical and implied volatility of our stock over the period that equals the expected life of the option. Volatility assumptions ranged from 31% to 34% for 2018, 35% to 37% for 2017, and 44% to 51% for 2016. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield on a U.S. Treasury bond with a maturity comparable to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is estimated to be zero based on our intention not to issue dividends for the foreseeable future. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation costs in the amount of $3.5 million, $5.7 million and $5.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods was equal to $3.6 million. This amount will be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, options outstanding had intrinsic values of $4.9 million and $10.4 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, options exercisable had intrinsic values of $4.9 million and $9.5 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $869,000 and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. New shares were issued for all options exercised during the year ended December 2018 and cash of $483,000 million was received. At December 31, 2018, there were a total of 2,873,000 additional shares available for grant under the 2006 Plan. Stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2018 for stock options under the 2006 and 1997 plans is as follows: We did not issue any stock options with an exercise price above or below the market price of the stock on the grant date for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In connection with the amendment to and partial repayment of our residual interest financing in July 2008, we issued warrants exercisable for 2,500,000 common shares, and allocated $4,071,429 of the aggregate consideration received in that transaction to the issuance of the warrants. The warrants represented the right to purchase CPS common shares at a nominal exercise price. In March 2010 we repurchased the warrants for 500,000 of these shares for $1.0 million. Warrants to purchase 2,000,000 shares were exercised on July 10, 2018 and 1,999,995 net shares were issued to the holder, following surrender of five shares in payment of the exercise price. (8) Interest Income and Interest Expense The following table presents the components of interest income: The following table presents the components of interest expense: (9) Income Taxes Income taxes consist of the following: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 differs from the amount determined by applying the statutory federal rate to income before income taxes as follows: For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $3.8 million which include a $2.1 million net tax benefit related to certain tax planning strategies and other adjustments. Without the benefit, income tax expense for 2018 would have been $5.9 million. The tax effected cumulative temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS We acquired certain net operating losses and built-in loss assets as part of our acquisitions of MFN Financial Corp. (“MFN”) in 2002 and TFC Enterprises, Inc. (“TFC”) in 2003. Moreover, both MFN and TFC have undergone an ownership change for purposes of Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382. In general, IRC Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a loss corporation (that is, a corporation with a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, credit carryforward, or certain built-in losses (“BILs”)) to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards or BILs to offset taxable income arising after an ownership change. In determining the possible future realization of deferred tax assets, we have considered future taxable income from the following sources: (a) reversal of taxable temporary differences; and (b) tax planning strategies that, if necessary, would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into years in which net operating losses might otherwise expire. Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making such judgements, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Although realization is not assured, we believe that the realization of the recognized net deferred tax asset of $19.2 million as of December 31, 2018 is more likely than not based on forecasted future net earnings. Our net deferred tax asset of $19.2 million consists of approximately $13.9 million of net U.S. federal deferred tax assets and $5.3 million of net state deferred tax assets. The major components of the deferred tax asset are $12.4 million in net operating loss carryforwards and built in losses and $6.8 million in net deductions which have not yet been taken on a tax return. As of December 31, 2018, we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of $35.7 million. These state net operating losses begin to expire in 2019. We recognize a tax position as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At December 31, 2018, we had no unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. We are subject to taxation in the US and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014. (10) Related Party Transactions In December 2007, one of our directors purchased a $4.0 million subordinated renewable note pursuant to our ongoing program of issuing such notes to the public. The note was purchased through the registered agent and under the same terms and conditions, including the interest rate, that were offered to other purchasers at the time the note was issued. As of December 31, 2018, $4.0 million was outstanding on this note. The note was redeemed at par plus accrued interest in February 2019. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (11) Commitments and Contingencies Leases The Company leases its facilities and certain computer equipment under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire through 2025. Future minimum lease payments at December 31, 2018, under these leases are due during the years ended December 31 as follows: Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, was $7.2 million, $6.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively. Our facility leases contain certain rental concessions and escalating rental payments, which are recognized as adjustments to rental expense and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. Legal Proceedings Consumer Litigation. We are routinely involved in various legal proceedings resulting from our consumer finance activities and practices, both continuing and discontinued. Consumers can and do initiate lawsuits against us alleging violations of law applicable to collection of receivables, and such lawsuits sometimes allege that resolution as a class action is appropriate. For the most part, we have legal and factual defenses to consumer claims, which we routinely contest or settle (for immaterial amounts) depending on the particular circumstances of each case. Department of Justice Industry Inquiry. In January 2015, we were served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) directing us to produce certain documents relating to our and our subsidiaries’ and affiliates’ origination and securitization of sub-prime automobile contracts since 2005, in connection with an investigation by the DOJ in contemplation of a civil proceeding for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ in its investigation requested information relating, among other matters, to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile contracts and to the representations and warranties relating to those underwriting criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile contracts. We are among several other securitizers of sub-prime automobile receivables who received such subpoenas in 2014, 2015 and 2016. We have provided the required information, and we were advised by the DOJ in February 2018 that no further information is required of us and that no enforcement action is recommended. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Although the inquiry commenced January 2015 is thus completed as to us, no assurance can be given as to whether some other government agency may commence inquiries into or actions against us, nor as to whether the DOJ may recommence its investigation, any of which hypothetical proceedings might materially and adversely affect us. Wage and Hour Claim. On September 24, 2018, a former employee filed a lawsuit against us in the Superior Court of Orange County, California, alleging that we incorrectly classified our sales and marketing representatives as outside salespersons exempt from overtime wages, mandatory break periods and certain other employee protective provisions of California and federal law. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an award of unpaid wages, liquidated damages, and attorney fees and interest. The plaintiff purports to act on behalf of a class of similarly situated employees and ex-employees. As of the date of this report, no motion for class certification has been filed or granted. We believe that our compensation practices with respect to our marketing representatives are compliant with applicable law. Accordingly, we have defended and intend to continue to defend this lawsuit. We have not recorded a liability with respect to this claim on the accompanying consolidated financial statements . In General . There can be no assurance as to the outcomes of the matters described or referenced above. We record at each measurement date, most recently as of December 31, 2018, our best estimate of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies, including each of the matters described or referenced above. The amount of losses that may ultimately be incurred cannot be estimated with certainty. However, based on such information as is available to us, we believe that the total of probable incurred losses for legal contingencies as of December 31, 2018 is immaterial, and that the range of reasonably possible losses for the legal proceedings and contingencies we face, including those described or referenced above, as of December 31, 2018 does not exceed $3 million. Accordingly, we believe that the ultimate resolution of such legal proceedings and contingencies should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the uncertainties inherent in contested proceedings, the wide discretion vested in the DOJ and other government agencies, and the deference that courts may give to assertions made by government litigants, there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not be material to our operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our income for that period. (12) Employee Benefits We sponsor a pretax savings and profit sharing plan (the “401(k) Plan”) qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible employees are able to contribute up to the maximum allowed under the law. We may, at our discretion, match 100% of employees’ contributions up to $2,000 per employee per calendar year. Our matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $1.5 million, $1.2 million, and $929,000 respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. We also sponsor a defined benefit plan, the MFN Financial Corporation Pension Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan benefits were frozen on June 30, 2001. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following tables represents a reconciliation of the change in the plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2018 and 2017: Additional Information Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and cost at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our overall expected long-term rate of return on assets is 7.25% per annum as of December 31, 2018. The expected long-term rate of return is based on the weighted average of historical returns on individual asset categories, which are described in more detail below. The estimated net loss that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2019 is $376,000. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The weighted average asset allocation of our pension benefits at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: Our investment policies and strategies for the pension benefits plan utilize a target allocation of 75% equity securities and 25% fixed income securities (excluding Company stock). Our investment goals are to maximize returns subject to specific risk management policies. We address risk management and diversification by the use of a professional investment advisor and several sub-advisors which invest in domestic and international equity securities and domestic fixed income securities. Each sub-advisor focuses its investments within a specific sector of the equity or fixed income market. For the sub-advisors focused on the equity markets, the sectors are differentiated by the market capitalization, the relative valuation and the location of the underlying issuer. For the sub-advisors focused on the fixed income markets, the sectors are differentiated by the credit quality and the maturity of the underlying fixed income investment. The investments made by the sub-advisors are readily marketable and can be sold to fund benefit payment obligations as they become payable. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017, by asset category, is as follows: ________________________ CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (13) Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, ""Fair Value Measurements"" clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The three levels are defined as follows: level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; level 2 – inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and level 3 – inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Effective January 2018 we have elected to use the fair value method to value our portfolio of finance receivables acquired in January 2018 and thereafter. Our valuation policies and procedures have been developed by our Accounting department in conjunction with our Risk department and with consultation with outside valuation experts. Our policies and procedures have been approved by our Chief Executive and our Board of Directors and include methodologies for valuation, internal reporting, calibration and back testing. Our periodic review of valuations includes an analysis of changes in fair value measurements and documentation of the reasons for such changes. There is little available third-party information such as broker quotes or pricing services available to assist us in our valuation process. Our level 3, unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing similar receivables and are based on the best information available in the circumstances. They include such inputs as estimates for the magnitude and timing of net charge-offs and the rate of amortization of the portfolio of finance receivable. Significant changes in any of those inputs in isolation would have a significant impact on our fair value measurement. The table below presents a reconciliation of the finance receivables measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below compares the fair values of these finance receivables to their contractual balances for the periods shown: The following table provides certain qualitative information about our level 3 fair value measurements: The following table summarizes the delinquency status using the contractual balance of these finance receivables measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Repossessed vehicle inventory, which is included in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheet, is measured at fair value using level 2 assumptions based on our actual loss experience on sale of repossessed vehicles. At December 31, 2018, the finance receivables related to the repossessed vehicles in inventory totaled $33.5 million. We have applied a valuation adjustment, or loss allowance, of $24.6 million, which is based on a recovery rate of approximately 27%, resulting in an estimated fair value and carrying amount of $8.9 million. The fair value and carrying amount of the repossessed inventory at December 31, 2017 was $9.7 million after applying a valuation adjustment of $24.0 million. CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS There were no transfers in or out of level 1 or level 2 assets and liabilities for 2018 and 2017. We have no level 3 assets or liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. The estimated fair values of financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows: CONSUMER PORTFOLIO SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15) Subsequent Events On January 23, 2019 we executed our first securitization of 2019. In the transaction, qualified institutional buyers purchased $254.4 million of asset-backed notes secured by $265.0 million in automobile receivables purchased by us. The sold notes, issued by CPS Auto Receivables Trust 2019-A, consist of five classes. Ratings of the notes were provided by Standard & Poor’s, and DBRS and were based on the structure of the transaction, the historical performance of similar receivables and our experience as a servicer. The weighted average yield on the notes is approximately 4.22%. The 2019-A transaction has initial credit enhancement consisting of a cash deposit equal to 1.00% of the original receivable pool balance. The final enhancement level requires accelerated payment of principal on the notes to reach overcollateralization of the lesser of 8.50% of the original receivable pool balance, or 18.70% of the then outstanding pool balance. The transaction utilizes a pre-funding structure, in which CPS sold approximately $166.1 million of receivables on January 23, 2019 and sold $98.9 million of additional receivables on February 13, 2019. The transaction was a private offering of securities, not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any state securities law. On February 22, 2019 we amended our $100 million warehouse credit line with Fortress Investment Group extending the revolving period to February 2021 followed by an amortization period through February 2023.

Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 19,800 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 13,200 issued patents and 6,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend . Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter. Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 25,000 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following: Mission, Culture, and Engagement Our History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global company achieving many important industry firsts along the way.

We are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employees to take advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly rated, and we provide specialized development programs for our employees. Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. 12 Table of Contents Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $ 3.9 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 1A.

Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies. Also, Intel has developed and released their own high-end discrete GPUs, including gaming focused discrete GPUs. We also compete with Intel in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and Adaptive SoC products. Intel’s position in the microprocessor, and integrated graphics chipset markets, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. We experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain in the second half of 2022. Uncertain global economic conditions have and may in the future adversely impact our business. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates or recession, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for 16 Table of Contents our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in previous downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. In the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments, which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past, revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation® 5, Microsoft® Xbox TM Series S and Microsoft® Xbox TM Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. 17 Table of Contents The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures, including at various times vaccination and testing requirements and recordkeeping, quarantines, business closures, travel bans, and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility, to contain the virus. Various state and federal rules are issued and updated on an ongoing basis, at times in conflict and/or with minimal notice. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these changing measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. While our employees gradually return to office, we continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Although some public health measures have eased, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our employees to health risks. It is uncertain as to when all health measures put in place to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be lifted. If there are further waves of the virus, health measures may be reimplemented and we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner that may impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation, quarantine, lockdown measures, unavailability of COVID 19 tests, travel restrictions or illness, a reluctance or refusal to vaccinate, or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of time, we may not be able to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce. Even when COVID-19 health measures are lifted or modified, our employees’ ability or willingness to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operations. COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We have taken efforts to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates at a reasonable cost, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. If the supply of our products to customers is delayed, reduced or canceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturers, back-end manufacturers, warehouses, partners, suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures, border and port restrictions or closures, transportation delays, lockdown measures, labor shortages or workforce mobility limitations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases, or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amounts due to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Even in times of strong demand for our products, the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19 and such demand may not be sustainable over the longer term. COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our Revolving Credit Agreement and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operations and capital expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contracting capital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19, it may have an adverse effect on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are unpredictable and highly uncertain, including the continued spread, duration and severity of the outbreak, the appearances of new variants of COVID-19, the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective treatments and vaccines, and public health measures and actions taken throughout the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 Table of Contents The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality (VR) experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, ease of use and functionality of software design tools, completeness of applicable software solutions, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is expanding its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like the ARM architecture. Increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. 19 Table of Contents Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Operational and Technology Risks We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for microprocessor and GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also utilize TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. for our integrated circuits (IC) in the form of programmable logic devices. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. Our third-party package assembly partners are responsible for packaging technology used to fabricate our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the reduced quantities of affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our microprocessor and GPU products at 7 nm or smaller nodes and our newest IC products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require onerous prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 20 Table of Contents Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, yield, cycle times, quality assurance, price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers (or their subcontractors) suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social, economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those manufacturers, we may be unable to timely secure an alternative supply for any specific product. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the Amendment). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD was obligated in 2022 and is obligated in 2023 to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain suppliers. 21 Table of Contents Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one equipment or materials supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party manufacturers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of product design, process technology and packaging technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, packaging technology failures, process technology failures or a combination of some or all of these. Our third-party manufacturers are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party manufacturers experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or we may experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party manufacturers will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process or packaging technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when our third-party manufacturers are implementing new process or packaging technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product microprocessor and GPU portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, we rely on TSMC, UMC and our other foundries to produce wafers with competitive performance attributes for our IC products. Therefore, the foundries, particularly TSMC which manufactures our newest IC products, must be able to transition to advanced manufacturing process technologies and increased wafer sizes, produce wafers at acceptable yields and deliver them in a timely manner. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and 22 Table of Contents technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. The products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. AMD and companies like AMD and our vendors and customers have been increasingly subject to cybersecurity attempts and threats. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD 23 Table of Contents and our providers has presented additional operational risks and cybersecurity attack vectors to our IT systems. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber threats have and may come into our network through malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software, compromised commercial software or security vulnerabilities in our products or those of a third party that are being used by attackers prior to mitigations being put in place, such as zero-day attacks. Cyber-attacks have and may come into our IT system through the compromise of our users’ access credentials. Users’ access credentials can be compromised by phishing, vishing, smishing, multi-factor authentication (MFA) prompt bombing, hacking, or other social engineering, cybersecurity, or theft activities. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent and have and may cause a disruption to our business. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents or mitigate quickly enough to stop an attack. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information or personally identifiable information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply or a breach of personally identifiable information could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments or litigation by other entities. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations. We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. We also provide sensitive information to vendors, customers and contractors. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data and sensitive information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results. We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning system, which could materially adversely affect us. We are currently upgrading our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to help us manage our operations and financial reporting. The adoption of a new ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruption s to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditure overruns, and data migration issues. If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management’s attention and resources, negatively impacting our operating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may not operate as we expect it to 24 Table of Contents and cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, in the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products. Excess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Other factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes use of third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, or laws are adopted that affect our use of third party intellectual property in certain regions or products, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that we use to design, support and sell, and our customers utilize to support and/or use our product offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production 25 Table of Contents of current or future products that are based on, utilized in, or support our products, or laws are adopted that result in the same, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, 26 Table of Contents power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, insider threat attacks, unauthorized system or data modifications, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, geographic requirements, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 27 Table of Contents We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our third-party manufacturers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. Since that time, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy, including policies with respect to China and Russia. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain as the United States continues to add more Chinese companies to the Entity List and more regulations targeted to advanced computing, semiconductor manufacturing, and AI. Further, the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. BIS has issued new requirements that prevent us from shipping MI250 and MI250X integrated circuits to China and Russia without a license. BIS may possibly issue new licensing requirements and regulatory controls in the future. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Export control restrictions may adversely impact the ability of our research and development teams located outside of the United States from executing our product roadmaps in a timely manner or at all. We may, from time to time, receive technical data from third parties that is subject to the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR), which are administered by the U.S. Department of State. EAR and ITAR govern the export and re-export of certain AMD products, including FPGAs, and the transfer of related technologies, whether in the U.S. or abroad, and the provision of services. We are required to maintain an internal compliance program and security infrastructure to meet EAR and ITAR requirements. An inability to obtain the required export licenses, or to predict when they will be granted, increases the difficulties of forecasting shipments. In addition, security or compliance program failures that could result in penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to overseas customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results . 28 Table of Contents If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, and exposure to greater-than-anticipated income tax liabilities as a result of changes in tax rules and regulations, changes in interpretation of tax rules and regulations, or unfavorable assessments from tax audits, any of which could affect our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations. We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Our income tax obligations could be affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, changes to our corporate operating structure, intercompany arrangements, and tax planning strategies. Our income tax expense is computed based on tax rates at the time of the respective financial period. Our future effective tax rates, financial condition and results from operations could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in the tax rules and regulations or the interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result from the current examinations. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our effective tax rates, financial condition, and results of operations. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits or litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 17 - Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. 29 Table of Contents With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. For the manufacturing of our products, these laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our current or former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. 30 Table of Contents Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not been identified could exist at our other facilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. In addition to our company, customers, governments and authorities continue to be focused on eliminating risks of forced labor in supply chains which may increase the cost of our compliance program. For example, the United States Uyghur Forced Labor Prevent Act prohibits goods mined, produced or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China, or by certain entities, from entering the United States under the presumption of being made with forced labor. Germany’s federal procurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, has issued supply chain labor requirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have enacted laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these occurrences, if any, that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product. Merger, Acquisition and Integration Risks Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. 31 Table of Contents For example, on February 14, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Xilinx and on May 26, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Pensando. While we believe these acquisitions will result in certain benefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations, achieving these anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and the acquired companies’ businesses together. It is not certain that the acquired companies can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: our inability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the integration; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the acquisitions on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of, the acquired companies’ employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and the acquired companies operate; potential litigation associated with the acquisitions; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and the acquired companies’ financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the acquisitions may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions and negatively impact the combined company. If we cannot successfully integrate our and the acquired companies’ businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example, we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. 32 Table of Contents Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. We account for certain acquisitions, including the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed, at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we recorded significant goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, we determine that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, we would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of goodwill and may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Risks The agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of the Assumed Xilinx Notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 contains various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: create liens on certain assets to secure debt, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions; and consolidate with, merge into or sell, convey or lease all or substantially all of our assets to any other person. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of Xilinx, we entered into supplemental indentures for the Assumed Xilinx Notes pursuant to which all obligations of Xilinx under the Assumed Xilinx Notes are unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by us. The indentures governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes also contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all our assets, taken as a whole, to another person. We also have a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion (Revolving Credit Agreement). Our Revolving Credit Agreement contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur liens and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). In addition, our Revolving Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Agreement contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $500 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Agreement (to the extent such default (other than the failure to repay indebtedness) would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness). The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 2.125% Notes or 33 Table of Contents the lenders under our Revolving Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion . Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also, if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. In addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. General Risks Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also depend on third-party subcontractors to provide shipment services. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. 34 Table of Contents The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight rates; changes to macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates, inflation and recession; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Recently, the United States and other countries and coalitions have issued sanctions and revisions to export control and other regulations against Russia, Belarus or the DNR or LNR regions of Ukraine, due to the conflict in Ukraine. Also, geopolitical changes between China and Taiwan could disrupt the operations of our Taiwan based third-party wafer foundries, manufacturing facilities and subcontractors, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results . In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara and San Jose operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced extreme weather such as prolonged heat waves, wildfires and freezing. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production and shipment delays, general business interruptions, the inability to obtain, or delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, penalties or a loss of export privileges, as well as stringent licensing restrictions that may make our products less attractive to international customers, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. 35 Table of Contents Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $4 billion of our common stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February 2022, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to our Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to $8 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the Repurchase Program). The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2022, we have 6 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use throughout the world. These facilities include 5 million square feet of leased space and 1 million square feet of owned space. Our headquarters are located in Santa Clara, California, and we have significant operations in Austin, Texas; San Jose, California; Shanghai, China; Markham, Ontario, Canada; Longmont, Colorado; Dublin, Ireland; Singapore; and Bangalore and Hyderabad, India. We also have a number of regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021. Overview 2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry’s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers. Our 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021. We took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations. 40 Table of Contents We also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture. Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, business combination, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our original equipment manufacturers (OEM) customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers. We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both. Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis. Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis. We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable. Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. 42 Table of Contents Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing developed technology, in-process research and development, customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Goodwill. Goodwill is the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment level. Our goodwill is contained within three reporting units: Data Center, Gaming and Embedded. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of our reporting units to determine if the fair values of those units exceed their carrying values and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists to help in determining the fair value of our reporting units. The fair values of our reporting units are estimated using a combination of the income approach, which requires estimating the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting unit. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of our reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of our ability to execute on our roadmap and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, the determination of an appropriate control premium that a market participant would apply to a reporting unit, and the determination of appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. 43 Table of Contents The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of our reporting units are the sales and earnings growth rates (including long-term growth rates) and discount rates. Long-term growth rates are dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment and inflation. As a result, long-term growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth or an increased competitive environment. Discount rates, which are consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, are based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rates may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, prolonged and continuing inflationary pressures, volatility in the equity and debt markets and other factors that otherwise create or exacerbate risks in our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units’ goodwill. Based on our annual impairment testing, the fair values of all of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets. Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, we estimate impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. Income Taxes . In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2022, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. 44 Table of Contents Results of Operations During the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, we changed our reporting segments to align our financial reporting with how we manage our business in strategic end markets. This is consistent with how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses our financial performance and allocates resources. As a result, we report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 4 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (In millions) Net revenue: Data Center $ 6,043 $ 3,694 Client 6,201 6,887 Gaming 6,805 5,607 Embedded 4,552 246 Total net revenue $ 23,601 $ 16,434 Operating income (loss): Data Center $ 1,848 $ 991 Client 1,190 2,088 Gaming 953 934 Embedded 2,252 44 All Other (4,979) (409) Total operating income (loss) $ 1,264 $ 3,648 Data Center Data Center net revenue of $6 billion in 2022 increased by 64%, compared to net revenue of $3.7 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors. Data Center operating income was $1.8 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $991 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. Client Client net revenue of $6.2 billion in 2022 decreased by 10%, compared to net revenue of $6.9 billion in 2021, primarily driven by a 24% decrease in unit shipment, partially offset by a 19% increase in average selling price. The decrease in unit shipments was due to challenging PC market conditions and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain experienced during the second half of 2022. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $1.2 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $2.1 billion in 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by lower revenue and higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. 45 Table of Contents Gaming Gaming net revenue of $6.8 billion in 2022 increased by 21%, compared to net revenue of $5.6 billion in 2021. The increase in net revenue was driven by higher semi-custom product sales due to higher demand for gaming console SoCs, partially offset by lower gaming graphics sales due to a decrease in unit shipments driven by soft consumer demand given weakened macroeconomic conditions experienced in the second half of 2022. Gaming operating income was $953 million in 2022, compared to operating income of $934 million in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. Embedded Embedded net revenue of $4.6 billion in 2022 increased significantly, compared to net revenue of $246 million in 2021. The significant increase in net revenue was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue as a result of the acquisition of Xilinx in February 2022. Embedded operating income was $2.3 billion in 2022, compared to operating income of $44 million in 2021. The significant increase in operating income was primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product revenue. All Other All Other operating loss of $5.0 billion in 2022 primarily consisted of $3.5 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $1.1 billion of stock-based compensation expense, and $452 million of acquisition-related costs, which primarily include transaction costs, amortization of Xilinx inventory fair value step-up adjustment, and depreciation related to the Xilinx fixed assets fair value step-up adjustment, certain compensation charges related to the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, and licensing gain. All Other operating loss of $409 million in 2021 primarily consisted of $379 million of stock-based compensation expense and $42 million of acquisition-related costs. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2022 and 2021: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (In millions, except for percentages) Net revenue $ 23,601 $ 16,434 Cost of sales 11,550 8,505 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 1,448 — Gross profit 10,603 7,929 Gross margin 45 % 48 % Research and development 5,005 2,845 Marketing, general and administrative 2,336 1,448 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 2,100 — Licensing gain (102) (12) Interest expense (88) (34) Other income, net 8 55 Income tax provision (benefit) (122) 513 Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2022 compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. 46 Table of Contents Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $5.0 billion in 2022 increased by $2.2 billion, or 76%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily driven by strategic investments across all of our segments, including an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $2.3 billion in 2022 increased by $888 million, or 61%, compared to $1.4 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in headcount through acquisitions and organic growth, go-to-market activities, and acquisition-related costs. Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles In 2022, cost of sales and operating expense included $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of amortization expense from intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando. Licensing Gain During 2022, we recognized $102 million of licensing gain from milestone achievement and royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We recognized a licensing gain from royalty income of $12 million for the year ended December 25, 2021. Interest Expense Interest expense of $88 million in 2022 increased by $54 million compared to $34 million in 2021, primarily due to interest expense from the 2.95% Senior Notes due 2024 and the 2.375% Senior Notes due 2030 (together, the Assumed Xilinx Notes) and the 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued in 2022. Other Income (Expense), net Other income (expense), net is primarily comprised of interest income from short-term investments, changes in valuation of equity investments and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Other income, net was $8 million in 2022 compared to $55 million of Other income, net in 2021. The change was primarily due to a $62 million decrease in the fair value of equity investments in 2022 compared to an increase in fair value of $56 million from equity investments in 2021, partially offset by $65 million of interest income driven mainly by rising interest rates in 2022 compared to losses from conversion of our convertible debt of $7 million in 2021. Income Tax Provision (Benefit) We recorded an income tax benefit of $122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $261 million foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit and $241 million of research and development tax credits. Through the end of fiscal year 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 66% in 2022 and 72% in 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. 47 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to $3.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by the $2.4 billion of cash and $1.6 billion of short-term investments acquired from the Xilinx acquisition, $1.0 billion from the debt issuance of our 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes, and cash flows from operations, partially offset by stock repurchases and cash paid for the acquisition of Pensando. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 73% as of December 31, 2022, and 91% as of December 25, 2021. Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2022 and 2021 were as follows: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,565 $ 3,521 Investing activities 1,999 (686) Financing activities (3,264) (1,895) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,300 $ 940 Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022, which consisted primarily of $1.5 billion of the Xilinx Notes assumed as part of the Xilinx acquisition and $1.0 billion of 3.924% Notes and 4.393% Notes issued during the year, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021, respectively. We repaid $312 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes that matured in August 2022. On April 29, 2022, we entered into a revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Agreement) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and other banks identified therein as lenders. The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. On November 3, 2022, we established a new commercial paper program where we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, we had unconditional purchase commitments of approximately $8.6 billion, of which $6.5 billion are in fiscal year 2023. On an ongoing basis, we work with our suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility and commercial paper program will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. Operating Activities Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations consist primarily of cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures. 48 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion in 2022, primarily due to our net income of $1.3 billion in 2022, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $4.1 billion and net cash outflows of $1.8 billion from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $1.4 billion increase in inventories driven primarily by build of advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products, a $1.1 billion increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, and a $1.2 billion increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2022, offset by an $931 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $546 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven mainly by higher customer-related accruals. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $2 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $4.3 billion and cash acquired as part of the acquisition of Xilinx of $2.4 billion, partially offset by higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.7 billion, cash used in the acquisition of Pensando of $1.5 billion and $450 million for purchases of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in 2022, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $3.7 billion under the Repurchase Program, higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $406 million and repayment of debt of $312 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of debt of $991 million and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $167 million. Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the Repurchase Program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 49 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income instruments, time deposits and commercial paper. Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. In accordance with our investment policy, we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer based upon the issuer's credit rating. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 50 basis-point (half percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at December 31, 2022 would have affected the fair value of our cash equivalent and investment portfolio by approximately $2.9 million. As of December 31, 2022, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021.

Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Non-custom products The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. 57 Table of Contents The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Constraints of variable consideration have not been material. Custom products Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Gaming segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Inventories The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required . 58 Table of Contents Business Combinations The Company is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The acquisition method of accounting requires the Company to allocate the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquiree based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue growth rates and margins, future changes in technology, time to recreate customer relationships, useful lives, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions that management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or elects to bypass the qualitative test, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company’s quantitative impairment analysis uses a combination of the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows of a reporting unit, and the market approach, which uses financial ratios of comparable companies to arrive at an estimated value for the reporting units. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the income approach include assessments of macroeconomic conditions, growth rates of reporting units in the near- and long-term, expectations of the Company’s ability to execute on roadmaps and projections, and the discount rate applied to cash flows. Significant estimates used in the market approach include the identification of comparable companies for each reporting unit, and the determination of the appropriate multiples to apply to a reporting unit based on adjustments and consideration of specific attributes of that reporting unit. If a reporting unit’s fair value is determined to be less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Long-Lived and Intangible Assets Long-lived and intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist and at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment indicators are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. When indicators of impairment exist and assets are held for use, the Company estimates future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the related asset groups. In the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded value of the assets, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group or based on appraisals. Factors affecting impairment of assets held for use include the ability of the specific assets to generate separately identifiable positive cash flows. When assets are removed from operations and held for sale, the Company estimates impairment losses as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value. Market conditions are among the factors affecting impairment of assets held for sale. Changes in any of these factors could necessitate impairment recognition in future periods for assets held for use or assets held for sale. 59 Table of Contents Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. Investments Available for Sale Debt Securities. The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Classification of available-for-sale debt securities as current or non-current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Non-marketable Securities. The Company’s investments in non-marketable securities of privately-held companies are accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. The Company's periodic assessment of impairment is made by considering available evidence, including the investee’s general market and industry conditions and product development status. The Company also assesses the investee’s ability to meet business milestones, its financial condition, and near-term prospects, including the rate at which the investee is using its cash, the investee’s need for possible additional funding at a lower valuation and any bona fide offer to purchase the investee. Fair Value Measurements The Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies, which are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative. Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 60 Table of Contents Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of one to 15 years for equipment, 34 to 44 years for buildings, and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of the majority of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. For certain foreign subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Gains or losses arising from translation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (i.e., cumulative translation adjustment) are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $ 683 million, $ 578 million and $ 314 million, respectively. 61 Table of Contents Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Contingencies From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for the United States GILTI tax from recording the tax impact in the period it is incurred to recognizing deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. The change is considered preferable based on the Company’s facts and circumstances as it provides better and more timely information of expected future income tax liabilities arising from temporary tax differences primarily associated with the Xilinx acquisition. As a result of the acquisition, the Company recorded $27.3 billion of identified intangible assets (refer to Note 5 - Business Combinations), of which $16.9 billion are related to foreign operations which will be amortized to income from operations over the assets’ estimated useful lives, but for which the Company will not receive a tax deduction under GILTI. This accounting policy change resulted in the recording of $857 million of deferred tax liabilities in connection with the Xilinx acquisition as disclosed in Note 14 - Income Taxes. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2022, it resulted in a decrease in the income tax provision with a corresponding increase to net income of $296 million and an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.19, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy. This accounting policy change had no material impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial statements. 62 Table of Contents Accrued Interest on Unrecognized Tax Benefits. Prior to 2022, the Company reported any interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of Interest expense and reported any related penalties as a component of Income tax provision (benefit). In 2022, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for tax interest expense from Interest expense to the Income tax provision (benefit) line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This change in classification is considered preferable as it i) better aligns classification of tax interest with the substance of the underlying tax positions, which are managed inclusive of interest, ii) allows for greater visibility to the cost of the Company’s debt and other financing activities, and iii) better aligns with common industry practice and provides increased comparability. This accounting policy change resulted in a decrease in Interest expense and corresponding increase to i) Income before income taxes and equity income and ii) Income tax provision (benefit) as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of $11 million in 2022. This accounting policy change had an immaterial effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2021 and 2020, and the Company did not revise its previously issued consolidated financial statements for these fiscal years. This accounting policy change had no impact to net income or basic and diluted earnings per share, or to financial statements besides the Consolidated Statements of Operations, for any period, as compared to the computation under the previous accounting policy. NOTE 3 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information Accounts Receivable, net As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, Accounts receivable, net included unbilled accounts receivable of $ 1.1 billion and $ 329 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one year was $ 247 million, of which $ 213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less. Revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 24 %, 23 % and 18 % of the Company’s revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NOTE 4 – Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management’s judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company’s disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company’s CODM assesses the company’s financial performance and allocates resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted. The Company’s four reportable segments are: • the Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers; • the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets for desktop and notebook personal computers; • the Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and • the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain. 64 Table of Contents The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2022, 2021 and 2020.

The recorded purchase consideration of $ 1.7 billion is net of deferred cash compensation requiring future services and other customary closing adjustments. The acquisition of Pensando and its leading distributed services platform expands the Company’s ability to offer leadership solutions for cloud, enterprise, and edge customers. 66 Table of Contents The purchase consideration was preliminarily allocated as follows: (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 111 Accounts receivable 31 Inventory 66 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 43 Property and equipment 11 Deferred tax assets 22 Acquisition-related intangibles 349 Total Assets 633 Accounts payable 15 Accrued and other liabilities 61 Total Liabilities 76 Fair value of net assets acquired 557 Goodwill 1,098 Total purchase consideration $ 1,655 The Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the preliminary estimates of their fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management. The fair values are subject to adjustment for up to one year after the close of the transaction as additional information is obtained. Any adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation identified during the measurement period are recognized in the period in which the adjustments are determined. Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation since the completion of the acquisition resulted in an immaterial decrease to goodwill. Goodwill arising from the Pensando acquisition was assigned to the Company’s Data Center segment. Goodwill was primarily attributed to expanded market opportunities expected to be achieved from the integration of Pensando. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. 67 Table of Contents Following are details of the purchase consideration allocated to acquired intangible assets: Fair Value Weighted-average estimated useful life (In millions) (In years) Developed technology (1) $ 60 4 years Customer relationships (2) 34 3 years Customer backlog (3) 16 1 year Product trademarks (4) 19 5 years Identified intangible assets subject to amortization 129 In-process research and development (IPR&D) not subject to amortization (5) 220 N/A Total identified intangible assets acquired $ 349 1. The fair value of developed technology was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. 2. Customer relationships represent the fair value of existing contractual relationships and customer loyalty determined based on existing relationships using the income approach, specifically the with and without method. 3. Customer backlog represents the fair value of non-cancellable customer contract orders using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. 4. Product trademarks primarily relate to the Pensando product-related trademarks, and the fair value was determined by applying the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method. 5. The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales and operating expenses. IPR&D consists of projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 220 million for the fair value of these projects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects will be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. From the Pensando Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022, the Consolidated Statements of Operations include immaterial revenue and operating results attributable to Pensando, which are reported under the Data Center segment. In 2022, Pensando acquisition-related costs of $ 102 million was recorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Acquisition-related costs are primarily comprised of direct transaction costs, fair value adjustments for acquired inventory and certain compensation charges. The Company may incur additional acquisition-related costs in the future related to the acquisition. Xilinx Acquisition On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Xilinx, a leading provider of adaptive computing solutions, for a total purchase consideration of $ 48.8 billion ($ 46.4 billion, net of cash acquired of $ 2.4 billion). The acquisition of Xilinx expands the Company’s product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company now offers FPGAs, Adaptive SoC products and ACAP products. The purchase consideration consisted of $ 48.5 billion of fair value of 429 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders and $ 275 million of fair value of replacement equity awards attributable to services rendered pre-combination. As the transaction closed prior to the opening of markets on the Xilinx Acquisition Date, the fair value of the common stock issued to Xilinx stockholders was based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on February 11, 2022 of $ 113.18 per share. The financial results of Xilinx are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the Xilinx Acquisition Date to December 31, 2022 and are reported under the Embedded and Data Center segments. 68 Table of Contents The purchase consideration was allocated as follows: (In millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,366 Short-term investments 1,582 Accounts receivable 299 Inventories 539 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 61 Property and equipment 692 Operating lease right-of-use assets 61 Acquisition-related intangibles 27,308 Deferred tax assets 15 Other non-current assets 418 Total Assets 33,341 Accounts payable 116 Accrued liabilities 634 Other current liabilities 185 Long-term debt 1,474 Long-term operating lease liabilities 45 Deferred tax liabilities 4,346 Other long-term liabilities 532 Total Liabilities 7,332 Fair value of net assets acquired 26,009 Goodwill 22,784 Total purchase consideration $ 48,793 The Company allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimates of their fair values, which were determined using generally accepted valuation techniques based on estimates and assumptions made by management. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of Xilinx was assigned to the Embedded and Data Center segments. Goodwill was primarily attributed to increased synergies expected to be achieved from the integration of Xilinx. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Following are details of the purchase consideration allocated to acquired intangible assets: Fair Value Weighted-average estimated useful life (In millions) (In years) Developed technology (1) $ 12,295 16 years Customer relationships (2) 12,290 14 years Customer backlog (3) 793 1 year Corporate trade name (4) 65 1 year Product trademarks (4) 895 12 years Identified intangible assets subject to amortization 26,338 In-process research and development (IPR&D) not subject to amortization (5) 970 N/A Total identified intangible assets acquired $ 27,308 1.

Customer backlog represents the fair value of non-cancellable customer contract orders using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. 4. Corporate trade name and product trademarks primarily relate to the Xilinx brand and product-related trademarks, respectively, and the fair values were determined by applying the income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method. 5. The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the identified intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of sales and operating expenses. IPR&D consists of projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the Company recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $ 970 million for the fair value of these projects, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, these projects are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these projects may be impaired. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, the Company will begin to amortize the intangible assets over their estimated useful life. The Company also assumed unvested restricted stock units with estimated fair value o f $ 1.2 billion, of which $ 275 million was included as a component of the purchase consideration and $ 951 million will be recognized as expense subsequent to the acquisition. The Consolidated Statements of Operations include the following revenue and operating income attributable to Xilinx in 2022: 2022 (In millions) Net revenue $ 4,612 Operating income $ 2,247 Operating income attributable to Xilinx recorded under the Embedded and Data Center segments does not include $4.2 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs, which are recorded under the “All Other” segment. In 2022, Xilinx acquisition-related costs of $ 350 million were recorded under Cost of sales, Research and development, and Marketing, general and administrative expenses on the C ompany’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The difference between the fair value at the Xilinx Acquisition Date and the principal outstanding of the Assumed Xilinx Notes is being amortized through interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Assumed Xilinx Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company with semi-annual fixed interest payments due on June 1 and December 1. The indentures governing the Assumed Xilinx Notes contain various covenants which limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, create certain liens on principal property or the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal property, and consolidate or merge with, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another person. 3.924% Senior Notes Due 2032 and 4.393% Senior Notes Due 2052 On June 9, 2022, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.924 % Notes and 4.393 % Notes. The 3.924 % Notes and 4.393 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2022. The 3.924 % and 4.393 % Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture dated June 9, 2022 between the Company and US Bank Trust Company, National Association as trustee. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 3.924 % Notes and 4.393 % Notes was $1.0 billion. 73 Table of Contents The Company may redeem some or all of the 3.924 % Notes and 4.393 % Notes prior to March 1, 2032 and December 1, 2051, respectively, at a price equal to the greater of the present value of the principal amount and future interest through the maturity of the 3.924 % Notes or 4.393 % Notes or 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 3.924 % Notes or 4.393 % Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the indenture, at a repurchase price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 3.924 % Notes and 4.393 % Notes. 2.125% Notes During 2022 , activity on the 2.125% Notes was immaterial. 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012, the Company issued $ 500 million of its 7.50 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 7.50 % Notes).

The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a five-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $3.0 billion (subject to certain terms and conditions). Revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be Secure Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Loans or Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) at the Company's option. Each SOFR Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable SOFR Rate plus a margin based on the Company's Debt Ratings (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) from time to time of between 0.625% and 1.250%. Each Base Rate Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) plus a margin based on the Company's Debt Ratings from time to time of between 0.000% and 0.250%. In addition, the Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee based on the Company's Debt Ratings from time to time of between 0.050% and 0.125% (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains a sustainability-linked pricing component which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on the Company meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants and events of default applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries.

Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis As of December 31, 2022, the Company had non-marketable securities in privately-held companies of $ 137 million. The balance of non-marketable securities in privately-held companies as of December 25, 2021 was not material. Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Accounting Hedges The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 24 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $ 1.9 billion and $ 894 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts, recorded as a liability, was $ 27 million as of December 31, 2022. The fair value of these contracts as of December 25, 2021 was not material. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $ 485 million and $ 291 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. The cash flows associated with derivative instruments as cash flow hedging instruments are classified in the same category in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as the cash flows of the related items. 76 Table of Contents NOTE 10 – Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities and trade receivables. The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral. The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18 % of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20 % and 15 % of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company. NOTE 11 – Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income for basic earnings per share $ 1,320 $ 3,162 $ 2,490 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Interest expense related to the 2.125% Notes — — 1 Net income for diluted earnings per share $ 1,320 $ 3,162 $ 2,491 Denominator Basic weighted-average shares 1,561 1,213 1,184 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity plans and warrants 10 16 20 2.125% Notes — — 3 Diluted weighted-average shares 1,571 1,229 1,207 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.85 $ 2.61 $ 2.10 Diluted $ 0.84 $ 2.57 $ 2.06 Potential shares from employee equity plans and the impact from the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes up to the conversion date, totaling 16 million and 2 million shares for 2022 and 2021, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 77 Table of Contents NOTE 12 – Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Common Stock Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Balance, beginning of period 1,207 1,211 1,170 Common stock issued in the acquisition of Xilinx 429 — — Common stock issued under employee equity plans 17 12 14 Repurchases of common stock ( 36 ) ( 17 ) — Common stock repurchases for tax withholding on equity awards ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) Issuance of common stock to settle convertible debt — 3 28 Balance, end of period 1,612 1,207 1,211 Stock Repurchase Program In May 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing up to $4 billion of the Company’s common stock (Existing Repurchase Program). In February 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program in addition to the Existing Repurchase Program to purchase up to $8 billion of outstanding common stock in the open market (collectively referred to as the “Repurchase Program”). During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 36.3 million shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program for $ 3.7 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $ 6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan). Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs. Stock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0 % to 250 % of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award. 78 Table of Contents ESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 15 % of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 32 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 28 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan. In addition, the Company had 36 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the 2017 plan. With the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company assumed the Xilinx, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) and may grant stock options and awards under this plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 18 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants under the 2007 Plan. Valuation and Expense Stock-based compensation expense was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 29 $ 5 $ 6 Research and development 697 246 173 Marketing, general, and administrative 355 128 95 Total stock-based compensation expense before income taxes 1,081 379 274 Income tax benefit ( 179 ) ( 58 ) ( 42 ) Total stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 902 $ 321 $ 232 Stock Options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 44.35 , $ 46.07 and $ 38.49 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Expected volatility 51.28 % 51.77 % 57.87 % Risk-free interest rate 3.00 % 0.69 % 0.18 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected life (in years) 4.75 4.55 4.30 The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding.

NOTE 14 – Income Taxes Income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) U.S. $ 2,093 $ 3,528 $ 1,213 Non-U.S. ( 895 ) 147 67 Total pre-tax income including equity income in investee $ 1,198 $ 3,675 $ 1,280 81 Table of Contents The income tax provision (benefit) consists of: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Current: U.S. federal $ 1,191 $ 112 $ — U.S. state and local 31 11 5 Non-U.S. 161 82 8 Total 1,383 205 13 Deferred: U.S. federal ( 1,365 ) 320 ( 1,193 ) U.S. state and local ( 26 ) ( 7 ) ( 28 ) Non-U.S. ( 114 ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) Total ( 1,505 ) 308 ( 1,223 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ ( 122 ) $ 513 $ ( 1,210 ) The table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total income tax provision (benefit). Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Statutory federal income tax expense at 21% $ 252 $ 772 $ 269 State taxes (benefit) ( 3 ) 1 ( 6 ) Foreign rate detriment (benefit) 195 71 ( 3 ) GILTI and other foreign inclusion ( 105 ) — — Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction ( 261 ) ( 147 ) — Research credits ( 241 ) ( 78 ) ( 57 ) Stock-based and non-deductible compensation 10 ( 125 ) ( 116 ) Valuation allowance change — 3 ( 1,301 ) Other 31 16 4 Income tax provision (benefit) $ ( 122 ) $ 513 $ ( 1,210 ) The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $ 122 million in 2022 and an income tax provision of $ 513 million in 2021, representing effective tax rates of (10%) and 14%, respectively. The reduction in income tax expense in 2022 was primarily due to the lower pre-tax income coupled with a $ 261 million FDII tax benefit and $241 million of research and development (R&D) tax credits. Beginning in 2022, provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require the Company to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures rather than deducting the costs as incurred. The capitalization resulted in an increase in 2022 taxable income which also increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. Additionally, there was a pre-tax loss incurred outside of the U.S. primarily due to the GAAP amortization of Xilinx acquisition-related items and therefore, the Company recorded a corresponding tax benefit associated with the reversal of the previously established GILTI deferred tax liability. As a part of the Xilinx acquisition and as a result of certain employment and operational commitments the Company has made in Singapore, the Company has been granted a Development and Expansion Incentive (DEI) that is effective through 2031. The DEI reduces the local tax on Singapore income from a statutory rate of 17% to 5% through 2031. Due to the current year pre-tax loss, the Company did not receive any income tax or EPS benefit. 82 Table of Contents The Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision in 2021 was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $ 147 million of FDII benefit, $ 78 million of R&D tax credits, and $ 125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’ compensation. The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes and $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 were as follows: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryovers $ 1,031 $ 920 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 835 631 Employee benefits not currently deductible 214 164 Federal and state tax credit carryovers 631 319 Foreign R&D and investment tax credits 578 547 Capitalized costs 65 121 Lease liability 161 124 Capitalized R&D 943 — Other 85 27 Total deferred tax assets 4,543 2,853 Less: valuation allowance ( 2,078 ) ( 1,735 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 2,465 1,118 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles ( 3,430 ) ( 50 ) Right-of-use assets ( 151 ) ( 110 ) Undistributed foreign earnings ( 35 ) ( 24 ) GILTI ( 633 ) — Other ( 92 ) ( 15 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 4,341 ) ( 199 ) Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 1,876 ) $ 919 As a result of the acquisition of Xilinx, the Company recorded $4.3 billion of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets, including $857 million of GILTI net deferred tax liability. Additionally, as the result of the new R&D capitalization tax law effective in 2022, the capitalized amounts resulted in increased current year taxable income, but which are deductible as amortized in future periods. Therefore, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the capitalized R&D expenditures. 83 Table of Contents The movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 1,735 $ 1,576 $ 2,867 Charges (reductions) to income tax expense and other accounts* 112 3 ( 1,301 ) Acquisition-related 231 — — Net recoveries + — 156 10 Balance at end of year $ 2,078 $ 1,735 $ 1,576 * Amounts recorded in 2020 reflect release of valuation allowances. + The net recoveries for all were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits. Under current U.S. tax law, the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be subject to withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $460 million as of December 31, 2022. Through the end of fiscal year 2022, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $2.1 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. The Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 31, 2022, were $ 435 million and $ 476 million, respectively. Net operating losses (NOLs) may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. $71 million of U.S. federal NOLs will expire between 2023 and 2037, and $364 million of federal NOLs have no expiration date, and the state NOLs will expire at various dates through 2042. The difference between the amount of federal NOLs which are recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as deferred tax assets and their related valuation allowance, and the amounts reported on the Company’s tax returns are the result of uncertain tax positions the Company has taken during the current year and for which an income tax reserve has been recorded. The federal tax credits of $ 12 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2042. The state tax credits of $722 million will expire at various dates between 2023 through 2038 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $ 595 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040. The Company also recorded $142 million of current tax payable as of the Xilinx acquisition date. Additionally, the Company assumed $203 million of long-term liabilities for uncertain tax positions, including $12 million of interest, as well as $321 million of long-term liabilities for transition tax payable over three years. Included in the assumed liabilities for uncertain tax positions is a tax position with respect to whether stock-based compensation from Xilinx’s cost sharing arrangement should be shared among cost share participants. The Company has concluded that the law was unsettled and believes the current uncertain tax position liability is sufficient and will continue to monitor developments in relevant tax court cases. 84 Table of Contents A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 275 $ 119 $ 65 Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 748 156 30 Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 104 14 41 Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years ( 12 ) ( 9 ) ( 15 ) Increases to tax positions taken in prior years through acquisitions 252 — — Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities and statute of limitation lapses ( 6 ) ( 5 ) ( 2 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,361 $ 275 $ 119 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate if recognized was $ 1.2 billion, $ 215 million and $ 77 million as of December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities within the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company had $81.3 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 including $12 million assumed from the Xilinx acquisition. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the Company had long-term income tax liabilities of $1.3 billion and $189 million, respectively, recorded under Other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, where tax years from 2008 are open for audit. Pre-acquisition Xilinx U.S. tax returns for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 are currently under audit by the IRS. It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. NOTE 15 – Other Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes the components of Other income (expense), net: Year Ended December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Interest income $ 65 $ 8 $ 8 Loss on debt redemption, repurchase and conversion — ( 7 ) ( 54 ) Gains (losses) on equity investments, net ( 62 ) 56 2 Other income (expense) 5 ( 2 ) ( 3 ) Other income (expense), net $ 8 $ 55 $ ( 47 ) NOTE 16 – Commitments and Guarantees Operating Leases The Company has entered into operating and finance leases for its corporate offices, data centers, research and development facilities and certain equipment. The leases expire at various dates through 2031, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to ten years. 85 Table of Contents For 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 118 million, $ 71 million and $ 59 million, respectively, of operating lease expense, including short-term lease expense. For 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 40 million and $ 26 million, respectively, of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For 2022 and 2021, cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $ 108 million and $ 67 million, respectively. The Company’s finance and short-term leases are immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Supplemental information related to leases is as follows: December 31, 2022 Weighted-average remaining lease term in years – operating leases 5.98 Weighted-average discount rate – operating leases 3.83 % Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: Year (In millions) 2023 $ 109 2024 99 2025 88 2026 77 2027 59 2028 and thereafter 113 Total minimum lease payments 545 Less: interest ( 56 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 489 Less: current portion ( 93 ) Total long-term operating lease liabilities $ 396 Certain other operating leases contain provisions for escalating lease payments subject to changes in the consumer price index. Commitments The Company’s purchase commitments primarily include the Company’s obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. Purchase commitments include obligations made under noncancellable purchase orders and contractual obligations requiring minimum purchases or for which cancellation would lead to significant penalties. Total future unconditional purchase commitments as of December 31, 2022 were as follows: Year (In millions) 2023 $ 6,489 2024 1,434 2025 271 2026 129 2027 85 2028 and thereafter 202 Total unconditional purchase commitments $ 8,610 On an ongoing basis, the Company works with suppliers on the timing of payments and deliveries of purchase commitments, taking into account business conditions. 86 Table of Contents Warranties and Indemnities The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year . The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during 2022 and 2021 are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 25, 2021 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 51 $ 37 Provisions during the period 115 106 Settlements during the period ( 101 ) ( 92 ) Ending balance $ 65 $ 51 In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial. NOTE 17 – Contingencies Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On May 14, 2020, at the request of Polaris, the Court dismissed all claims related to one of the two patents in suite in the Polaris case. On June 10, 2020, the Court granted AMD’s motions to stay the Polaris and Aquila cases pending the completion of inter partes review of each of the patents-in-suit in those cases by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. On February 22, 2021, February 26, 2021, and March 10, 2021, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued final written decisions in inter partes reviews invalidating all asserted claims of the remaining Polaris and Aquila patents. On May 10, 2021, Aquila filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the IPR decision regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,895,519.

The agreement did not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. 88 Table of Contents Environmental Matters The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $ 3.9 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 89 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for the United States Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) tax to recognize deferred taxes for temporary tax basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI tax in future years. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 90 Table of Contents Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Inventory Valuation Description of the Matter At December 31, 2022, the Company’s net inventory balance was $3,771 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand and by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described assumptions and management’s judgments. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments. 91 Table of Contents Business Combination Description of the Matter During fiscal year 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (“Xilinx”) for consideration of $48.8 billion, as disclosed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Xilinx was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in the Company’s determination of the fair value of certain identified intangible assets, principally consisting of developed technology and customer relationships. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of these intangible assets included certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results, specifically, revenue growth rates, technology migration curves, and time to recreate customer relationships. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for the acquisition. This included testing controls over the estimation process supporting the recognition and measurement of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, including the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. To test the estimated fair value of the developed technology and customer relationships intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends and to the Company's budgets and forecasts, and Xilinx’s historical operating results. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. Our valuation specialists’ procedures included, among others, developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rates used in the valuation models and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970. San Jose, California February 27, 2023 92 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 93 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California February 27, 2023 94 Table of Contents ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 31, 2022, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 95 Table of Contents Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating the Xilinx and Pensando operations, control processes and information systems into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting during this integration. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION The U.S. government has designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the FSB) as a blocked party under Executive Order 13382. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued General License No. 1B (the OFAC General License), which generally authorizes certain licensing, permitting, certification, notification, and related transactions with the FSB as may be required for the importation, distribution, or use of information technology products in the Russian Federation. As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, Xilinx, which we acquired on February 14, 2022, previously authorized prior to such acquisition certain third-party resellers in Russia to periodically file notifications with, or apply for import licenses and permits from, the FSB on its behalf in connection with the importation of its products into the Russian Federation, as permitted under the OFAC General License. Subsequent to February 14, 2022, but during the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, third-party resellers filed additional notifications with and/or applied for import licenses and permits from the FSB on behalf of Xilinx. During the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2022, we and our subsidiaries, including Xilinx, suspended shipments to the Russian Federation. There was no gross revenue or net profits of ours or any of our subsidiaries directly associated with these filing activities. We and our subsidiaries do not sell products or provide services to the FSB. ITEM 9C.

BUSINESS Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements The statements in this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology including “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “plans,” “pro forma,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or the negative of these words and phrases, other variations of these words and phrases or comparable terminology. The forward-looking statements relate to, among other things: possible impact of future accounting rules on AMD’s consolidated financial statements; demand for AMD’s products; the growth, change and competitive landscape of the markets in which AMD participates; international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future; that AMD’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances, together with the availability under that certain revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) made available to AMD and certain of its subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement, and our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund AMD’s operations including capital expenditures and purchase commitments over the next 12 months; AMD’s ability to obtain sufficient external financing on favorable terms, or at all; AMD’s expectation that based on the information presently known to management, the potential liability related to AMD’s current litigation will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations; anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls; all unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months; revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied which will be recognized over the next 12 months; a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of AMD’s revenue in the future; and the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. For a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, see “Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors” and the “Financial Condition” section set forth in “Part II, Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” or MD&A, and such other risks and uncertainties as set forth below in this report or detailed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reports and filings.

(Xilinx), whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx (the Merger), with Xilinx surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of common stock of Xilinx (Xilinx Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx Common Stock held directly by us or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-assessable shares of our common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any applicable withholding. As of the signing of the Merger Agreement, the transaction was valued at $35 billion. The actual valuation of the transaction could differ significantly from the estimated amount due to movements in the price of our common stock, the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and other factors. The closing of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval. On April 7, 2021, our stockholders voted to approve all the proposals relating to the Merger at a special meeting of stockholders. Xilinx stockholders also voted to approve their respective proposals relating to the Merger at a Xilinx special meeting held on the same day. The Merger is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. Our Industry We are a global semiconductor company. Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function. Our Strategy AMD is focused on high performance computing technology, software and product leadership. Our strategy is to create and deliver the world’s leading high-performance CPUs and GPUs, and to integrate these CPUs and GPUs with hardware and software to build differentiated solutions. We invest in high-performance CPUs for client systems, as well as for high performance computing solutions, cloud infrastructure and the private and public cloud environment. We also invest in high-performance GPUs and software for markets such as gaming, compute, artificial intelligence, cloud gaming, and virtual and augmented reality. We combine our high-performance CPUs and GPUs to deliver solutions that are differentiated at the chip level, such as our semi-custom SoCs and APUs, and at the solution level, such as PC and server platforms. Computing and Graphics Markets Our Computing and Graphics products address the need for computational and visual data processing in computing devices that include personal computers, laptops / notebooks, and workstations. In the PC market, we design CPUs, APUs and GPUs for consumer and commercial desktops, notebooks and workstations. Our CPUs and APUs are designed to bring performance, efficiency and modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and commercial enterprises. Our GPUs address the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices. Many consumers use PCs as entertainment platforms, in addition to traditional productivity and communications uses, and therefore value a richer, more visually compelling and immersive experience. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to the increased creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for playing games, capturing media, viewing online videos, editing photos and managing digital content on computing devices. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Our CPUs and APUs bring performance, efficiency and modern security features to gamers, creators, consumers and enterprises. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD), that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market. 3 In addition to traditional graphics markets, there is a large and growing demand for accelerated computing, powered by graphics processors in markets such as high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, and Cloud Visualization (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure & Cloud Gaming). Another area of the market for graphics compute is blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store, transmit and process sensitive and valuable data. Blockchain applications are typically performed using specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general-purpose CPU or GPU. Our Computing Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and a chipset when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Infinity Fabric™, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable fast data access and high-performance. We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state. We also continually strive to improve security features in our products to help our customers protect their sensitive information. To that end, we offer integrated on-chip security features and other security features our customers can choose to enable. Desktop Microprocessors .

Two customers, A and B, accounted for 14% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 25, 2021. Sales to Customer A consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, and sales to Customer B consisted of products from our Computing and Graphics segment. A loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and some local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners’ business; however, we are increasingly focused on the Value Added Reseller (VAR) channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Additionally, we have increased our focus on global system integrators, which resell OEM systems, coupled with their software and services solutions into Enterprise, HPC and Cloud Service Provider Customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles. Third-Party Distributors Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, and may include those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. 8 Competition in the Computing and Graphics Segment The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our primary competitor in the supply of microprocessors is Intel Corporation (Intel). A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the PC market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In 2020, NVIDIA Corporation (NVIDIA), our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market, announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. In the graphics market, our principal competitor in the supply of discrete graphics is NVIDIA who is the market share leader. Intel also manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Also, Intel has developed their own high-end discrete GPUs and has announced that they have developed gaming-focused discrete graphics that will release in 2022. Other competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Some of our competitors are smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so. We believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent a high and growing barrier to entry in this market. With respect to integrated graphics, higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. For GPU data center products, our principal competitor is NVIDIA, which established its market share in HPC and machine learning through its CUDA software platform. Another competitor, Intel, builds products for acceleration in the data center, such as Intel Xe or Habana AI processors. Other competitors include numerous deep learning accelerator companies, consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups. Large cloud service providers have also shown interest in building their own products to accelerate AI. Competition in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Segment In the server market, we compete against Intel with our CPU server products and NVIDIA with our GPU server products. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs are being used in the server market, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In 2020, NVIDIA announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, and where we compete primarily against NVIDIA. Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. In September 2021, we announced our goal to deliver a 30x increase in energy efficiency of EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPU accelerators by 2025. Another important area of focus is on HPC, which has traditionally focused on scientific computing and supercomputers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We are also focusing on ways to increase cores and modularity in design through our implementation of chiplet technology, where the typical monolithic chip is broken into different smaller units called a chiplet. We are also working on innovations in packaging technology for chiplets, such as 2D and 3D packaging. For example, in November 2021 we announced our 3D V-Cache packaging technology which stacks dies three dimensionally for improved performance. We also work on advanced memory technologies. As SoC technology advances, the memory can sometimes limit CPU performance and we work on improving memory technology to improve performance. AMD worked with the JEDEC standard bodies and participating companies to establish a new industry memory standard, high bandwidth memory (HBM). HBM is a type of memory chip with lower power consumption and ultra-wide communication lanes to improve performance 9 and energy efficiency. HBM memory chips are vertically stacked, like floors in a skyscraper to shorten the distance of the information being communicated. Another area of focus is machine intelligence which is the platform for the growing field of machine learning. Our CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and APUs offer the computation capability and flexibility required for various machine learning deployments. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams, located in Canada, China, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters. Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities We have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for our products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes. We are also a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), with respect to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes. Other Third-Party Manufacturers We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers. Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities Wafers for our products under the Computing and Graphics and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs. Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 4,000 patents in the United States and approximately 1,600 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,000 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 6,800 issued patents and 3,300 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend . Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products, our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter. Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact 10 these trends. Human Capital As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately 15,500 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following: Mission, Culture, and Engagement Our History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global company achieving many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop high-performance computing and visualization products to solve some of the world’s toughest and most interesting challenges. Our Vision - High performance computing is transforming our lives. Our Mission - Build great products that accelerate next-generation computing experiences. Our employees are driven by this vision and mission. Innovation occurs when creative minds and diverse perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of our unique culture and the reason why AMD employees are among the most engaged in our industry. We conduct a confidential annual survey of our global workforce to measure our culture, engagement, and manager quality. The results are reviewed by the AMD Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership team and individual managers at every level. Results from our 2021 survey reported scores that continued to be among the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees described our culture as inclusive, innovative, open, and respectful, and rated the quality of our managers among the top 10% of our technology industry peers. Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion Our diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes AMD stronger. Our Employee Resource Groups encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our culture. In 2021, we were recognized for the fifth consecutive year by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation as a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ equality and were included in Bloomberg’s Gender Equality Index for the third consecutive year. We are focused on hiring and developing underrepresented groups and women leaders. We are proud to be led by a highly regarded CEO who has won many esteemed awards for her business and leadership prowess. In 2021, Dr. Lisa Su received the “Woman Innovation Award” from the Global Semiconductor Alliance and she was listed among Barron’s World’s Best CEOs and Forbes’ World’s Most Powerful Women for her strategic vision and successful company turn around. In addition, Dr. Su was appointed by President Biden to the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Total Rewards We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the industry’s best and brightest. Our rewards are guided by employees’ preferences and the market for talent. Based on this, we grew headcount by over 20% in 2021 to support the substantial growth in the business. We have a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives superior results. Our employees have benefited from our robust financial results with very strong short-term and long-term incentives. Cash bonuses have exceeded target levels. Stock awards, which drive an ownership mentality among employees, create considerable income for our employees. Development We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at AMD. We are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employees to take advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly rated and we provide specialized development programs for our employees. Environmental Regulations 11 Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. 12 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

For a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below. 14 Economic and Strategic Risks Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field. Intel Corporation (Intel) has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as NVIDIA Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information or restricting access to external companies. Also, Intel has developed their own high-end discrete GPUs and has announced that they have developed gaming-focused discrete graphics that will be released in 2022. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment or other unfavorable changes in economic conditions, such as inflation, interest rates or recession, may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. 15 The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures, including vaccination and testing requirements and recordkeeping, quarantines, business closures, travel bans, and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility, to contain the virus. Various state and federal rules are issued and updated on an ongoing basis, at times in conflict and/or with minimal notice. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. While many of our offices around the world remain open, either because the pandemic has been contained in that location or to enable critical on-site business functions in compliance with government guidelines, we continue to have many of our employees work from home until further notice. It is uncertain as to when the measures put in place to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be lifted or whether there will be additional measures put into place. If COVID-19 continues to spread or if there are further waves of the virus, we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner that may impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation, quarantine, unavailability of COVID-19 tests, travel restrictions or illness, a reluctance or refusal to vaccinate, or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of time, we may not be able to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Although some public health measures have eased and a small portion of our employees are at work in certain offices, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our employees to health risks. Even when COVID-19 measures regarding mobility are lifted or modified, our employees’ ability to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operations. COVID-19 continues to impact the global supply chain causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 and we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We have taken efforts to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our suppliers. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates at a reasonable cost, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. If the supply of our products to customers is delayed, reduced or canceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturers, back-end manufacturers, warehouses, partners, suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures, border and port restrictions or closures, transportation delays, labor shortages or workforce mobility limitations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy, creating uncertainty and potentially leading to an economic downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases, or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amounts due to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. Even in times of robust demand for our products, as we are currently experiencing across our business, the worldwide economic environment remains uncertain due to COVID-19 and such demand may not be sustainable over the longer term. COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our Revolving Credit Facility and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond, to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operations and capital expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contracting capital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19, it may have an adverse effect on our business. 16 The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are unpredictable and highly uncertain, including the continued spread, duration and severity of the outbreak, the appearances of new variants of COVID-19, the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective treatments and vaccines, and public health measures and actions taken throughout the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is seeking to expand its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. We also face competition from companies that use competing computing architectures and platforms like the ARM architecture. Increased adoption of ARM-based semiconductor designs could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry. 17 The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have in the past experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation®5, Microsoft® Xbox™ Series S and Microsoft® Xbox™ Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, South Korea has instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies and China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. 18 If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated, expire, or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Also, due to measures to slow down the spread of COVID-19, various patent offices and courts have been adversely impacted and there is a potential for delay or disruptions that might affect certain of our patent rights. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Operational and Technology Risks We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We utilize third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We rely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of all wafers for products at 7 nanometer (nm) or smaller nodes, and we rely primarily on GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) for wafers for products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7 nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 19 We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice, require prepayments, or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules, quality assurance and price increases, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, and this agreement is in place through 2025. In May 2021, we entered into an amendment to the WSA, and in December 2021, we further amended these terms (the “Amendment”). Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and AMD has corresponding annual wafer purchase targets. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. AMD and GF also have agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and AMD is obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment no longer includes any exclusivity commitments and provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. If GF fails to meet its minimum annual capacity allocation obligations, we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our busines s. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. 20 If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of equipment, materials or substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in equipment, materials or substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements with some of our vendors. If the delivery of such supply is delayed or does not occur for any reason, it could materially impact our ability to procure and process the required volume of supply to meet customer demand. Conversely, a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have prepayment arrangements with certain vendors. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm and lower product portfolio on TSMC’s processes. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our products at 7nm or smaller nodes in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. 21 The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis, are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next-generation AMD Ryzen™, AMD Radeon™ and AMD EPYC™ processors. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers’ products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customers’ products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. 22 Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. The products that we sell are complex and have been and may in the future be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may depend on vendors to create mitigations to their technology that we incorporate into our products and they may delay or decline to make such mitigations. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers and end users, to deploy our mitigations alone or as part of their own mitigations, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We have and may in the future be subject to claims and litigation related to security vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. The White House, SEC and other regulators have also increased their focus on companies’ cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. We believe that companies like AMD have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, business and system disruption attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. The increased prevalence of work-from-home arrangements at AMD and our providers has presented additional operational and cybersecurity risks to our IT systems as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party partners. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber threats may come into our network through malicious code that is added to widely available open-source software. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, have been and may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. It also may not be possible to determine the root cause of such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to: enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; investigating, responding to and remediating any data security breach, and addressing any related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and complying with external regulations. 23 We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. 24 We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our AIB partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. 25 These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 26 We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. Legal and Regulatory Risks Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019, the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. 27 Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, including as a result of tax regulation changes. We are subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions, as described in Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements. For example, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. 28 We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our former facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Customers are increasingly seeking information about the source of minerals used in our supply chain beyond those addressed in laws and regulations. Given the complexity of mineral supply chains, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. 29 Customers, governments and authorities are increasingly focused on the risk of forced labor in supply chains that may increase the cost of our compliance program. Germany’s federal procurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, issued new supply chain labor requirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have previously issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a Human Rights Policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product. Xilinx Merger and Acquisition Risks Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments, including our previously announced acquisition of Xilinx, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. For example, on October 26, 2020, we, along with a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), whereby we agreed to acquire Xilinx (the Merger). We entered into the Merger Agreement with the belief that the Merger will result in certain benefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations. Achieving these anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and Xilinx’s businesses together. It is not certain that Xilinx’s business can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: failure to obtain applicable regulatory approval in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the Merger; our inability to integrate or benefit from Xilinx’s acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the Merger; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the Merger on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of, Xilinx’s employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and Xilinx operate; potential litigation associated with the Merger; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with integrating and upgrading our and Xilinx’s financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and negatively impact the combined company. If we cannot successfully integrate our and Xilinx’s businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 30 Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition (and as contemplated in the Merger), we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example, we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. Our ability to complete the Xilinx Merger is subject to closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Xilinx Merger not to be completed. The Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions as specified in the Merger Agreement. These include, among others, the receipt of approvals under certain competition laws and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the Merger. No assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Also, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us, our directors, Xilinx or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and the plaintiffs in such proceedings secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting our and/or Xilinx’s ability to complete the Merger on the terms contemplated by the Merger Agreement, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective in a timely manner, or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve. We cannot provide any assurances that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the Merger. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, Xilinx will be required to pay a termination fee to us equal to $1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because Xilinx’s board of directors has changed its recommendation. We will be required to pay a termination fee to Xilinx equal to $1.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because our board of directors has changed its recommendation. We will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals by October 26, 2021 (subject to automatic extension first to January 26, 2022 and then to April 26, 2022, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditions remain outstanding). 31 Whether or not it is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Xilinx Merger could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results . Whether or not it is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business: our and Xilinx’s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the ability to retain key employees; uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger may cause customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or others to delay or defer entering into contracts, make other decisions or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships; and the attention of management may be directed toward the completion of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the potential payment of termination fees and the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. Any impairment of the combined company’s tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact the combined company’s financial position and results of operations. The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the Merger. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Merger, the combined company is expected to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheet. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, the combined company determines that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, the combined company would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of the combined company’s business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, which may have a material adverse impact on the combined company’s financial position and results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Risks The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.50% Senior Notes due August 2022 (7.50% Notes) contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries, and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility’s credit agreement (Credit Agreement) restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that (i) on the date of such payment, an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or would result therefrom or (ii) if we would have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, a consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds 3.50x. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If under certain circumstances we fail to make a cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, could constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. Our Revolving Credit Facility also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities, make certain dispositions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). 32 The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $100 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.50% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 25, 2021 was $313 million. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements. Also, if we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our working capital requirements will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. In addition, our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. Our inability to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. General Risks Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, Latin America and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 72% for the year ended December 25, 2021. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. 33 The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; inflation; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with United States laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters and climate change such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, droughts, fires, extreme heat and volcanic eruptions that disrupt our operations, or those of our manufacturers, vendors or customers. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. Also, we have operations and employees in regions that have experienced prolonged heat waves and freezing in Texas and wildfires in California. Extreme weather events can also disrupt the ability of our suppliers to deliver expected manufacturing parts and/or services for periods of time. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. In addition, many governments have enacted laws around personally identifiable information, such as the European Union’s general Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the failure to comply could result in sanctions or other actions by the governments. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. 34 Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, inflation, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. In May 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. This repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Our stock repurchases could affect the trading price of our stock, the volatility of our stock price, reduce our cash reserves, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 25, 2021, we leased approximately 2.7 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use throughout the world. Our headquarters is located in Santa Clara, California, and we have significant operations in Austin, Texas; Shanghai, China; Markham, Ontario, Canada; and Bangalore and Hyderabad, India. We also have a number of regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity. 35 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS For a discussion of our legal proceedings, refer to Note 17 – Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. 36 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “AMD”. On January 28, 2022, there were 4,492 registered holders of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $105.24 per share as reported on NASDAQ. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities In May 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. We expect to fund repurchases through cash generated from operations which have been strengthened by our strong operational results. Our stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

On December 27, 2021, we issued warrants to purchase 63,226 shares of our common stock to a commercial partner pursuant to a strategic arrangement executed in 2018 with such partner. The warrants have an exercise price of $25.4994 per share and expire on December 27, 2024. The warrants were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] 38 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2021 compared to 2020, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2020. Overview Our leadership portfolio of high-performance products, robust customer demand, and consistent execution helped drive strong financial results in 2021. Net revenue for 2021 was $16.4 billion, an increase of 68% compared to 2020 net revenue of $9.8 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2021, was 48%, compared to 45% in 2020. Our operating income for 2021 improved to $3.6 billion compared to operating income of $1.4 billion for 2020. Our net income for 2021 improved to $3.2 billion compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 25, 2021 were $3.6 billion, compared to $2.3 billion at the end of 2020. The aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 25, 2021 was $313 million, compared to $338 million as of December 26, 2020. We introduced a number of high-performance products in 2021. We expanded the AMD Ryzen mobile processor family with the launch of the AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors with “Zen 3” core architecture designed for gamers, creators and professionals. We also announced the AMD Ryzen PRO 5000 Series Mobile Processors powered with our “Zen 3” core architecture for business laptops. AMD Ryzen PRO Series Mobile Processors are built to provide powerful computing experiences with security features for demanding business environments like remote working. We also launched a number of graphics products during 2021, including the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card built on 7 nm process technology and AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture to deliver performance and power efficiency, as well as the AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT graphics card, designed to deliver high-frame rate, high-fidelity and highly responsive 1080p gaming experience. For mobile graphics, we introduced the AMD Radeon RX 6000M Series Mobile Graphics designed for high-performance gaming laptops and we announced the AMD Advantage™ Design Framework to deliver best-in-class gaming experiences. AMD Advantage systems combine AMD Radeon RX 6000M Series Mobile Graphics, AMD Radeon Software and AMD Ryzen 5000 Series Mobile Processors with AMD smart technologies. We also introduced the AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators based on the 2nd Gen AMD CDNA architecture, optimized for HPC and AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning) workloads. The MI200 series includes the MI250 Open Accelerator Module (OAM) form factor for purpose-built HPC/AI platforms and the MI210 PCIe form factor for mainstream server platforms. We also introduced our AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution software for game developers to help deliver a high-quality, high-resolution gaming experience. For professional graphics, we announced our AMD Radeon PRO W6000 series workstation graphics for professional users who have ultra-high resolution media projects, complex design and engineering simulations and advanced image and video editing applications. We also introduced the AMD Radeon PRO W6000X series graphics for the Mac Pro, designed to power a wide variety of demanding professional applications and workloads. For the server business, we introduced the next generation of AMD EPYC processors with the AMD EPYC 7003 Series CPUs for high-performance computing, cloud and enterprise customers. The EPYC 7003 series processors have up to 64 Zen 3 cores per processor and per-core cache memory and also include security features through AMD Infinity Guard to help drive faster times to results and improve business outcomes. Although the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2021. We are taking safety measures to protect our employees who are in 39 the office and support those employees who work from home. We are also monitoring our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic. COVID-19 also continues to impact the global supply chain, causing disruptions to service providers, logistics and the flow and availability of supplies and products. Despite these challenges, we took action to maintain a stable supply of materials to meet our production requirements and delivered incremental supply throughout the year. We also experienced strong customer demand in 2021 and made strategic investments through long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements in our supply chain to secure additional capacity to support future revenue growth. For example, we amended our Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) in May 2021 (the A&R Seventh Amendment) and in December 2021 (the Amendment) to modify certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm and 14 nm technology nodes from December 23, 2021 and continuing through December 31, 2025. Under the Amendment, GF will provide a minimum annual capacity allocation to us for years 2022 through 2025 and we have corresponding annual wafer targets. We also agreed to wafer pricing through 2025, and we are obligated to pre-pay GF certain amounts for those wafers in 2022 and 2023. The Amendment does not affect any of the prior exclusivity commitments that were removed under the A&R Seventh Amendment. We have full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured at any technology node. Due to our strong financial results and growing cash flow generation, in May 2021, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program (Repurchase Program) to purchase up to $4 billion of our outstanding common stock in the open market. During the twelve months ended December 25, 2021, we repurchased 16.7 million shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program, for a total cash outlay of $1.8 billion. As of December 25, 2021, $2.2 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As part of our strategy to establish AMD as the industry’s high performance computing leader, we announced in October 2020 that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction. The completion of the transaction remains subject to certain closing conditions, including regulatory approval, and is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers. We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both. 40 Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis. Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis. We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable. Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. We first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. 41 A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income Taxes . In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2021, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations, under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowances are maintained due to a lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. Results of Operations We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: Computing and Graphics, and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 14 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2021 and 2020: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 9,332 $ 6,432 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 7,102 3,331 Total net revenue $ 16,434 $ 9,763 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 2,090 $ 1,266 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 1,979 391 All Other (421) (288) Total operating income $ 3,648 $ 1,369 42 Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $9.3 billion in 2021 increased by 45%, compared to $6.4 billion in 2020, primarily as a result of a 57% increase in average selling price, partially offset by an 8% decrease in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of Ryzen, Radeon and AMD Instinct products. The lower unit shipments were primarily driven by a strategic focus on premium and higher end products in a tight supply environment. Computing and Graphics operating income was $2.1 billion in 2021 compared to $1.3 billion in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and improved margin in the segment which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $7.1 billion in 2021 increased by 113% compared to net revenue of $3.3 billion in 2020, primarily driven by higher sales of our semi-custom products and EPYC server processors. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to $391 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the higher revenue and improved margin in the segment which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other operating loss of $421 million in 2021 included stock-based compensation expense of $379 million and acquisition-related costs of $42 million. All Other operating loss of $288 million in 2020 included stock-based compensation expense of $274 million and acquisition-related costs of $14 million. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense) and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2021 and 2020: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions, except for percentages) Net revenue $ 16,434 $ 9,763 Cost of sales 8,505 5,416 Gross profit 7,929 4,347 Gross margin 48 % 45 % Research and development 2,845 1,983 Marketing, general and administrative 1,448 995 Licensing gain (12) — Interest expense (34) (47) Other income (expense), net 55 (47) Income tax provision (benefit) 513 (1,210) Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 48% in 2021 compared to 45% in 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a richer mix of EPYC, Radeon and Ryzen processor sales. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $2.8 billion in 2021 increased by $862 million, or 43%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in product development costs due to an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. 43 Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $1.4 billion in 2021 increased by $453 million, or 46%, compared to $995 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Licensing Gain During 2021, we recognized $12 million of royalty income associated with the licensed IP to the THATIC JV, our two joint ventures with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., a third-party Chinese entity. We did not recognize a licensing gain for the year ended December 26, 2020. Interest Expense Interest expense of $34 million in 2021 decreased by $13 million compared to $47 million in 2020, primarily due to lower debt balances as a result of conversions by holders of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026. Other Income (Expense), net Other income, net was $55 million for the year ended December 25, 2021 compared to $47 million of Other expense, net for the year ended December 26, 2020. The change was primarily due to a net gain of $56 million from an increase in fair value of equity investments in 2021 and lower losses from the conversion of our convertible debt of $47 million in 2020. Income Taxes Provision (Benefit) We recorded an income tax provision of $513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14% and (95)% respectively. The income tax provision of $513 million was due to higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $147 million of foreign-derived intangible income tax benefit, $78 million of research and development tax credits, and $125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’ compensation. The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits. Through the end of fiscal year 2021, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 72% in 2021 and 77% in 2020. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 25, 2021, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $3.6 billion compared to $2.3 billion as of December 26, 2020. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 91% as of December 25, 2021, and 94% as of December 26, 2020. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. 44 Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for 2021 and 2020 were as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,521 $ 1,071 Investing activities (686) (952) Financing activities (1,895) 6 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 940 $ 125 Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $313 million and $338 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations along with our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures and purchase commitments, over the next 12 months and beyond. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. Operating Activities Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion in 2021, primarily due to our higher net income of $3.2 billion in 2021, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $1.1 billion and net cash outflows of $774 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $640 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.6 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, a $556 million increase in inventories driven by our continued increase in product build in support of customer demand, and a $920 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to prepayments under long-term supply agreements in 2021, offset by an $801 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, and a $526 million increase in accrued liabilities and other, both of which were driven mainly by higher marketing accruals, and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to our net income of $2.5 billion, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $488 million and net cash outflows of $931 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $219 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.1 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher collections due to better revenue linearity in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, a $417 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in product build in support of customer demand, a $231 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits, a $513 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, offset by a $574 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $686 million in 2021, which primarily consisted of higher cash used for purchases of short-term investments of $2.1 billion and $301 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by higher cash provided by maturities of short-term investments of $1.7 billion. Net cash used in investing activities was $952 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of $850 million for purchases of short-term investments and $294 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $192 million for maturities of short-term investments. 45 Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1.9 billion in 2021, which primarily consisted of common stock repurchases of $1.8 billion under the $4 billion stock repurchase program and higher repurchases to cover tax withholding on employee equity plans of $237 million, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $104 million. Net cash provided by financing activities was $6 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $85 million, partially offset by $78 million of common stock repurchased to cover employee withholding taxes on vesting of employee equity grants. We borrowed $200 million of short-term debt during the second quarter of 2020 and paid off the balance during the third quarter of 2020. Contractual Obligations For a description of our contractual obligations such as debt, leases, purchase and other contractual obligations, see Part II, Item 8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 6 - Debt and Revolving Credit Facility and Note 16 - Commitments and Guarantees. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 25, 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 46 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 25, 2021, our investment portfolio consisted of time deposits and commercial paper. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 25, 2021, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 25, 2021, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 18 months.

The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 ended on December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and assessing potential impairment, if any, of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation. Non-custom products The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Constraints of variable consideration have not been material. 54 Custom products Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements generally involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct, it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and IP arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Inventories The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required . Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. 55 The Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Contingencies From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities are included in short-term investments. Classification of marketable securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for credit loss. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for credit loss, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. 56 Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of equipment is two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases Operating and finance leases are recorded as right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the Company’s balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable. When the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on its collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the accounting policy to not recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $ 578 million , $ 314 million and $ 217 million, respectively. 57 Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Income Taxes. In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2019-12, I ncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which simplifies various aspects of accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2021 using the modified retrospective adoption method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period. The adoption of this new standard resulted in the recognition of an $8.4 million deferred tax liability associated with book-tax differences in foreign equity method investments. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

As of December 25, 2021, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one year was $ 197 million , of which $ 126 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less. Revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 23 % , 18 % and 19 % of the Company’s revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 59 NOTE 4 – Related Parties—Equity Joint Ventures ATMP Joint Venture s The Company holds a 15 % equity interest in two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd, a Chinese joint stock company. The Company has no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. The Company accounts for its equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to its significant influence over the ATMP JV. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to the Company. The Company assists the ATMP JV in its management of certain raw material inventory. The purchases from and resales to the ATMP JV of inventory under the Company’s inventory management program are reported within purchases and resales with the ATMP JV and do not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 5 – Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was $ 289 million, which was allocated to reporting units within the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. During the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to its reporting units. 60 NOTE 6 – Debt and Revolving Credit Facility Debt The Company’s total debt as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 consisted of: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) 7.50 % Senior Notes Due 2022 ( 7.50 % Notes) $ 312 $ 312 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) 1 26 Total debt (principal amount) 313 338 Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs — ( 8 ) Total debt (net) 313 330 Less: current portion of long-term debt ( 312 ) — Total long-term debt, net of current portion $ 1 $ 330 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, the Company issued $ 805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes). The 2.125 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017. During 2021, holders of the 2.125 % Notes converted $ 25 million principal amount of notes in exchange for approximately 3 million shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $ 8.00 per share. The Company recorded a loss of $ 7 million from these conversions in Other income (expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.125 % Notes was $ 1 million . The Company’s current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125 % Notes. As such, no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125 % Notes and the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125 % Notes as permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2021. The determination of whether or not the 2.125 % Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $ 146.14 on December 23, 2021, the last trading day of 2021, the if-converted value of the 2.125 % Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $ 15 million . The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes is 8 %. This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125 % Notes for the year ended December 25, 2021: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Contractual interest expense $ — $ 4 Interest cost related to amortization of the debt discount $ — $ 6 The carrying amount of the equity component of the 2.125 % Notes was $ 0 million and $ 10 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. 61 7.50 % Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012, the Company issued $ 500 million of its 7.50 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 7.50 % Notes). The 7.50 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50 % Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50 % Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 25, 2021, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50 % Notes was $ 312 million. Prior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50 % Notes at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50 % Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50 % Notes. Debt Covenants and Seniority The 7.50 % Notes require the Company to comply with certain financial covenants and a number of restrictive covenants. The 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes rank equally with the Company’s existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company’s future subordinated debt. The 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes rank junior to all of the Company’s future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes The Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so. Revolving Credit Facility The Company is party to a $ 500 million unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility), including a $ 50 million swingline sub-facility and a $ 75 million sublimit for letters of credit pursuant to a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in June 2024. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company’s option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. As of December 25, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had $ 14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Future Payments on Total Debt As of December 25, 2021, the Company’s future debt payment obligations were as follows: Term Debt (Principal only) Year (In millions) 2022 $ 312 2026 1 Total $ 313 62 NOTE 7 – Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements The Company’s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the measurement alternative, defined as cost, less impairments, adjusted for subsequent observable price changes and are periodically assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred. Fair Value Hierarchy The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. The guidance for fair value measurements requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3 — Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, as well as significant management judgment or estimation. Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Cash equivalents Money market funds $ 4 $ — $ 4 $ 1 $ — $ 1 Commercial paper — 45 45 — — — Short-term investments Commercial paper — 880 880 — 295 295 Time deposits — 193 193 — 400 400 Other non-current assets Equity investments 66 — 66 — — — Deferred compensation plan investments 72 — 72 46 — 46 Total assets measured at fair value $ 142 $ 1,118 $ 1,260 $ 47 $ 695 $ 742 The Company did not have any financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of December 25, 2021 or December 26, 2020. During the year ended December 25, 2021, the Company recognized a $ 64 million gain recorded in Other income in the consolidated statements of operations due to an increase in the fair value of an equity investment. Deferred compensation plan investments are mutual fund investments held in a Rabbi trust established to maintain the Company’s executive deferred compensation plan. 63 Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its long-term debt. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (In millions) Current portion of long-term debt, net $ 312 $ 326 $ — $ — Long-term debt, net of current portion 1 15 330 642 The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt are based on Level 2 inputs as the fair value is based on quoted prices for the Company’s debt and comparable instruments in inactive markets. The Company’s 2.125% Notes, included in Long-term debt, net, above, were convertible at the option of the holder as of December 25, 2021. The estimated fair value of the 2.125% Notes as of December 25, 2021 takes into account the value of the Company’s stock price of $ 146.14 as of December 23, 2021, the last trading date for the year ended December 25, 2021 and the initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock. The fair value of the Company’s time deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing terms. Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Accounting Hedges The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 18 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the notional values of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were $ 894 million and $ 501 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Accounting Hedges The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the notional values of outstanding contracts were $ 291 million and $ 254 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. NOTE 8 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income (loss). The table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges: (In millions) Beginning balance $ 17 $ — $ ( 8 ) Net unrealized gains (losses) arising during the period 5 18 2 Net losses (gains) reclassified into income during the period ( 25 ) ( 1 ) 6 Total other comprehensive income (loss) ( 20 ) 17 8 Ending balance $ ( 3 ) $ 17 $ — 64 NOTE 9 – Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities and trade receivables. The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in tax-exempt securities including municipal notes and bonds and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral. The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. The Company’s top three customers with the highest accounts receivable balances each accounted for approximately 20 %, 15 % and 9 % of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 25, 2021 and 18 %, 17 % and 6 %, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 26, 2020. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company. NOTE 10 – Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income for basic earnings per share $ 3,162 $ 2,490 $ 341 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Interest expense related to the 2.125% Notes — 1 — Net income for diluted earnings per share $ 3,162 $ 2,491 $ 341 Denominator Basic weighted-average shares 1,213 1,184 1,091 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity plans and warrants 16 20 29 2.125% Notes — 3 — Diluted weighted-average shares 1,229 1,207 1,120 Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.61 $ 2.10 $ 0.31 Diluted $ 2.57 $ 2.06 $ 0.30 Potential shares from employee equity plans and the impact from the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes up to the conversion date, totaling 2 million and 22 million shares for 2021 and 2020, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 65 NOTE 11 – Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Common Stock Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: Year Ended December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Balance, beginning of period 1,211 1,170 1,005 Common stock issued under employee equity plans 12 14 20 Repurchases of common stock ( 17 ) — — Common stock repurchases for tax withholding on equity awards ( 2 ) ( 1 ) — Issuance of common stock upon warrant exercise — — 75 Issuance of common stock to settle convertible debt 3 28 69 Issuance of treasury stock to partially settle debt — — 1 Balance, end of period 1,207 1,211 1,170 Stock Repurchase Program In May 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing up to $4 billion of repurchases of the Company’s outstanding common stock (the Repurchase Program). During the year ended December 25, 2021, the Company repurchased 16.7 million shares of its common stock under the Repurchase Program for $ 1.8 billion. As of December 25, 2021, $ 2.2 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. This Repurchase Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 ESPP, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan). Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs. Stock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0 % to 250 % of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award. 66 ESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 15 % of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year. As of December 25, 2021, the Company had 50 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 17 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan. In addition, the Company had 39 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the 2017 plan. Valuation and Expense Stock-based compensation expense was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 5 $ 6 $ 6 Research and development 246 173 129 Marketing, general, and administrative 128 95 62 Total stock-based compensation expense before income taxes 379 274 197 Income tax benefit ( 58 ) ( 42 ) — Total stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 321 $ 232 $ 197 Stock Options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 46.07 , $ 38.49 and $ 13.31 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Expected volatility 51.77 % 57.87 % 52.60 % - 56.51 % Risk-free interest rate 0.69 % 0.18 % 1.53 % - 2.51 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected life (in years) 4.55 4.30 3.94 - 3.95 The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The following table summarizes stock option activity and related information: Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions, except share price) Balance as of December 26, 2020 7 $ 12.91 Granted 1 $ 107.58 Exercised ( 3 ) $ 4.38 Balance as of December 25, 2021 5 $ 23.98 $ 614 2.80 Exercisable December 25, 2021 4 $ 13.24 $ 561 2.23 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 277 million, $ 180 million and $ 84 million, respectively.

The Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were approximately $ 35 million , $ 29 million and $ 25 million, respectively. 69 NOTE 13 – Income Taxes Income before income taxes consists of the following: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) U.S. $ 3,528 $ 1,213 $ 334 Non-U.S. 147 67 38 Total pre-tax income including equity income (loss) in investee $ 3,675 $ 1,280 $ 372 The income tax provision (benefit) consists of: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Current: U.S. Federal $ 112 $ — $ ( 13 ) U.S. State and Local 11 5 1 Non-U.S. 82 8 50 Total 205 13 38 Deferred: U.S. Federal 320 ( 1,193 ) — U.S. State and Local ( 7 ) ( 28 ) — Non-U.S. ( 5 ) ( 2 ) ( 7 ) Total 308 ( 1,223 ) ( 7 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ 513 $ ( 1,210 ) $ 31 The table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total income tax provision (benefit). December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Statutory federal income tax expense at 21% $ 772 $ 269 $ 78 State taxes (benefit) 1 ( 6 ) 1 Foreign withholding taxes 7 10 22 Foreign rate detriment / (benefit) 71 ( 3 ) 2 Valuation allowance change 3 ( 1,301 ) ( 59 ) Research credits ( 78 ) ( 57 ) — Excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation ( 125 ) ( 116 ) — Tax Reform Act — — ( 13 ) Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction ( 147 ) — — Other 9 ( 6 ) — Income tax provision (benefit) $ 513 $ ( 1,210 ) $ 31 The Company recorded an income tax provision of $ 513 million in 2021 and an income tax benefit of $ 1.2 billion in 2020, representing effective tax rates of 14 % and ( 95 )% respectively. The income tax provision of $ 513 million was a result of higher income in the U.S. and increase in foreign taxes, partially offset by $ 147 million of foreign-derived intangible income benefit, $ 78 million of research and development tax credits, and $ 125 million of excess tax benefit for stock-based compensation net of non-deductible officers’ compensation. 70 The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $ 1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $ 10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $ 13 million of state and foreign taxes and $ 75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above. The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $ 22 million of withholding tax related to cross-border transactions and $ 22 million of tax in foreign locations, partially offset by a $ 13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryovers $ 920 $ 1,029 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 631 514 Employee benefits not currently deductible 164 122 Federal and state tax credit carryovers 319 569 Foreign research and development ITC credits 547 489 Capitalized costs 121 174 Lease liability 124 72 Other 27 29 Total deferred tax assets 2,853 2,998 Less: valuation allowance ( 1,735 ) ( 1,576 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,118 1,422 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquired intangibles and goodwill ( 50 ) ( 1 ) Right-of-use assets ( 110 ) ( 62 ) Discount of convertible notes — ( 2 ) Undistributed foreign earnings ( 24 ) ( 114 ) Other ( 15 ) ( 9 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 199 ) ( 188 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 919 $ 1,234 The movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 1,576 $ 2,867 $ 2,443 Charges (reductions) to income tax expense/other accounts* 3 ( 1,301 ) ( 61 ) Net (deductions) recoveries + 156 10 485 Balance at end of year $ 1,735 $ 1,576 $ 2,867 * Amounts recorded against other accounts are not material + The 2019 and 2021 net recoveries were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits 71 Deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The breakdown between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 is as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Deferred tax assets $ 931 $ 1,245 Deferred tax liabilities ( 12 ) ( 11 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 919 $ 1,234 Through the end of fiscal year 2021, the Company continued to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $ 1.7 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. Certain state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of future taxable income. The Company’s United States federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 25, 2021, were $ 1.9 billion and $ 265 million, respectively. Net operating losses may be subject to limitations by the Internal Revenue Code and similar provisions. The United States federal net operating losses will expire between 2034 and 2037, and the state net operating losses will expire at various dates through 2039. The federal tax credits of $ 441.8 million will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2041. The state tax credits of $ 288 million will expire at various dates between 2022 through 2036 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $ 552 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040. Under current U.S. tax law the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $ 364 million as of December 25, 2021. A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 119 $ 65 $ 49 Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 14 41 5 Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years ( 9 ) ( 15 ) — Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 156 30 15 Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities ( 5 ) ( 1 ) ( 3 ) Decreases for lapsing of the statute of limitations — ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance at end of year $ 275 $ 119 $ 65 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $ 215 million, $ 77 million and $ 17 million as of December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. The Company had $39 million of accrued penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 25, 2021. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has provided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, which is open for years from 2008 onwards due to the net operating losses. 72 NOTE 14 – Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. The Company has the following two reportable segments: • the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook microprocessors, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and graphics, chipsets, discrete graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs, and development services. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. • the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom SoC products, development services and technology for game consoles. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes employee stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related costs. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019. December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 9,332 $ 6,432 $ 4,709 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 7,102 3,331 2,022 Total net revenue $ 16,434 $ 9,763 $ 6,731 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 2,090 $ 1,266 $ 577 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 1,979 391 263 All Other ( 421 ) ( 288 ) ( 209 ) Total operating income $ 3,648 $ 1,369 $ 631 The following table provides items included in All Other category: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Operating loss: Stock-based compensation expense $ ( 379 ) $ ( 274 ) $ ( 197 ) Acquisition-related costs ( 42 ) ( 14 ) — Loss contingency on legal matter — — ( 12 ) Total operating loss $ ( 421 ) $ ( 288 ) $ ( 209 ) The Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. 73 The following table summarizes sales to external customers by geographic regions based on billing location of the customer: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) United States $ 4,656 $ 2,294 $ 1,764 China (including Hong Kong) 4,096 2,329 1,736 Japan 2,381 1,033 840 Europe 1,249 1,108 762 Taiwan 2,091 1,187 719 Singapore 1,389 1,096 597 Other countries 572 716 313 Total sales to external customers $ 16,434 $ 9,763 $ 6,731 The following table summarizes sales to major customers that accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenue for the respective years: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Customer A 14 % * 12 % Customer B 11 % * * * Less than 10% Sales to customer A consisted of products primarily from the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment and sales to customer B consisted of products primarily from the Computing and Graphics segment.

The leases expire at various dates through 2031, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to ten years. For 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 71 million , $ 59 million and $ 56 million, respectively, of operating lease expense, including short-term lease expense. For 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 26 million and $ 27 million, respectively, of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For 2021 and 2020, cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $ 67 million and $ 55 million, respectively. The Company’s finance and short-term leases are immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Supplemental information related to leases is as follows: December 25, 2021 Weighted-average remaining lease term in years – operating leases 6.10 Weighted-average discount rate – operating leases 3.70 % Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease liabilities as of December 25, 2021 are as follows: Year (In millions) 2022 $ 89 2023 85 2024 78 2025 68 2026 59 2027 and thereafter 92 Total minimum lease payments 471 Less: interest ( 52 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 419 Less: current portion ( 71 ) Total long-term operating lease liabilities $ 348 Certain other operating leases contain provisions for escalating lease payments subject to changes in the consumer price index. Commitments The Company’s purchase commitments primarily include the Company’s obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties and future payments related to certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses. 75 Total future unconditional purchase commitments as of December 25, 2021 were as follows: Year (In millions) 2022 $ 5,765 2023 1,658 2024 755 2025 329 2026 176 2027 and thereafter 383 Total unconditional purchase commitments $ 9,066 Warranties and Indemnities The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year . The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during the years ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are as follows: December 25, 2021 December 26, 2020 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 37 $ 15 Provisions during the period 106 82 Settlements during the period ( 92 ) ( 60 ) Ending balance $ 51 $ 37 In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial. NOTE 17 – Contingencies Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al., Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32 nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company’s common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al., Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 76 On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on the Company’s 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al., C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against the Company and certain of its officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding its 32 nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of the Company’s insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On July 23, 2018, the Santa Clara Superior Court sustained the Company’s demurrer in the Wessels case, dismissing all claims in that matter with prejudice. The California Court of Appeal affirmed this decision on August 27, 2020 and issued its remittitur on September 9, 2020, which foreclosed further appeals in the state court litigation. On October 4, 2018, the district court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints and both plaintiffs appealed. On March 16, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the Ha complaint and the time to seek further appeals has since expired. On the same day, the Ninth Circuit also reversed and remanded the district court’s dismissal of the Hamilton complaint for further consideration of defendants’ motion to dismiss. Following supplemental briefing, the district court entered an order on April 5, 2021 dismissing with prejudice all claims in the Hamilton action as precluded by the decision in the Wessels case. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On May 14, 2020, at the request of Polaris, the Court dismissed all claims related to one of the two patents in suite in the Polaris case. On June 10, 2020, the Court granted AMD’s motions to stay the Polaris and Aquila cases pending the completion of inter partes review of each of the patents-in-suit in those cases by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. On February 22, 2021, February 26, 2021, and March 10, 2021, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued final written decisions in inter partes reviews invalidating all asserted claims of the remaining Polaris and Aquila patents. On May 10, 2021, Aquila filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the IPR decision regarding U.S. Patent No. 6,895,519. On April 30, 2021, Polaris filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the IPR decision regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,117,526. On May 14, 2021, AMD filed a notice of cross-appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for the IPR decision regarding U.S. Patent No. 8,117,526. Appellate briefing is underway. 77 Monterey Research Litigation On November 15, 2019, Monterey Research, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware (Case.

Monterey Research seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On January 22, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. On February 5, 2020, Monterey Research filed an amended complaint. On February 19, 2020, the Company filed a renewed motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. On October 13, 2020, the Court granted in part, and denied in part, the Company’s renewed motion to dismiss. On October 27, 2020, the Company filed its answer to Monterey’s complaint and also filed counterclaims based on Monterey’s breach of the parties’ pre-suit non-disclosure agreement. On December 1, 2020, Monterey filed a motion to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims. On January 5, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s motion to stay the litigation pending inter partes review of the patents-in-suit by the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. In November and December 2021 and January 2022, the USPTO issued five final written decisions in the inter partes reviews cancelling all challenged claims of five patents in suit. On August 12, 2021, Monterey filed two patent infringement complaints in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (Case. No. 6:21-cv-00839 and Case. No. 6:21-cv-00840). In the first complaint, Monterey alleges that the Company infringes two patents (8,694,776 and 9,767,303) related to memory controllers, three patents (8,572,297, 7,609,799, and 7,899,145) related to circuit designs, and one patent (6,979,640) related to semiconductor processing. In the second complaint, Monterey alleges that the Company infringes one patent (6,680,516) related to semiconductor processing. In both complaints, Monterey Research seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On October 22, 2021, Monterey Research filed an amended complaint in Case. No. 6:21-cv-00840 withdrawing its infringement claims for the ’776 and ’303 patents, and asserting an additional infringement claim for a patent related to circuit design (8,103,497).On November 15, 2021, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 8, 2021, Monterey filed its response. On December 20, 2021, the Company filed a motion to transfer the case to Austin division. City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System Litigation On September 29, 2020, the City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System, an AMD shareholder, filed a shareholder derivative complaint (the “Complaint”) against AMD and the members of its Board of Directors (collectively, “Defendants”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. See City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System v. Caldwell, et al., No. 5:20-cv-6794 (N.D. Cal.). The Complaint alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and were unjustly enriched by misrepresenting the Company’s commitment to diversity, particularly with respect to the composition of the membership of AMD’s Board of Directors and senior leadership team. On December 18, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint. On February 12, 2021, Plaintiff filed an opposition to Defendants’ motion to dismiss, and on March 12, 2021, Defendants filed a reply brief in support of the motion to dismiss. On July 1, 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss, without prejudice. On August 2, 2021, the parties filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice, and the court approved the joint stipulation on August 3, 2021. 78 Xilinx Acquisition Litigation On October 26, 2020, the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., and Xilinx, Inc. (“Xilinx”) entered a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) in which the Company will acquire Xilinx by merging Thrones Merger Sub, Inc. with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Transaction”). See Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On December 3, 2020, the Company and Xilinx filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (together with the joint proxy statement and prospectus contained therein, the “Registration Statement”) describing the Proposed Transaction and other related matters. On December 11, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a putative class action in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County, regarding the Proposed Transaction. Nunez v. Xilinx, Case No. 656971/2020 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (“Nunez”). The lawsuit alleges that the Board of Directors of Xilinx breached their fiduciary duties to Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction by allegedly failing to obtain fair, adequate and maximum consideration for Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction and by not disclosing certain material information about the Proposed Transaction in the Registration Statement. The lawsuit asserts a single claim against the Company, alleging that it aided and abetted the Xilinx directors’ breach of their fiduciary duties. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 15, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, regarding the Proposed Transaction. Shumacher v. Xilinx, Case No. 1:20-cv-10595 (S.D.N.Y.) (“Shumacher”). The lawsuit alleges that Xilinx and its Board of Directors disseminated a false and misleading Registration Statement that omitted material information regarding the Proposed Transaction, thereby violating Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The lawsuit also asserts a single claim against the Company, alleging that it acted as a controlling person of Xilinx within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by virtue of its supervisory control over the composition of the Registration Statement. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 23, 2020, a shareholder of the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York regarding the Proposed Transaction. Vazirani v. Advanced Micro Devices, Case No. 1:20-cv-10894 (S.D.N.Y) (“Vazirani”). The lawsuit alleges that the Company and its Board of Directors disseminated a false and misleading Registration Statement that omitted material information regarding the Proposed Transaction, thereby violating Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On March 22, 2021, the Nunez complaint was voluntarily dismissed, and on March 25, 2021, the Vazirani complaint was voluntarily dismissed. The Shumacher complaint was voluntarily dismissed on April 9, 2021. Future Link Systems Litigation On December 21, 2020, Future Link Systems, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Future Link Systems alleges that the Company infringes three U.S. patents: 7,983,888 (related to simulated PCI express circuitry); 6,363,466 (related to out of order data transactions); and 6,622,108 (related to interconnect testing). Future Link Systems seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On March 22, 2021, the Company filed its answer to Future Link Systems’ complaint and also filed counterclaims based on Future Link Systems’ breach of the parties’ pre-suit non-disclosure agreement. On April 12, 2021, Future Link Systems filed its answer to the Company’s counterclaims. On June 3, 2021, the Company filed a motion to transfer the case to Austin, Texas. On October 14, 2021, the Court issued an order construing certain terms in the asserted patents. On November 22, 2021, the case was reassigned to the Austin division. On January 5, 2022, the Company filed a motion to strike Future Link System’s infringement contentions, and Future Link Systems filed a response on January 19, 2022. On January 14, 2022, the USPTO instituted an IPR trial for one of the three patents in suit. On December 21, 2021, Future Link Systems LLC filed a lawsuit alleging infringement of two patents related to power management. The Company was served with the complaint on December 28, 2021. On December 28, 2021, Future Link Systems LLC filed a complaint at the United States International Trade Commission alleging infringement of the same two power management patents. Several of the Company’s customers were also named as respondents. On January 26, 2022, the USITC announced that it would institute the investigation. 79 Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability of the above listed legal proceedings, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Environmental Matters The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $ 3.8 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. NOTE 18 - Pending Acquisition On October 26, 2020, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub), and Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx (the Merger), with Xilinx surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of common stock of Xilinx (Xilinx Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx Common Stock held directly by the Company or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-assessable shares of the Company’s common stock and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any applicable withholding. As of the signing of the Merger Agreement, the transaction was valued at $35 billion. The actual valuation of the transaction could differ significantly from the estimated amount due to movements in the price of the Company’s common stock, the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and other factors. Under the Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee to Xilinx equal to $ 1.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Company’s board of directors has changed its recommendation. The Company will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $ 1.0 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals prior to October 26, 2021 (subject to automatic extension first to January 26, 2022 and then to April 26, 2022, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditions remain outstanding). On April 7, 2021, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve all the proposals relating to the Merger at a special meeting of stockholders. Xilinx stockholders also voted to approve their respective proposals relating to the Merger at a Xilinx special meeting held on the same day. The closing of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval. The Merger is currently expected to close in the first quarter of 2022. 80 NOTE 19 - Subsequent Events Subsequent to December 25, 2021, through the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements (the “issuance date”), the Company repurchased $ 1.0 billion of its common stock under the Repurchase Program. As of the issuance date, $ 1.2 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under the Repurchase Program. 81 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 82 Inventory Valuation Description of the Matter At December 25, 2021, the Company’s net inventory balance was $1,955 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities exceeding forecasted demand, by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on several factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing the above-described assumptions and management’s judgments. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles and/or identified alternative customer uses. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970. San Jose, California February 3, 2022 83 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 25, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon . Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California February 3, 2022 84 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 25, 2021, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: 1. Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; 2. Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 3. Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 85 Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 25, 2021 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function. Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics Markets The Computing and Graphics market addresses the need for computational and visual data processing in computing devices that include personal computers, laptops / notebooks, and workstations. We service this market with our CPU, GPU, APU, system-on-chip and chipset product offerings. Central Processing Unit (CPU) . A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the “brain” of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set, memory size and data access speed. Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU. GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on a video display or in a virtual environment (e.g. virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)). In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as high-performance computing (HPC), deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining and autonomous driving). Accelerated Processing Unit (APU). Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements. An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e. the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the 3 speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for example, eliminating connections between discrete chips. System-on-Chip (SoC) . An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency are improved, similar to an APU. Chipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a device or a collection of devices that allow the microprocessor to connect to a wider range of peripheral devices in the system (such as storage, optical drives, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) peripherals). Chipsets can perform essential logic functions and operate in concert with the microprocessor to manage system control and power management functions of all the devices in the system. Chipsets are most often found in larger form factor systems, typically desktop systems or larger notebook platforms, which require the expanded peripheral selection that is enabled by the chipset. Typical notebook platforms and small form factor desktop platforms usually do not utilize a chipset and instead rely on the capabilities of the APU to connect to all the required devices on the platform. Our Computing and Graphics Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and a chipset when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Infinity Fabric™, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable fast data access and high-performance. We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state. Desktop. Our microprocessors for desktop platforms currently include the AMD Ryzen™ series processors and AMD Athlon™ processors. In April 2020, we expanded our 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen desktop processor family by adding AMD Ryzen 3 3100 and AMD Ryzen 3 3300X processors with “Zen 2” core architecture to business users, gamers and creators.

Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices. Many consumers use PCs as entertainment platforms, in addition to traditional productivity and communications uses, and therefore value a richer, more visually compelling and immersive experience. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to the increased creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for playing games, capturing media, viewing online videos, editing photos and managing digital content on computing devices. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD), that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market. In addition to traditional graphics markets, there is a large and growing demand for accelerated computing, powered by graphics processors in markets such as high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, and Cloud Visualization (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure & Cloud Gaming). Traditional HPC focused on scientific research, model simulation, and exploration is driving an increased need for computing throughput at universities and government research centers. Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing area of machine learning and deep learning workloads. Graphics processors are used primarily in the training of machine learning models. The cloud visualization market is fueled by the trend to in work from home and thus the increased need for remote accessibility, and the shift from traditional desktop and notebook workloads to the cloud. The expansion of compute workloads on graphics processors is driving market expansion for traditional graphics silicon. Another area of the market for graphics compute is blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store, transmit and process sensitive and valuable data. Blockchain applications are typically performed using specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general purpose CPU or GPU. Our Graphics Products Graphics processing is a fundamental component of almost everything we create and can be found in an APU, GPU, SoC or a combination of a discrete GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to enable or increase the speed of rendering images, to help improve image resolution and color definition, and increasingly to process massive data sets for cloud and data 5 center applications. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices and entertainment platforms, including desktop PCs, notebook PCs, 2-in-1s, All-in-Ones (AIOs), professional workstations, and the data center. With each of our graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. We have developed RDNA™ 2, a high performing and power efficient graphics architecture, which is the foundation for next-generation PC gaming graphics, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X consoles. Additionally, the RDNA 2 architecture supports advanced graphics features such as ray tracing, Infinity Cache and variable rate shading. Our hardware and software components are used to implement ray tracing technology to simulate the paths of light rays moving through a movie or game scene, resulting in photorealistic 3D images. Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dGPUs) offer high-performance graphics processing across all platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition, computing devices with heterogeneous computing features can run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user. Moreover, heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level as the CPU for memory access, queuing, and execution. Discrete Desktop and Notebook Graphics . Our discrete GPUs for desktop and notebook PCs support current generation application program interfaces (APIs) like DirectX® 12 Ultimate and Vulkan®, support new displays using AMD FreeSync™, AMD FreeSync Premium, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technologies, and are designed to support VR in PC platforms. In August 2020, we announced the availability of the new AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs for the updated 27-inch iMac bringing a wide variety of graphically intensive applications and workloads to consumer and professional users. In October 2020, we unveiled the AMD Radeon RX™ 6000 series graphics cards for enthusiast-class PC gaming experiences. The AMD Radeon RX 6000 series includes the AMD Radeon RX 6800 and Radeon RX 6800 XT graphics cards as well as the Radeon RX 6900 XT built upon the AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture that spans from game consoles to PCs.

Both are designed to support a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O benchmarks and workloads. In April 2020, we announced the extension of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processor family with three new processors: AMD EPYC 7F32 (8 cores), AMD EPYC 7F52 (16 cores) and AMD EPYC 7F72 (24 cores). These new processors leverage up to 500 MHz of additional base frequency and large amounts of cache. AMD EPYC processors are powering cloud 7 instances from leading cloud providers. Embedded Processors . Our embedded processors are designed to support greater connectivity and security, and we believe they can be a strong driver for the high-performance bandwidth and storage requirements of enterprise and cloud infrastructure and “immersive computing” areas in the computing industry. Our products for embedded platforms include AMD Embedded EPYC CPUs, AMD Embedded V-Series APUs, CPUs and SoCs, AMD Embedded R-Series APUs, CPUs and SoCs, AMD Embedded G-Series SoC platform and AMD Embedded Radeon GPUs. In February 2020, we announced the expansion of the embedded family with two new AMD Ryzen Embedded R1000 low-power processors that provide customers with a thermal design power (TDP) range of 6 up to 10 watts. The AMD Ryzen Embedded R1000 family now includes the Ryzen Embedded R1102G and R1305G processors, designed for efficient power envelopes and giving customers the ability to create fanless systems. In November 2020, we launched the AMD Ryzen Embedded V2000 Series processor built with 7 nm process technology, up to eight “Zen 2” cores and seven AMD Radeon graphics CPU compute units, providing power efficiency and enterprise-class security features for embedded customers. Semi-Custom . Our semi-custom products are tailored, co-developed, high-performance, customer-specific solutions based on AMD CPU, GPU and multi-media technologies. We work closely with our customers to define solutions to precisely match the requirements of the device or application. We developed the semi-custom SoC products that power both the Sony PlayStation® 4 and Sony PlayStation ® 5 as well as the Microsoft ® Xbox One X, Microsoft ® Xbox One S, Microsoft ® Xbox Series X™ and Xbox Series S™ game consoles. Microsoft and Sony launched their new consoles in November 2020. Sales and Marketing We sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent distributors and sales representatives in both domestic and international markets. Our sales arrangements generally operate on the basis of product forecasts provided by the particular customer, but do not typically include any commitment or requirement for minimum product purchases. We primarily use purchase orders, sales order acknowledgments and contractual agreements as evidence of our sales arrangements. Our agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as payment terms, warranties and indemnities for issues specific to our products. We generally warrant that our products sold to our customers will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. We offer up to three-year limited warranties for certain product types, and sometimes provide other warranty periods based on negotiated terms with certain customers. We market and sell our latest products under the AMD trademark. Our desktop PC microprocessor product brands are AMD Ryzen™, AMD Ryzen™ PRO, Ryzen™ Threadripper™, AMD A-Series, AMD FX™, AMD Athlon™, AMD Athlon™ PRO, and AMD Pro A-Series. Our notebook and 2-in-1s for microprocessors are AMD Ryzen™ processors with Radeon™ Vega Graphics, AMD A-Series, AMD Athlon, AMD Ryzen PRO with Radeon Vega Graphics, AMD Athlon™ PRO with Radeon Vega Graphics and AMD Pro A-Series processors. Our server brands for microprocessors are AMD EPYC™ and AMD Opteron™ processors. We also sell low-power versions of our AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon, as well as AMD Geode™, AMD Ryzen, AMD EPYC, AMD R-Series and G-Series processors as embedded processor solutions. Our product brand for the consumer graphics market is AMD Radeon graphics, and AMD Embedded Radeon graphics is our product brand for the embedded graphics market. Our product brand for professional graphics products are AMD Radeon Pro and AMD FirePro™ graphics. Our product brand for data center graphics is Radeon Instinct™ and AMD Instinct accelerators for servers. We also market and sell our chipsets under AMD trademarks. We market our products through direct marketing and co-marketing programs. In addition, we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers and third parties, including market development programs, pursuant to which we may provide product information, training, marketing materials and funds. Under our co-marketing development programs, eligible customers can use market development funds as reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party systems integrating our products, subject to meeting defined criteria. Customers Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), large public cloud service providers, original design manufacturers (ODMs), system integrators and independent distributors in both 8 domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs). Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. We work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. We also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 26, 2020. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and some local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners’ business; however, a growing focus for us is the Value Added Reseller (VAR) channel which resells OEM systems to the mid-market and the small and medium business (SMB) segments. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles. Third-Party Distributors Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, and may include those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is less than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. Competition in the Microprocessor and Chipset Market Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. A variety of companies provide or have developed ARM-based microprocessors and platforms. ARM-based designs 9 are being used in the PC and server markets, which could lead to further growth and development of the ARM ecosystem. In 2020, Nvidia announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire ARM Holdings. Nvidia is our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. Competition in the Graphics Markets In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as providing preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information to our competitors in the graphics market or restricting access to external companies, while developing its own high-end discrete GPUs for both consumer and commercial applications. Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. We believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent a high and growing barrier to entry in this market. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Competition in the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Markets In the server market, we compete against Intel with our CPU server products and Nvidia with our GPU server products. In the data center, our principal competitor is Nvidia as the adoption of its proprietary CUDA software platform established its market share in HPC and machine learning. Another competitor is Intel as it builds products for acceleration in the data center, such as Intel Xe or Habana AI processors. Other competitors include numerous deep learning accelerator companies, consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups. Large cloud service providers have also shown interest in building their own products to accelerate AI. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, and where we compete primarily against Nvidia. Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. Another important area of focus is on HPC. HPC has traditionally been synonymous with scientific computing and supercomputers, but we are seeing a blurring of boundaries between HPC and machine learning along with high-performance CPU and GPU deployments going into workstations and cloud computing data centers as well as supercomputers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work on advanced memory technologies. As SoC technology advances, the memory can sometimes limit CPU performance and we work on improving memory technology to improve performance. Another area of focus is machine intelligence which is the platform for the growing field of machine learning. Our CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and APUs offer the computation capability and the flexibility required for various deployments of machine learning . We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada, China, India, Taiwan and Singapore who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters. 10 Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities We have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC) for the production of wafers for certain products, including the production of all our 7 nm products. We are also a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), pursuant to which we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU products, from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm, with limited exceptions. Other Third-Party Manufacturers We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers. Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities Wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs. Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 26, 2020, we had approximately 4,200 patents in the United States and approximately 1,000 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,600 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 7,500 issued patents and 3,000 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009. Under the cross-license agreement, we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all of each other’s patents that were first filed no later than November 11, 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the cross-license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross-license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross-license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross-license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross-license agreement. The cross-license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross-license agreement), and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross-license agreement, and in the event that the cross-license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross-license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate. Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Although such orders or agreements may provide visibility into future quarters, they may not necessarily be indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period as some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products, our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter. 11 Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Human Capital As of December 26, 2020, we had approximately 12,600 employees in our global workforce. We believe we are at our best when our culture of innovation, creative minds and people from all kinds of backgrounds work together in an engaging and open environment. Areas of focus for us include the following: Mission, Culture, and Engagement Our History - Founded in 1969 as a Silicon Valley start-up, the AMD journey began with dozens of employees focused on leading-edge semiconductor products. From those modest beginnings, we have grown into a global company achieving many important industry firsts along the way. Today, we develop high-performance computing and visualization products to solve some of the world’s toughest and most interesting challenges. Our Vision - High performance computing is transforming our lives. Our Mission - Build great products that accelerate next-generation computing experiences. Our employees are driven by this vision and mission. Innovation occurs when creative minds and diverse perspectives from all over the world work together. This is the foundation of our unique culture and the reason why AMD employees are among the most engaged in our industry. We conduct a confidential annual survey of our global workforce to measure our culture, engagement, and manager quality. The results are reviewed by the AMD Board of Directors and acted upon by our senior leadership team and individual managers at every level. Results from our 2020 survey reported continued improvement across all categories, and scores were among the very best for global companies in the technology industry. Our employees described our culture as innovative, open, and respectful, and rated the quality of our managers among the top 10% of our technology industry peers. Belonging and Inclusion Our diverse and inclusive workforce encourages employees to share their opinions and different perspectives. We believe that building a diverse talent pipeline, encouraging a culture of respect and belonging, and increasing inclusion of unique and underrepresented voices makes AMD stronger. AMD’s Employee Resource Groups encourage employee engagement and play an important role in our culture. We are focused on hiring and developing under-represented minorities and women leaders. We are proud to be led by a highly regarded CEO who has won many esteemed awards for her business and technical prowess. In 2020, Lisa Su received the chip industry’s highest honor as the 2020 recipient of the Robert N. Noyce Award. Dr. Su also ranked #2 on Fortune’s Businessperson of the Year list for her strategic vision and successful company turn around. Total Rewards We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits that are determined based on employee’s preferences. Our incentives are meritocracy-based and we have a strong pay for performance culture that we believe drives superior results. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with our peers. Development We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at AMD. We are focused on leadership progression and encourage our employees take advantage of new opportunities. Our manager and leadership development programs are highly rated and we provide specialized development programs for our employees. Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, 12 discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $4 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 13 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers and retailers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers’ potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may 16 make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused government authorities to implement numerous public health measures, including quarantines, business closures, travel bans, and restrictions related to social gathering and mobility, to contain the virus. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. While many of our offices around the world remain open, either because the pandemic has been contained in that location or to enable critical on-site business functions in compliance with government guidelines, most of our employees continue to work from home until further notice. It is uncertain as to when the measures put in place to attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 will be lifted or whether there will be additional measures put into place. If COVID-19 continues to spread or if there are further waves of the virus, we may need to further limit operations or modify our business practices in a manner that may impact our business. If our employees are not able to perform their job duties due to self-isolation, quarantine, travel restrictions or illness, or are unable to perform them as efficiently at home for an extended period of time, we may not be able to meet our product schedules, roadmaps and customer commitments and we may experience an overall lower productivity of our workforce. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to COVID-19. Although some public health measures have eased and a small portion of our employees are at work in certain offices, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our employees to health risks. Even when COVID-19 measures regarding mobility are lifted or modified, our employees’ ability to return to work may delay the return of our full workforce and the resumption of normal business operations. We have experienced some disruptions to parts of our supply chain as the result of COVID-19. We continue to monitor demand signals as we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. If the supply of our products to customers is delayed, reduced or canceled due to disruptions encountered by our third-party manufacturing, suppliers or vendors as a result of facility closures, border and port closures, and mobility limitations put on their workforces, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. COVID-19 has in the short-term and may in the long-term adversely impact the global economy, potentially leading to an economic downturn. This could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone or cancel purchases, or delay paying or default on payment of outstanding amounts due to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, we experienced some softness in PC-related sales in China, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs, during the first quarter of 2020. Also, we experienced some delays in payments from customers due to COVID-19 during the first half of 2020. COVID-19 has also led to a disruption and volatility in the global capital and financial markets. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments along with our Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months, to the extent we may require additional funding to finance our operations and capital expenditures and such funding may not be available to us as a result of contracting capital and financial markets resulting from COVID-19, it may have an adverse effect on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results will depend on future developments, which are unpredictable and highly uncertain, including the continued spread, duration and severity of the outbreak, the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, the availability and distribution of effective vaccines, and public health measures and actions taken throughout the world to contain COVID-19. The prolonged effect of COVID-19 could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our 17 product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or that may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel is seeking to expand its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. Furthermore, we may face competition from some of our customers who internally develop the same products as us. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have in the past experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation®4, Sony PlayStation®4 Pro, Microsoft® Xbox One™ S and Microsoft® Xbox One™ X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China and South Korea have instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries may create, or in the case of China are creating, their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. 18 The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Also, due to measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19, various patent offices and courts have been adversely impacted and there is a potential for delay or disruptions that might affect certain of our patent rights. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. 19 Operational and Technology Risks We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. For the production of wafers for certain products, including the production of all our 7 nanometer (nm) products, we use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSMC). We purchase wafers for all our CPU and APU products, and wafers for a certain portion of our GPU products manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm, with limited exceptions, from GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Inc. (GF). We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our 7 nm products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several subcontractors, and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers, suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, or experience uncertain social economic or political circumstances or conditions, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are a party to a wafer supply agreement (WSA) with GF that governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and is in place until 2024. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase wafers for all of our CPU and APU product requirements and wafers for a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm, with limited exceptions. We have agreed to minimum annual wafer purchase targets through 2021. If we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. We could experience significant delays 20 in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs and there is no guarantee that the ATMP JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nm product portfolio on TSMC’s 7 nm process. If TSMC is not able to manufacture wafers for our 7 nm products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We may purchase equipment, materials and substrates for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. If we are unable to procure a stable supply of substrates on an ongoing basis and at reasonable costs to meet our production requirements, we could experience a shortage in substrate supply or an increase in production costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of 21 new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen™, AMD Radeon™ and AMD EPYC™ processors using 7 nm process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customer’s products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customer’s products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. The products that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers, vendors and end users, to deploy our mitigations or create their own, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We also are subject to claims and litigation related to Spectre side- 22 channel exploits and may face additional claims or litigation for future vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. We believe that companies like AMD have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, business and system disruption attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third-party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers and consumers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to: enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and compliance with external regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. 23 Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g., BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our add-in-board (AIB) partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners 24 terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or 25 intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. 26 Legal and Regulatory Risks Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. We have equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019, the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reduced the valuation allowance against a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in $1.4 billion of deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Our deferred tax assets include net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards that can be used to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Each quarter, we consider both positive and negative evidence to determine whether all or a portion of the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. If we determine that some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable, it could result in a material expense in the period in which this determination is made which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits which remain under a valuation allowance could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce our ability to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Any changes to tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, as described in Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims, including those described in Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, including the claims described in Note 17 of our consolidated financial statements, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. 27 With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. 28 Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. The United States federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. Germany’s federal procurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, issued new supply chain labor requirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers as well as the Responsible Business Alliance have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product. Xilinx Merger and Acquisition Risks Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments, including our recently announced acquisition of Xilinx, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses, could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. For example, on October 26, 2020, we, along with a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx), whereby we agreed to acquire Xilinx (the Merger). We entered into the Merger Agreement with the belief that the Merger will result in certain benefits, including certain operational synergies and cost efficiencies, and drive product innovations. Achieving these anticipated benefits will depend on successfully combining our and Xilinx’s businesses together. It is not certain that Xilinx’s business can be successfully integrated with our business in a timely manner or at all, or that any of the anticipated benefits will be realized for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: failure to obtain applicable regulatory or stockholder approvals in a timely manner or otherwise; failure to satisfy other closing conditions to the Merger; our inability to integrate or benefit from Xilinx’s acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner; diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the Merger; failure to leverage the increased scale of the combined businesses quickly and effectively; coordinating and integrating in countries in which we have not previously operated; the potential impact of the Merger on our relationships with employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; the impairment of relationships with, or the loss of, Xilinx’s employees, vendors, suppliers and customers; adverse changes in general economic conditions in regions in which we and Xilinx operate; potential litigation associated with the Merger; difficulties in the assimilation of employees and culture; difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a larger and more complex company; challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and difficulties with harmonizing our and Xilinx’s financial reporting systems. Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention, which could materially impact the combined company. In addition, even if the operations of the businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Merger may not be realized within the anticipated time frame or at all. All of these factors could decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and negatively impact the combined company. If we cannot successfully integrate our 29 and Xilinx’s businesses and operations, or if there are delays in combining the businesses, it could negatively impact our ability to develop or sell new products and impair our ability to grow our business, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition (and as contemplated in the Merger), we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and/or incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risks of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from our business initiatives. For example, we may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, including the receipt of any future milestone payments and any royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the BIS added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. Our ability to complete the Merger is subject to closing conditions, including approval by our and Xilinx’s stockholders and the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the Merger not to be completed. The Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions as specified in the Merger Agreement. These include, among others, approvals by our and Xilinx’s stockholders, the receipt of approvals under certain competition laws and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the Merger. No assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the closing conditions will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the Merger. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, under the Merger Agreement, Xilinx will be required to pay a termination fee to us equal to $1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because Xilinx’s board of directors has changed its recommendation. We will be required to pay a termination fee to Xilinx equal to $1.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because our board of directors has changed its recommendation. We will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals by October 26, 2021 (subject to automatic extension first to January 26, 2022 and then to April 26, 2022, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditions remain outstanding). Whether or not it is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results . Whether or not it is completed, the announcement and pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions in our business: our and Xilinx’s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the ability to retain key employees; uncertainty regarding the completion of the Merger may cause customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or others to delay or defer entering into contracts, make other decisions or seek to change or cancel existing business 30 relationships; and the attention of management may be directed toward the completion of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the potential payment of termination fees and the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. Any impairment of the combined company’s tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact the combined company’s financial position and results of operations. The Merger will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, with AMD representing the accounting acquirer under this guidance. We will record assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed from Xilinx at their respective fair values at the date of completion of the Merger. Any excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of such assets and liabilities will be recorded as goodwill. In connection with the Merger, the combined company is expected to record significant goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheet. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, will be tested for impairment at least annually, and all tangible and intangible assets including goodwill will be tested for impairment when certain indicators are present. If, in the future, the combined company determines that tangible or intangible assets, including goodwill, are impaired, the combined company would record an impairment charge at that time. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of the combined company’s business could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill, which may have a material adverse impact on the combined company’s financial position and results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Risks The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from sales of assets; enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility’s credit agreement (Credit Agreement) restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that (i) on the date of such payment, an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or would result therefrom or (ii) if we would have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, a consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds 3.50x. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If under certain circumstances we fail to make a cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, could constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. Our Revolving Credit Facility also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities, make certain dispositions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). The agreements governing our notes and our Revolving Credit Facility contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under certain agreements with respect to other indebtedness would result in cross defaults under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $100 million would cause a cross default under the Revolving Credit Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under the indentures or the Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.50% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the 31 lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. The conversion of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The 2.125% Notes will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted. During the fourth calendar quarter of 2020, the sale price of our common stock for conversion was satisfied as of December 31, 2020 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2021. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2.125% Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% Notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt principal amount outstanding as of December 26, 2020 was $ 338 million. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our revolving credit facility for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Revolving Credit Facility), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Revolving Credit Facility or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Revolving Credit Facility, which would result in a default under the indentures and our Revolving Credit Facility. Upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 26, 2020, $ 338 million principal amount was outstanding, consisting of our Notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require 32 us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. General Risks Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 77% for the year ended December 26, 2020. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, fires and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as COVID-19, avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, governments worldwide have implemented, and continue to implement, measures to slow down the outbreak of COVID-19. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, disruptions to our business as these measures have, and will continue to have, an effect on our business operations and practices. Also, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve 33 internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as other non-current assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2020 compared to 2019, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019. Overview During 2020, we continued to build on our technical, operational and financial foundation to drive our long-term growth strategy. We delivered strong financial results and further extended our industry-leading product portfolio despite the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net revenue for 2020 was $9.8 billion, an increase of 45% compared to 2019 net revenue of $6.7 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2020, was 45%, compared to 43% in 2019. Our operating income for 2020 improved to $1.4 billion compared to operating income of $631 million for 2019. Our net income for 2020 improved to $2.5 billion compared to $341 million in the prior year. We recognized a $1.3 billion income tax benefit upon the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. We made significant progress towards improving our balance sheet in 2020. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 26, 2020 were $2.3 billion, compared to $1.5 billion at the end of 2019. The aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 26, 2020 was $338 million, compared to $563 million as of December 28, 2019. During 2020, we consistently executed our product roadmap and launched multiple products in leading-edge manufacturing technologies. We introduced a number of 7 nanometer (nm) products during the year, including new additions to our 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor family, the AMD Ryzen 3 3100 and AMD Ryzen 3 3300X for the mainstream market, and the AMD Ryzen 9 3900XT, AMD Ryzen 7 3800XT and AMD Ryzen 5 3600XT processors for the enthusiast market. In July 2020, we introduced the AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ PRO Processor family designed for professional workstations from OEMs to system integrators and AMD Ryzen 4000 Series desktop processors with Radeon™ graphics for consumers, gamers, streamers and creators. We also introduced AMD Athlon™ 3000 Series desktop processors using the same Zen core architecture and built-in Radeon graphics as the AMD Ryzen desktop processor family. Also, the AMD Ryzen PRO 4000 series and AMD Athlon PRO 3000 series desktop processors were introduced for the commercial market. In October 2020, we introduced the AMD Ryzen 5000 Series desktop processor family powered by “Zen 3” core architecture. We also expanded our notebook products in 2020. In May 2020, we announced the global availability of the AMD Ryzen™ PRO 4000 Series Mobile family for commercial notebooks built with enterprise-grade AMD PRO technologies, which deliver a set of security and manageability features for Enterprise IT deployments. Also, we announced the AMD Ryzen 3000 C-Series mobile processors and the AMD Athlon 3000 C-Series mobile processors for Chromebook platforms designed for multi-tasking and content creation in distance learning and remote working. With respect to our graphics products, we expanded our professional offerings with the AMD Radeon™ Pro VII workstation graphics card designed for broadcast and engineering professionals. In August 2020, we announced the availability of the new AMD Radeon Pro 5000 series GPUs for the updated 27-inch iMac bringing a wide variety of graphically intensive applications and workloads to consumer and professional users. We also introduced the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series graphics cards built on AMD RDNA™ 2 gaming architecture and designed for enthusiast-class PC gaming. In November 2020, we introduced our data center graphics processor, the AMD Instinct™ MI100 GPU accelerator, the first accelerator to use new AMD CDNA architecture dedicated to HPC workloads. We expanded our EPYC server family during the year. In April 2020, we announced the extension of the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC processor family with three new processors: AMD EPYC 7F32 (8 cores), AMD EPYC 7F52 (16 cores) and AMD EPYC 7F72 (24 cores). These new processors leverage up to 500 MHz of additional base frequency and large amounts of cache. In October 2020, we announced the AMD EPYC™ processor based Azure Dav4, Eav4, 39 Easv4 and Lsv2 VMs for use to improve real-time analysis on large volumes of data streaming from applications, websites and more. We also expanded our embedded processor family with two new AMD Ryzen Embedded R1000 low-power processors that provide customers with a thermal design power (TDP) range of 6 up to 10 watts. In November 2020, we launched the AMD Ryzen Embedded V2000 series processor built on 7 nm process technology, “Zen 2” cores and high-performance AMD Radeon graphics. While the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, and we expect that it may continue to impact our business, we experienced limited financial disruption during 2020. Although many of our offices remained open to enable critical on-site business functions in accordance with local government guidelines, most of our employees worked from home during 2020. During the second half of 2020, the majority of our employees in China returned to work and we maintained normal business operations subject to local government health measures. We continue to monitor and take measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, and support those employees who work from home so that they can be productive. We monitor demand signals as we adjust our supply chain requirements based on changing customer needs and demands. We also assess our product schedules and roadmaps to make any adjustments that may be necessary to support remote working requirements and address the geographic and market demand shifts caused by COVID-19. As part of our strategy to establish AMD as the industry’s high performance computing leader, we announced in October 2020 that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Xilinx, Inc. in an all-stock transaction. The transaction is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue Allowances. Revenue contracts with our customers include variable amounts which we evaluate under ASC 606-10-32-8 through 14 in order to determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled and which we recognize as revenue. We determine the net amount of consideration to which we are entitled by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer after adjustments to the contract price for rights of return and rebates to our OEM customers and rights of return, rebates and price protection on unsold merchandise to our distributor customers. We base our determination of necessary adjustments to the contract price by reference to actual historical activity and experience, including actual historical returns, rebates and credits issued to OEM and distributor customers adjusted, as applicable, to include adjustments, if any, for known events or current economic conditions, or both. Our estimates of necessary adjustments for distributor price incentives and price protection on unsold products held by distributors are based on actual historical incentives provided to distributor customers and known future price movements based on our internal and external market data analysis. Our estimates of necessary adjustments for OEM price incentives utilize, in addition to known pricing agreements, actual historical rebate attainment rates and estimates of future OEM rebate program attainment based on internal and external market data analysis. 40 We offer incentive programs through cooperative advertising and marketing promotions. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. We also provide limited product return rights to certain OEMs and to most distribution customers. These return rights are generally limited to a contractual percentage of the customer’s prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approve additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to revenue to account for these returns, including product restocking rights provided to distributor and OEM customers, we utilize relevant, trended actual historical product return rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or events, as applicable. Overall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to variable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known events, have been materially consistent with actual results; however, these estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. Inventory Valuation. We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inventory carrying value adjustments can be unique to each product and are based on specific facts and circumstances. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negative impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that had been written down to a level below the ultimate realized selling price in a previous period, related revenue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. We first analyze qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income Taxes . In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. 41 We regularly assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. When considering all available evidence, if we determine it is more-likely-than-not we will realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse some or all of the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider the four sources of jurisdictional taxable income: (i) carryback of net operating losses to prior years; (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences; (iii) viable and prudent tax planning strategies; and (iv) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. Through the end of 2020, we demonstrated consistent, continued and increasing profitability over the preceding three-year period. Our ability to sustain and grow our profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial products, including our newly released desktop, mobile and graphics processors, greater market acceptance for our server products, the successful adoption of our new game console processor products, and our leadership in the continued development of HPC products. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of our industry, the continued performance and market acceptance of our new products, and the impact of such market acceptance on our estimates of future profitability. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded that our history of profitable operating results, including the current period results, along with increasingly favorable forecasts of continued future profitability, provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of a certain amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets, accordingly, the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.6 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitations, including limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of income. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex, multi-jurisdictional tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge could result. Results of Operations We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 14 – Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. 42 The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018. 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 6,432 $ 4,709 $ 4,125 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 3,331 2,022 2,350 Total net revenue $ 9,763 $ 6,731 $ 6,475 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 1,266 $ 577 $ 470 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 391 263 163 All Other (288) (209) (182) Total operating income $ 1,369 $ 631 $ 451 Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $6.4 billion in 2020 increased by 37%, compared to $4.7 billion in 2019, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in unit shipments and a 2% increase in average selling price. The increase in unit shipments was primarily due to higher demand for our Ryzen processors. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors from higher sales of our Ryzen processors, which have a higher average selling price, partially offset by lower average selling price for our Radeon products due to product cycle timing. Computing and Graphics operating income was $1.3 billion in 2020 compared to $577 million in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by the margin contribution from higher sales which more than offset higher operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $3.3 billion in 2020 increased by 65% compared to net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2019, primarily driven by higher sales of our EPYC server processors and higher semi-custom revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $391 million in 2020 compared to $263 million in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to the margin contribution from the increase in revenue which more than offset higher operating expenses in 2020 and a $60 million licensing gain recorded in 2019. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other operating loss of $288 million in 2020 included stock-based compensation expense of $274 million and acquisition-related costs of $14 million. All Other operating loss of $209 million in 2019 included $197 million of stock-based compensation expense and a $12 million contingent loss accrual on a legal matter. 43 Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Expense and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2020, 2019 and 2018: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions, except for percentages) Net revenue $ 9,763 $ 6,731 $ 6,475 Cost of sales 5,416 3,863 4,028 Gross profit 4,347 2,868 2,447 Gross margin 45 % 43 % 38 % Research and development 1,983 1,547 1,434 Marketing, general and administrative 995 750 562 Licensing gain — (60) — Interest expense (47) (94) (121) Other expense, net (47) (165) — Income tax provision (benefit) (1,210) 31 (9) Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 45% in 2020 compared to 43% in 2019. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors in 2020, which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average, partially offset by sales of semi-custom products and Radeon products, which have a lower gross margin than the corporate average. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $2.0 billion in 2020 increased by $436 million, or 28%, compared to $1.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise and Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, due to an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $995 million in 2020 increased by $245 million, or 33%, compared to $750 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, and an increase in headcount and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Licensing Gain During 2019, we recognized $60 million as licensing gain associated with the licensed IP to THATIC JV. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. Interest Expense Interest expense of $47 million in 2020 decreased by $47 million compared to $94 million in 2019, primarily due to lower debt balances. Other Expense, Net Other expense, net decreased in 2020 by $118 million from net of $165 million in 2019. Other expense, net for both periods primarily comprised of losses on redemptions, repurchases and conversions of our outstanding debt and convertible debt instruments. 44 Income Taxes Provision (Benefit) Through the end of 2020, we demonstrated consistent, continued and increasing profitability over the preceding three-year period. Our ability to sustain and grow such profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of our consumer and commercial products including our newly released desktop, mobile and graphics processors, greater market acceptance for our server products, the successful adoption of our new game console processor products, and our continued leadership in the development of HPC products. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, we considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of our industry, the continued performance and market acceptance of our new products, and the impact of such market acceptance on forecasts of future profitability. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we concluded that our history of profitable operating results, including the current period results, along with increasingly favorable forecasts of continued future profitability, provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of a certain amount of our U.S. deferred tax assets and, accordingly, the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. We continue to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $1.6 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitations, including limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of income. We recorded an income tax benefit of $1.2 billion in 2020 and an income tax provision of $31 million in 2019. The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $13 million of state and foreign taxes, and a $75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table in the tax footnote. The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $22 million of withholding taxes related to cross-border transactions and $22 million of foreign income taxes in profitable locations, partially offset by a $13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 77% in 2020 and 74% in 2019. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 26, 2020, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.3 billion compared to $1.5 billion as of December 28, 2019. The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 94% as of December 26, 2020, and 90% as of December 28, 2019. Our operating, investing and financing cash flow activities for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,071 $ 493 $ 34 Investing activities (952) (149) (170) Financing activities 6 43 28 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 125 $ 387 $ (108) Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $338 million and $563 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. 45 We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance along with our Revolving Credit Facility entered into in June 2019 (refer to Note 6 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. Operating Activities Our working capital cash inflows and outflows from operations are primarily cash collections from our customers, payments for inventory purchases and payments for employee-related expenditures. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to our net income of $2.5 billion, adjusted for non-cash adjustments of $488 million and net cash outflows of $931 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $219 million increase in accounts receivable driven primarily by $1.1 billion higher revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by higher collections due to better revenue linearity in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, a $417 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in product build in support of customer demand, a $231 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits, a $513 million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers, offset by a $574 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals and higher accrued annual employee incentives due to improved financial performance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $493 million in 2019, primarily due to our net income of $341 million, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating charges of $694 million and net cash outflows of $542 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a $623 million increase in account receivable driven primarily by $708 million higher revenue during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, a $137 million increase in inventories driven by an increase in wafer purchases during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, and a $176 million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets due primarily to an increase in vendor credits and other non-current assets, partially offset by a $153 million increase in accounts payable due to an increase in inventory purchases and a $220 million increase in accrued liabilities and other driven by higher marketing accruals. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $952 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of $850 million for purchases of short-term investments and $294 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $192 million for maturities of short-term investments. Net cash used in investing activities was $149 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of $217 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $41 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $6 million in 2020, which primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee equity plans of $85 million, partially offset by $78 million of common stock repurchased to cover employee withholding taxes on vesting of employee equity grants. We borrowed $200 million of short-term debt during the second quarter of 2020 and paid off the balance during the third quarter of 2020. Net cash provided by financing activities was $43 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of $449 million from the warrant exercised by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and $74 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by $473 million of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year. 46 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 26, 2020, and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 and thereafter Term debt (1) $ 338 $ — $ 312 $ — $ — $ — $ 26 Aggregate interest obligation (2) 54 25 25 1 1 1 1 Other long-term liabilities (3) 159 55 64 19 10 8 3 Operating leases (4) 284 52 55 48 41 34 54 Purchase obligations (5) 3,032 2,971 7 15 15 15 9 Total contractual obligations (6) $ 3,867 $ 3,103 $ 463 $ 83 $ 67 $ 58 $ 93 (1) See Note 6 – Debt and Revolving Credit Facility of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (2) Represents interest obligations, payable in cash, for our outstanding debt. (3) Amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months. (4) See Note 16 – Commitments and Guarantees of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) Represents purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (6) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Our total gross unrecognized tax benefits were $119 million as of December 26, 2020. We have foreign and U.S. state tax audits in process at any one point in time. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligations table. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 26, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 47 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 26, 2020, our investment portfolio consisted of time deposits and commercial paper. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 26, 2020, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 26, 2020, substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and assessing potential impairment, if any, of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Substantially all the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales, representing a single performance obligation. Non-custom products The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Non-custom product arrangements generally comprise a single performance obligation. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Constraints of variable consideration have not been material. 55 Custom products Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders, for which the Company has an enforceable right to payment, and which have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, over the time of production of the products by the Company. The Company utilizes a cost-based input method, calculated as cost incurred plus estimated margin, to determine the amount of revenue to recognize for in-process, but incomplete, customer orders at a reporting date. The Company believes that a cost-based input method is the most appropriate manner to measure how the Company satisfies its performance obligations to customers because the effort and costs incurred best depict the Company’s satisfaction of its performance obligation. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Custom products arrangements involve a single performance obligation. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with custom products. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the Company’s IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. The Company evaluates whether the licensing component is distinct. A licensing component is distinct if it is both (i) capable of being distinct and (ii) distinct in the context of the arrangement. If the license is not distinct it is combined with the development services as a single performance obligation and recognized over time. If the license is distinct, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that solely involve the sale or licensing of its patents or IP. Generally, there are no performance obligations beyond transferring the designated license to the Company’s patents or IP. Accordingly, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer has the ability to benefit from the license. There are no variable consideration estimates associated with either combined development and intellectual property arrangements or for standalone arrangements involving either the sale or licensing of IP. Total revenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 18 %, 19 % and 29 % of the Company’s revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Inventories The Company values inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for its products, the Company considers assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for its products, and changes in technology or customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost or net realizable value reserves, the Company considers assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory carrying value adjustments may be required . Goodwill The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. 56 The Company first analyzes qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Contingencies From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Other investments in time deposits due within 12 months and marketable securities are included in short-term investments. Classification of marketable securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. If an available-for-sale debt security’s fair value is less than its amortized cost basis, then the Company evaluates whether the decline is the result of a credit loss, in which case an impairment is recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized gains and losses not attributable to credit losses are included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on development services recognized as revenue but not yet invoiced to customers and semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within twelve months. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, consisting of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated 57 potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company does not believe the receivable balance from its customers represents a significant credit risk. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. When the Company determines the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, it then determines whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable or when the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is not a commonly quoted rate and is derived through a combination of inputs including the Company’s credit rating and the impact of full collateralization. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company believes it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As allowed by the guidance, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $ 314 million, $ 217 million and $ 176 million, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes model. For time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase plan (ESPP) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using 58 the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to RSUs with performance or market conditions (PRSUs), which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. The assessment requires significant judgment and is performed in each of the applicable taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2020 using the modified retrospective adoption method. This standard did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. This standard simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and its application of the derivatives scope exception for contracts in its own equity by eliminating some of the models that require separating embedded conversion features from convertible instruments. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and enhances disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted, and can be adopted through either a modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings or a full retrospective method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3 – Supplemental Financial Statement Information Short-term Investments As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 400 million of time deposits and $ 295 million of commercial paper.

The Company expects to recognize $ 174 million of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations did not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less. NOTE 4 – Related Parties—Equity Joint Ventures ATMP Joint Venture s The Company holds a 15 % equity interest in two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV) with affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd, a Chinese joint stock company. The Company has no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. The Company accounts for its equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to its significant influence over the ATMP JV. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to the Company. The Company assists the ATMP JV in its management of certain raw material inventory. The purchases from and resales to the ATMP JV of inventory under the Company’s inventory management program are reported within purchases and resales with the ATMP JV and do not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company’s purchases from the ATMP JV during 2020 and 2019 amounted to $ 831 million and $ 660 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the amounts payable to the ATMP JV were $ 78 million and $ 213 million, respectively, and are included in Payables to related parties on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s resales to the ATMP JV during 2020 and 2019 amounted to $ 28 million and $ 56 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company had receivables from ATMP JV of $ 10 million and $ 7 million, respectively, included in Receivables from related parties on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. During 2020, the Company recorded a gain of $ 5 million in Equity income (loss) in investee on its consolidated statements of operations. During 2019, the Company did no t record any gain or loss in Equity income (loss) in investee. During 2018, the Company recorded a $ 2 million loss in Equity income (loss) in investee, which included certain expenses incurred by the Company on behalf of the ATMP JV. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the ATMP JV were approximately $ 63 million and $ 58 million, respectively. THATIC Joint Ventures The Company holds equity interests in two joint ventures (collectively, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity. The Company holds a majority interest in one of the joint ventures and a minority interest in the other. The Company is not a primary beneficiary of the THATIC JV and, as such, the Company does not consolidate either of these entities and accounts for its equity interests in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s share in the net losses of the THATIC JV is not recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations since the Company is not obligated to fund the THATIC JV’s losses in excess of the Company’s investment in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of both December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. In February 2016, the Company licensed certain of its intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of $ 293 million in license fees payable over several years upon achievement of certain milestones. The Company also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. The Company classifies Licensed IP income and royalty income, associated with the February 2016 agreement, as licensing gain within operating income. In March 2017, the Company entered into a development and intellectual property agreement (Development and IP) with the THATIC JV, and also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. The Company classifies Development and IP income and royalty income, associated with the March 2017 agreement, as revenue once earned. 61 The Company recognized $ 60 million as licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP during 2019. During 2018, the Company recognized $ 86 million of IP-related revenue upon completion of all technology milestones under the Development and IP agreement. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had no receivables from the THATIC JV. The Company’s receivable from the THATIC JV was $ 13 million as of December 28, 2019, included in Receivables from related parties on its consolidated balance sheets. In June 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. The Company is complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. NOTE 5 – Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill as of both December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 289 million, which was all allocated to reporting units within the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. In the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to its reporting units. NOTE 6 – Debt and Revolving Credit Facility Debt The Company’s total debt as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 consisted of: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) 7.50 % Senior Notes Due 2022 ( 7.50 % Notes) $ 312 $ 312 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) 26 251 Total debt (principal amount) 338 563 Unamortized debt discount for 2.125 % Notes ( 7 ) ( 73 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs for 2.125 % Notes — ( 3 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs for 7.50 % Notes ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Total long-term debt (net) $ 330 $ 486 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, the Company issued $ 805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes). The 2.125 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017. As of December 26, 2020, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2.125 % Notes was $ 26 million. The 2.125 % Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.125 % Notes, holders of the 2.125 % Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. 62 On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The event described in (1) above was met during the fourth calendar quarter of 2020 and, as a result, the 2.125 % Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2021 and remain convertible until March 31, 2021. During 2020, holders of the 2.125 % Notes converted $ 225 million principal amount of these notes, for which the Company issued approximately 28 million shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $ 8.00 per share. The Company recorded a loss of $ 54 million from these conversions in Other expense, net on its consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125 % Notes. As such, no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125 % Notes and the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125 % Notes as permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 26, 2020. The determination of whether or not the 2.125 % Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $ 91.81 on December 24, 2020, the last trading day of 2020, the if-converted value of the 2.125 % Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $ 272 million. The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes is 8 %. This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125 % Notes for the year ended December 26, 2020: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Contractual interest expense $ 4 $ 15 Interest cost related to amortization of debt issuance costs $ — $ 1 Interest cost related to amortization of the debt discount $ 6 $ 22 The carrying amount of the equity component of the 2.125 % Notes was $ 10 million and $ 95 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. 7.50 % Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012, the Company issued $ 500 million of its 7.50 % Senior Notes due 2022 ( 7.50 % Notes). The 7.50 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50 % Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50 % Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As of December 26, 2020, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50 % Notes was $ 312 million. Prior to August 15, 2022, the Company may redeem some or all of the 7.50 % Notes at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 7.50 % Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture, at a repurchase price of 101 % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 7.50 % Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 7.50 % Notes. Debt Covenants and Seniority The 7.50 % Notes require the Company to comply with certain financial covenants and a number of restrictive covenants. The 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes rank equally with the Company’s existing and future senior debt and are senior to all of the Company’s future subordinated debt. The 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes rank junior to all of the Company’s future senior secured debt to the extent of the collateral securing such debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and liabilities of the Company’s subsidiaries. 63 Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes The Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 7.50 % Notes and 2.125 % Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so. Revolving Credit Facility On June 7, 2019, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit facility for up to $ 500 million (the Revolving Credit Facility) pursuant to a credit agreement by and among the Company, as borrower, the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement). The Revolving Credit Facility consists of a $ 500 million, five-year secured revolving loan facility, including a $ 50 million swingline subfacility and a $ 75 million sublimit for letters of credit. Prior to the third quarter ended September 26, 2020, obligations under the Credit Agreement were secured by a lien on substantially all the Company’s property, other than intellectual property. During the third quarter ended September 26, 2020, as a result of upgrades of the Company’s debt ratings, the security requirements under the Credit Agreement were terminated and the liens on the Company’s collateral were released. The Credit Agreement also provides the ability to increase the Revolving Credit Facility or incur incremental term loans or other incremental equivalent. The Company’s available borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are also subject to reduction. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the base rate at the Company’s option (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a total leverage covenant. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. On April 6, 2020, the Company borrowed $ 200 million under the Credit Agreement via the LIBOR rate loan option at an annual interest rate of 2.37 %. The Company repaid the $ 200 million borrowing plus interest on July 6, 2020. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 13 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants under the Credit Agreement. Future Payments on Total Debt As of December 26, 2020, the Company’s future debt payment obligations were as follows: Term Debt (Principal only) (In millions) 2022 $ 312 2026 26 Total $ 338 NOTE 7 – Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company had $ 295 million and $ 37 million of commercial paper, respectively, included in Short-term investments on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The commercial paper is classified within Level 2 as its fair value estimates were based on quoted prices for comparable instruments . 64 In addition, as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the Company also had approximately $ 46 million and $ 30 million, respectively, of investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Company’s deferred compensation plan, which were included in Other non-current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 28, 2019, the Company also had approximately $ 4 million of investments in money market funds, used as collateral for letters of credit deposits, which were included in Other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These money market funds and mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its long-term debt. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company’s long-term debt are as follows: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (In millions) Long-term debt, net $ 330 $ 642 $ 486 $ 1,823 The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt are based on Level 2 inputs as the fair value is based on quoted prices for the Company’s debt and comparable instruments in inactive markets. The Company’s 2.125 % Notes, included in Long-term debt, net, above, were convertible at the option of the holder as of December 26, 2020. The estimated fair value of the 2.125 % Notes as of December 26, 2020 takes into account the value of the Company’s stock price of $ 91.81 as of December 24, 2020, the last trading date for the year ended December 26, 2020 and the initial conversion price of approximately $ 8.00 per share of common stock. The fair value of the Company’s time deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing terms. Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges Designated as Accounting Hedges and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts not Designated as Accounting Hedges The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to future forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These contracts generally mature within 12 months and are designated as accounting hedges. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the notional values of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges were $ 501 million and $ 467 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain receivables or payables denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These forward contracts generally mature within 3 months and are not designated as accounting hedges. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the notional values of outstanding contracts were $ 254 million and $ 272 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was not material as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. NOTE 8 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income (loss). 65 The table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss): 2020 2019 2018 Gains (losses) on cash flow hedges: (In millions) Beginning balance $ — $ ( 8 ) $ 6 Net unrealized gains (losses) arising during the period 18 2 ( 19 ) Net losses (gains) reclassified into income during the period ( 1 ) 6 5 Total other comprehensive income (loss) 17 8 ( 14 ) Ending balance $ 17 $ — $ ( 8 ) NOTE 9 – Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in time deposits, available-for-sale debt securities and trade receivables. The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1 or better. The Company invests in tax-exempt securities including municipal notes and bonds and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral. The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. The Company’s top three customers with the highest accounts receivable balances each accounted for approximately 18 %, 17 % and 6 %, respectively, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 26, 2020 and 15 %, 9 % and 8 %, respectively, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 28, 2019. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality. NOTE 10 – Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the Company’s stock options, RSUs (including PRSUs), common stock to be issued under the ESPP and warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. 66 The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income for basic earnings per share $ 2,490 $ 341 $ 337 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Interest expense related to the 2.125% Notes 1 — — Net income for diluted earnings per share $ 2,491 $ 341 $ 337 Denominator Basic weighted average shares 1,184 1,091 982 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity plans and warrants 20 29 82 2.125% Notes 3 — — Diluted weighted average shares 1,207 1,120 1,064 Earnings per share: Basic $ 2.10 $ 0.31 $ 0.34 Diluted $ 2.06 $ 0.30 $ 0.32 Potential shares from employee equity plans and the impact from the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes up to the conversion date, totaling 22 million for 2020, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. Potential shares from employee equity plans, the impact from the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes up to the conversion date and the assumed conversion of the remaining outstanding 2.125 % Notes, totaling 93 million and 105 million shares for 2019 and 2018, respectively, were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. NOTE 11 – Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation Common Stock Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: Year Ended December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Balance, beginning of period 1,170 1,005 967 Common stock issued under employee equity plans 14 20 31 Common stock repurchases for tax withholding on equity awards ( 1 ) — — Issuance of common stock upon warrant exercise — 75 — Issuance of common stock to settle convertible debt 28 69 — Issuance of treasury stock to partially settle debt — 1 7 Balance, end of period 1,211 1,170 1,005 Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s employee equity programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 2004 Plan). In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company introduced the 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the 2017 Plan). 67 Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three-year period from the date of grant and expire within seven years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and PRSUs. Stock Options. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $ 0.00 per share. PRSUs. PRSUs can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0 % to 250 % of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award. ESPP. Under the 2017 Plan, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 10 % of their eligible earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six-month offering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had 57 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 22 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested RSUs, including PRSUs, under the 2004 Plan. In addition, the Company had 40 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the 2017 plan. Valuation and Expense Stock-based compensation expense was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 6 $ 6 $ 4 Research and development 173 129 91 Marketing, general, and administrative 95 62 42 Total stock-based compensation expense before income taxes 274 197 137 Income tax benefit ( 42 ) — — Total stock-based compensation expense, net of income taxes $ 232 $ 197 $ 137 Stock Options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 was $ 38.49 , $ 13.31 and $ 7.62 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 57.87 % 52.60 % - 56.51 % 51.51 % - 60.46 % Risk-free interest rate 0.18 % 1.53 % - 2.51 % 2.20 % - 2.83 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected life (in years) 4.3 3.94 - 3.95 3.92 - 3.94 The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption. The risk-free interest rate is 68 based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. The following table summarizes stock option activity and related information: Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions, except share price) Balance as of December 28, 2019 10 $ 7.56 Granted — $ 84.85 Exercised ( 3 ) $ 3.62 Balance as of December 26, 2020 7 $ 12.91 $ 589 2.92 Exercisable December 26, 2020 6 $ 7.01 $ 538 2.43 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 180 million, $ 84 million and $ 67 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 19 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.66 years. Time-based RSUs. The weighted-average grant date fair values of time-based RSUs granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 78.59 , $ 32.52 and $ 17.66 per share, respectively. The following table summarizes time-based RSU activity and related information: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions except share price) Unvested shares as of December 28, 2019 18 $ 22.93 Granted 4 $ 78.59 Forfeited ( 1 ) $ 30.82 Vested ( 9 ) $ 20.67 Unvested shares as of December 26, 2020 12 $ 43.98 $ 1,078 1.13 The total fair value of time-based RSUs vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 642 million, $ 395 million and $ 315 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 462 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to time-based RSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.69 years. PRSUs. The weighted-average grant date fair values of PRSUs granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 122.95 , $ 50.00 and $ 21.67 , respectively, using the following assumptions: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 55.74 % - 60.10 % 60.54 % - 62.52 % 63.77 % - 67.97 % Risk-free interest rate 0.14 % - 1.41 % 1.56 % - 2.49 % 2.06 % - 2.82 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected term (in years) 2.48 - 3.00 2.48 - 5.00 2.48 - 3.00 The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock and risk-free interest rate based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the PRSUs grant at the date closest to the grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of PRSUs represents the requisite service periods of these PRSUs. 69 The following table summarizes PRSU activity and related information: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions except share price) Unvested shares as of December 28, 2019 3 $ 36.13 Granted 1 $ 122.95 Forfeited — $ 45.25 Vested ( 1 ) $ 16.45 Unvested shares as of December 26, 2020 3 $ 55.63 $ 248 2.25 The total fair value of PRSUs vested during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 76 million, $ 65 million and $ 84 million, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 102 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to PRSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.73 years. ESPP. The weighted-average grant date fair value for the ESPP during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 20.97 , $ 9.96 and $ 4.71 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 55.16 % - 66.53 % 48.95 % - 67.02 % 45.88 % - 66.66 % Risk-free interest rate 0.11 % - 0.15 % 1.58 % - 2.46 % 2.05 % - 2.52 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected term (in years) 0.50 0.50 0.50 The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the ESPP grant at the date closest to the ESPP grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of the ESPP represents the six-month offering period. During 2020, 2 million shares of common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a purchase price of $ 37.81 resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of $ 75 million. As of December 26, 2020, the Company had $ 12 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 0.37 years. NOTE 12 – Retirement Benefit Plans The Company provides retirement benefit plans in the United States and certain foreign countries. The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan that allows participating employees in the United States to contribute as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company matches 75 % of employees’ contributions up to 6 % of their eligible compensation. The Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $ 29 million , $ 25 million and $ 21 million, respectively. NOTE 13 – Income Taxes Income before income taxes consists of the following: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) U.S. $ 1,213 $ 334 $ 114 Non-U.S. 67 38 214 Total pre-tax income including equity income (loss) in investee $ 1,280 $ 372 $ 328 70 The income tax provision (benefit) consists of: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Current: U.S. Federal $ — $ ( 13 ) $ 12 U.S. State and Local 5 1 — Non-U.S. 8 50 ( 17 ) Total 13 38 ( 5 ) Deferred: U.S. Federal ( 1,193 ) — — U.S. State and Local ( 28 ) — — Non-U.S. ( 2 ) ( 7 ) ( 4 ) Total ( 1,223 ) ( 7 ) ( 4 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ ( 1,210 ) $ 31 $ ( 9 ) The table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total income tax provision (benefit). 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Statutory federal income tax expense at 21% $ 269 $ 78 $ 69 State taxes ( 6 ) 1 1 Foreign withholding taxes (refund) 10 22 ( 29 ) Foreign rate detriment / (benefit) ( 3 ) 2 2 Valuation allowance change ( 1,301 ) ( 59 ) ( 64 ) Research credits ( 57 ) — ( 1 ) Excess tax benefits relating to share-based compensation ( 116 ) — — Tax Reform Act — ( 13 ) 13 Other ( 6 ) — — Income tax provision (benefit) $ ( 1,210 ) $ 31 $ ( 9 ) The income tax benefit in 2020 was primarily due to $ 1.3 billion of tax benefit from the valuation allowance release in the U.S. This benefit was partially offset by approximately $ 10 million of withholding tax expense related to cross-border transactions, $ 13 million of state and foreign taxes and $ 75 million increase in valuation allowance against certain state and foreign tax credits, which are reflected as part of the state taxes and foreign rate benefit in the reconciliation table above. The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $ 22 million of withholding tax related to cross-border transactions and $ 22 million of tax in foreign locations, partially offset by a $ 13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year. The income tax provision in 2018 was primarily due to a $ 36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, partially offset by $ 13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, a $ 7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $ 7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. 71 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were as follows: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryovers $ 1,029 $ 1,357 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 514 257 Acquired intangibles and goodwill — 50 Federal and state tax credit carryovers 569 584 Foreign research and development ITC credits 489 429 Capitalized costs 174 232 Lease liability 72 57 Other 149 105 Total deferred tax assets 2,996 3,071 Less: valuation allowance ( 1,576 ) ( 2,867 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 1,420 204 Deferred tax liabilities: Right-of-use assets ( 62 ) ( 49 ) Discount of convertible notes ( 2 ) ( 16 ) Undistributed foreign earnings ( 114 ) ( 111 ) Other ( 8 ) ( 17 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 186 ) ( 193 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,234 $ 11 The movement in the deferred tax valuation allowance was as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 2,867 $ 2,443 $ 2,621 Charges (reductions) to income tax expense/other accounts* ( 1,301 ) ( 61 ) ( 59 ) Net (deductions) recoveries + 10 485 ( 119 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,576 $ 2,867 $ 2,443 * Amounts recorded against other accounts are not material + The 2019 and 2020 net recoveries were primarily related to net originating deferred tax assets and newly generated tax credits Deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The breakdown between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 is as follows: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Deferred tax assets $ 1,245 $ 22 Deferred tax liabilities ( 11 ) ( 11 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,234 $ 11 72 Through the end of 2020, the Company demonstrated consistent and continued profitability over the preceding three-year period. The Company’s ability to sustain and grow its such profitability is supported by the continued positive momentum of its consumer and commercial products including its newly released desktop, mobile and graphics processors, greater market acceptance for its server products, the successful adoption of its new game console processor products, and its continued leadership in the development of HPC products. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, the Company considered the highly dynamic and competitive landscape of its industry, the continued performance and market acceptance of its new products, and the impact of such market acceptance on forecasts of future profitability. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company concluded that its history of profitable operating results, including the current period results, along with increasingly favorable forecasts of continued future profitability, provided sufficient positive evidence supporting the realizability of a certain amount of its U.S. deferred tax assets and, accordingly, the release of the related valuation allowance previously recorded against these deferred tax assets, resulting in a tax benefit of $ 1.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of approximately $ 1.6 billion for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The federal valuation allowance maintained is due to current limitations, including limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The state and foreign valuation allowance maintained is due to lack of sufficient sources of income. The Company’s United States federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 26, 2020, were $ 5.2 billion and $ 343 million, respectively. The United States federal net operating losses will expire between 2029 and 2037, and the state net operating losses will expire at various dates through 2039. The federal tax credits of $ 385 million will expire at various dates between 2021 and 2040. The state tax credits of $ 252 million will expire at various dates between 2021 through 2035 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $ 494 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2026 and 2040. Under current U.S. tax law the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested are anticipated to be withholding taxes from local jurisdictions and non-conforming U.S. state jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $ 304 million as of December 26, 2020. A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits was as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 65 $ 49 $ 49 Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 41 5 1 Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years ( 15 ) — ( 1 ) Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 30 15 3 Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Decreases for lapsing of the statute of limitations ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance at end of year $ 119 $ 65 $ 49 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $ 77 million, $ 17 million and $ 9 million as of December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has provided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, which is open for years from 2007 onwards due to the net operating losses. 73 NOTE 14 – Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. The Company has the following two reportable segments: • the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs and development services. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. • the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services and technology for game consoles. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments.

The leases expire at various dates through 2028, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to five years. 75 For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded $ 59 million, $ 56 million and $ 53 million, respectively, of operating lease expense, including short-term lease expense. For 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 27 million and $ 25 million, respectively, of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For 2020 and 2019, cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $ 55 million and $ 47 million, respectively. The Company’s finance leases and short-term leases are immaterial. Supplemental information related to leases is as follows: December 26, 2020 Weighted-average remaining lease term – operating leases 5.56 years Weighted-average discount rate – operating leases 5.29 % Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease liabilities as of December 26, 2020 are as follows: Year (In millions) 2021 $ 52 2022 55 2023 48 2024 41 2025 34 2026 and thereafter 54 Total minimum lease payments 284 Less: interest ( 42 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 242 Less: current portion ( 41 ) Total long-term operating lease liabilities $ 201 Certain other operating leases contain provisions for escalating lease payments subject to changes in the consumer price index. Purchase and Other Contractual Obligations The Company’s purchase obligations primarily include the Company’s obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties. The Company also had other contractual obligations, primarily included in Other long-term liabilities and Accrued liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets, which primarily consisted of $ 149 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses that will be paid through 2025. Total future unconditional purchase obligations as of December 26, 2020 were as follows: Year (In millions) 2021 $ 3,026 2022 71 2023 34 2024 25 2025 23 2026 and thereafter 12 Total unconditional purchase commitments $ 3,191 76 Warranties and Indemnities The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year . The Company may also offer one to three-year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are as follows: December 26, 2020 December 28, 2019 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 15 $ 13 Provisions during the period 82 31 Settlements during the period ( 60 ) ( 29 ) Ending balance $ 37 $ 15 In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. In addition, the impact from changes in estimates for pre-existing warranties has been immaterial. NOTE 17 – Contingencies Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company’s common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on the Company’s 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against the Company and certain of its officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of the 77 Company’s insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On January 30, 2018, the Wessels and Hamilton plaintiffs amended their complaints. On February 2, 2018, the Ha plaintiff also filed an amended complaint. On February 22, 2018, the Company filed motions to dismiss the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs’ amended complaints. On April 2, 2018, the Company filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the Wessels amended complaint. On July 23, 2018, the Santa Clara Superior Court sustained the Company’s demurrer in the Wessels case, dismissing all claims in that matter with prejudice. The Wessels plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints. The Hamilton plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 8, 2018, and the Ha plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary reversal of the order dismissing their claims. The Company opposed this motion on December 13, 2018, and the Court denied it on February 25, 2019. On March 16, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the Ha complaint and the time to seek further appeals has since expired. On the same day, the Ninth Circuit also reversed and remanded the district court’s dismissal of the Hamilton complaint for further consideration of defendants’ motion to dismiss. Following supplemental briefing, that motion to dismiss remains pending. On August 27, 2020, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the Wessels complaint and the time to seek further appeals has since expired. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Hauck et al. Litigation Since January 19, 2018, three putative class action complaints have been filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: (1) Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc., Case No. 5:18-cv-0047, filed on January 19, 2018; (2) Brian Speck et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-0744, filed on February 4, 2018; and (3) Nathan Barnes and Jonathan Caskey-Medina, et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-00883, filed on February 9, 2018. On April 9, 2018, the court consolidated these cases and ordered that Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc. serve as the lead case. On June 13, 2018, six plaintiffs (from California, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts) filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that the Company failed to disclose its processors’ alleged vulnerability to Spectre. Plaintiffs further allege that the Company’s processors cannot perform at their advertised processing speeds without exposing consumers to Spectre, and that any “patches” to remedy this security vulnerability will result in degradation of processor performance. The plaintiffs seek damages under several causes of action on behalf of a nationwide class and four state subclasses (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana) of consumers who purchased the Company’s processors and/or devices containing AMD processors. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees, equitable relief, and restitution. Pursuant to the court’s order directing the parties to litigate only eight of the causes of action in the consolidated amended complaint initially, the Company filed a motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018. On October 29, 2018, after the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed one of their claims, the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed six causes of action with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint on December 6, 2018. On January 3, 2019, the Company again moved to dismiss the subset of claims currently at issue. On April 4, 2019, the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed all claims currently at issue with prejudice. On May 6, 2019, the court granted the parties’ stipulation and request under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) to enter a partial final judgment and certify for appeal the court’s April 4, 2019 dismissal order, and on that same date, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their remaining claims pursuant to an agreement whereby, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company agreed to toll the statute of limitations and/or statute of repose. On May 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing has completed for the appeal. On May 15, 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s ruling dismissing the subset of claims currently at issue against the Company. On August 14, 2020, the district court dismissed the remaining claims with prejudice. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 78 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, the Company filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. On July 22, 2019, the Company’s motion to dismiss in the Polaris case was denied. On August 23, 2019, the Court held a claim construction hearing in each case. On May 14, 2020, at the request of Polaris, the Court dismissed all claims related to one of the two patents in suite in the Polaris case. On June 10, 2020, the Court granted AMD’s motions to stay the Polaris and Aquila cases pending the completion of inter partes review of each of the patents-in-suit in those cases by the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Monterey Research Litigation On November 15, 2019, Monterey Research, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Monterey Research alleges that the Company infringes six U.S. patents: 6,534,805 (related to SRAM cell design); 6,629,226 (related to read interface protocols); 6,651,134 (related to memory devices); 6,765,407 (related to programmable digital circuits); 6,961,807 (related to integrated circuits and associated memory systems); and 8,373,455 (related to output buffer circuits). Monterey Research seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On January 22, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. On February 5, 2020, Monterey Research filed an amended complaint. On February 19, 2020, the Company filed a renewed motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. On October 13, 2020, the Court granted-in-part and denied-in-part the Company’s renewed motion to dismiss. On October 27, 2020, the Company filed its answer to Monterey’s complaint and also filed counterclaims based on Monterey’s breach of the parties’ pre-suit non-disclosure agreement. On December 1, 2020, Monterey filed a motion to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims. On January 5, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s motion to stay the litigation pending inter partes review of the patents-in-suit by the Patent Trial and Appeals Board. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System Litigation On September 29, 2020, the City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System, an AMD shareholder, filed a shareholder derivative complaint (the “Complaint”) against AMD and the members of its Board of Directors (collectively, “Defendants”) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. See City of Pontiac Police and Fire Retirement System v. Caldwell, et al., No. 5:20-cv-6794 (N.D. Cal.). The Complaint alleges that Defendants breached their fiduciary duties, violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and were unjustly enriched by misrepresenting the Company’s commitment to diversity, particularly with respect to the composition of the membership of AMD’s Board of Directors and senior leadership team. On December 18, 2020, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Complaint. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Xilinx Acquisition Litigation On October 26, 2020, the Company, its wholly owned subsidiary, Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., and Xilinx, Inc. (“Xilinx”) entered a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) in which the Company will acquire Xilinx by merging Thrones Merger Sub, Inc. with and into Xilinx, with Xilinx continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Proposed Transaction”). See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. On December 3, 2020, the Company and Xilinx filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (together with the joint proxy statement and prospectus contained therein, the “Registration Statement”) describing the Proposed Transaction and other related matters. On December 11, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a putative class action in the New York State Supreme Court, New York County, regarding the Proposed Transaction. Nunez v. Xilinx , Case No. 656971/2020 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). The lawsuit alleges that the Board of Directors of Xilinx breached their fiduciary duties to Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction 79 by allegedly failing to obtain fair, adequate and maximum consideration for Xilinx shareholders in connection with the Proposed Transaction and by not disclosing certain material information about the Proposed Transaction in the Registration Statement. The lawsuit asserts a single claim against the Company, alleging that it aided and abetted the Xilinx directors’ breach of their fiduciary duties. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 15, 2020, a Xilinx shareholder filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, regarding the Proposed Transaction. Shumacher v. Xilinx , Case No. 1:20-cv-10595 (S.D.N.Y.). The lawsuit alleges that Xilinx and its Board of Directors disseminated a false and misleading Registration Statement that omitted material information regarding the Proposed Transaction, thereby violating Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The lawsuit also asserts a single claim against the Company, alleging that it acted as a controlling person of Xilinx within the meaning of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act by virtue of its supervisory control over the composition of the Registration Statement. The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. On December 23, 2020, a shareholder of the Company filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York regarding the Proposed Transaction. Vazirani v.

The lawsuit seeks to enjoin or rescind any transaction with Xilinx as well as certain other equitable relief, unspecified damages and attorneys’ fees and costs. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Future Link Systems Litigation On December 21, 2020, Future Link Systems, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Future Link Systems alleges that the Company infringes three U.S. patents: 7,983,888 (related to simulated PCI express circuitry); 6,363,466 (related to out of order data transactions); and 6,622,108 (related to interconnect testing). Future Link Systems seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations . Environmental Matters The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $ 4 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range 80 of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. NOTE 18 – Pending Acquisition On October 26, 2020 , the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement),with Thrones Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), and Xilinx, Inc.(Xilinx), whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into Xilinx (the Merger), with Xilinx surviving such Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Under the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of common stock of Xilinx (Xilinx Common Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury shares and any shares of Xilinx Common Stock held directly by the Company or Merger Sub) will be converted into the right to receive 1.7234 fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Company and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, subject to any applicable withholding. As of the signing of the Merger Agreement, the transaction was valued at $ 35 billion. The actual valuation of the transaction could differ significantly from the estimated amount due to movements in the price of the Company’s common stock, the number of shares of Xilinx common stock outstanding on the closing date of the Merger and other factors . Under the Merger Agreement, the Company will be required to pay a termination fee to Xilinx equal to $ 1.5 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances, including if the Merger Agreement is terminated because the Company’s board of directors has changed its recommendation. The Company will be required to pay a termination fee equal to $ 1 billion if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances related to the failure to obtain required regulatory approvals prior to October 26, 2021 (subject to automatic extension first to January 26, 2022 and then to April 26, 2022, in each case, to the extent the regulatory closing conditions remain outstanding). The closing of the Merger is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by the stockholders of both the Company and Xilinx. The Merger is currently expected to close by the end of calendar year 2021. 81 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 29, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 82 Inventory Valuation Description of the Matter At December 26, 2020, the Company’s net inventory balance was $1,399 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand, by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on a number of factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In particular, in estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing above described assumptions and management’s judgments. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles and/or identified alternative customer uses. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments. Deferred Tax Asset Valuation Allowance Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 26, 2020, the Company carried deferred tax assets of $1,420 million, net of a $1,576 million valuation allowance. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management’s judgment it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Once established, the valuation allowance is released when, based on the weight of all available evidence, management concludes that related deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. In 2020, management concluded sufficient positive evidence exists to release a portion of the valuation allowance related to U.S. deferred tax assets, resulting in an income tax benefit of $1,301 million in 2020. Auditing management's analysis of the realizability of the deferred tax assets was complex and highly judgmental because the assessment process involves significant judgment and subjective evaluation of assumptions that may be affected by future operations of the Company, market or economic conditions. 83 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management’s evaluation of the nature of its tax attributes and projections of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income. We evaluated the Company's assessment of the realizability of its U.S. deferred tax assets and the resultant release of valuation allowance. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of the nature of the Company’s tax attributes, application of the technical tax guidance related to attributes subject to additional limitation, projections of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions used by the Company to assess reliability of its projected future taxable income. We compared the projections of future taxable income with the actual results of prior periods and assessed management's consideration of current industry and economic trends. We also compared the projections of future taxable income with other forecasted financial information prepared by the Company. Further, we tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s projections. We involved our tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to evaluate the Company’s assessment of the scheduling of the reversal of existing temporary taxable differences and carryforward amounts and the carryforward lives of its deferred tax assets, and whether the estimated future sources of taxable income were of the appropriate character to utilize the deferred tax assets in the relevant time period. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970. San Jose, California January 29, 2021 84 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 26, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 29, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California January 29, 2021 85 Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited) The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 26, 2020, the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the 87 Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 26, 2020 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, which is included in Part II, Item 8, above. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function. Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics Markets Central Processing Unit (CPU) . A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the “brain” of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 2 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set, memory size and data access speed. Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU. GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (e.g. virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)). In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining and autonomous driving). Accelerated Processing Unit (APU). Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements. An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for example, eliminating connections between discrete chips. System-on-Chip (SoC) . An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU. Chipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a device or a collection of devices that allow the microprocessor to connect to a wider range of peripheral devices in the system (such as storage, optical drives, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) peripherals). Chipsets can perform essential logic functions, and operate in concert with the microprocessor to manage system control and power management functions of all the devices in the system. Chipsets are most often found in larger form factor systems, typically desktop systems or larger notebook platforms, which require the expanded peripheral selection that is enabled by the chipset. Typical notebook platforms and small form factor desktop platforms typically do not utilize a chipset and instead rely on the capabilities of the APU to connect to all the required devices on the platform. Our Computing and Graphics Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and a chipset when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single point of contact for the 3 key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Infinity Fabric, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable fast data access and high performance. We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state. Desktop. In May 2019, we introduced the 3 rd Gen AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor family based on the new “Zen 2” core architecture with AMD chiplet design approach.

Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices. Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience, and, for these consumers, the PC has evolved from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to increasing creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for computing devices, including playing games, capturing media content, viewing online videos, editing photos and managing digital content. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD), that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market. In addition to traditional graphics markets, there is a large and growing market for accelerated computing, powered by graphics processors, which is primarily made up of high-performance computing and machine learning/deep learning. Traditional high performance computing focuses on scientific research, model simulation, and exploration which is mainly driven by a need for computing throughput in universities and government research centers. The second market is the rapidly growing area of machine learning and deep learning workloads. Graphics processors are used both in the training of machine learning models as well as the application of models via inference. The expansion of compute workloads on graphics processors is driving market expansion for traditional graphics silicon. Another area of the market for graphics compute is blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store, transmit and process sensitive and valuable data. Blockchain applications are typically performed using specifically designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general purpose CPU or GPU. Our Graphics Products Graphics processing is a fundamental component of almost everything we create and can be found in an APU, GPU, SoC or a combination of a discrete GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to enable or increase the speed of rendering images, to help improve image resolution and color definition, and increasingly to process massive data sets for cloud and data center applications. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices and entertainment platforms, including desktop PCs, notebook PCs, 2-in-1s, All-in-Ones (AIOs), professional workstations, and the data center. With each of our graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dGPUs) offer high performance graphics processing across all platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition, computing devices with heterogeneous computing features can run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user. Moreover, heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level as the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. Discrete Desktop and Notebook Graphics . Our discrete GPUs for desktop and notebook PCs support current generation application program interface (APIs) like DirectX® 12 and Vulkan®, support new displays using Radeon™ FreeSync™ and Radeon™ FreeSync 2 HDR™ technologies, and are designed to support VR in PC platforms.

Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Markets Server. A server is a computer system that performs services for connected customers as part of a client-server architecture. Many servers are designed to run an application or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal human intervention. Examples of servers include cloud, web, e-mail, print and on-premise servers. These servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort. Today’s data centers require new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed, analyzed and managed. Servers must be efficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads. Embedded . Embedded products address computing needs in casino gaming machines as well as enterprise-class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which are computers that serve as an access device on a network), and in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service kiosks, and medical imaging. Typically, AMD embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance, where key features may include relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Support for Linux ® , Windows ® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market. Semi-Custom . We have leveraged our core IP, including our graphics and processing technologies developed for the gaming, VR, AR and machine intelligence markets, to develop semi-custom solutions for customers who want differentiation in their products.

The AMD EPYC Embedded 3000 Series of processors addresses new markets including, networking, storage and edge computing devices. Semi-Custom . Our semi-custom products are tailored, co-developed, high-performance, customer-specific solutions based on AMD CPU, GPU and multi-media technologies. We work closely together with our customers to define solutions to precisely match the requirements of the device or application. Historically we have leveraged our core graphics processing technology into the game console market by licensing our graphic technology in game consoles. We developed the semi-custom SoC products that power the current generation Sony PlayStation® 4 and PlayStation ® 4 Pro and Microsoft ® Xbox One™ and Xbox One S™ and Xbox One X™ game consoles. In April 2019, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Inc. released details about its next-generation game console, which will be powered by a custom AMD chip based on the “Zen 2” CPU and next generation GPU architectures. Microsoft announced in June 2019, that AMD will power its next generation game console, codenamed Project Scarlett, with a custom, high performance SoC combining the AMD Ryzen “Zen 2” CPU core 4 and a next generation GPU based on the Radeon RDNA gaming architecture. Marketing and Sales We sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent distributors and sales representatives in both domestic and international markets. Our sales arrangements generally operate on the basis of product forecasts provided by the particular customer, but do not typically include any commitment or requirement for minimum product purchases. We primarily use purchase orders, sales order acknowledgments and contractual agreements as evidence of our sales arrangements. Our agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as payment terms, warranties and indemnities for issues specific to our products. We generally warrant that our products sold to our customers will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. We offer up to three-year limited warranties for certain product types, and sometimes provide other warranty periods based on negotiated terms with certain customers. We market and sell our latest products under the AMD trademark. Our desktop PC product brands for microprocessors are AMD Ryzen™, AMD Ryzen™ PRO, Ryzen™ Threadripper™, AMD A-Series, AMD FX™, AMD Athlon™, AMD Athlon™ PRO, and AMD Pro A-Series processors. Our notebook and 2-in-1s for microprocessors are AMD Ryzen™ processors with Radeon™ Vega Graphics, AMD A-Series, AMD Athlon, AMD Ryzen PRO with Radeon Vega Graphics, AMD Athlon™ PRO with Radeon Vega Graphics and AMD Pro A-Series processors. Our server brands for microprocessors are AMD EPYC™ and AMD Opteron™ processors. We also sell low-power versions of our AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon, as well as AMD Geode™, AMD Ryzen, AMD EPYC, AMD R-Series and G-Series processors as embedded processor solutions. Our product brand for the consumer graphics market is AMD Radeon graphics, and AMD Embedded Radeon 7 graphics is our product brand for the embedded graphics market. Our product brand for professional graphics products are AMD Radeon Pro AMD FirePro™ graphics; our product brand for data center graphics is Radeon Instinct™ accelerators for servers. We also market and sell our chipsets under AMD trademarks. We market our products through direct marketing and co-marketing programs. In addition, we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers and third parties, including market development programs, pursuant to which we may provide product information, training, marketing materials and funds. Under our co-marketing development programs, eligible customers can use market development funds as reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party systems integrating our products, subject to meeting defined criteria. Customers Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), large direct data centers, original design manufacturers (ODMs), system integrators and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Customers of our microprocessor products also include online retailers. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs). Large direct data centers consist of cloud service providers. Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. We work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. We also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Certain customers pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting products. Our major customer, Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 28, 2019 . Sales to Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. A loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our business. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEM partners: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and some local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM partners. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles. Third-Party Distributors Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, and may include those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. 8 Competition in the Microprocessor and Chipset Market Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, which can make them less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, can become distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners that require or result in exclusive product arrangements; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers and retailers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including tablets and thin-client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM cores and architecture to third parties, including us, and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. Competition in the Graphics Markets In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel is developing its own high-end discrete GPUs for both consumer and commercial applications. Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. 9 In the data center, our principal competitor is Nvidia as the adoption of their proprietary CUDA software platform established their market share in high performance computing and machine learning. Other competitors include numerous deep learning accelerator companies, consisting mostly of early to late stage start-ups. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, and where we compete primarily against Nvidia. Competition in the Server Markets In the server market, we compete against Intel with our CPU server products and Nvidia with our GPU server products. Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada, China, India, Taiwan and Singapore who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters. Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc . We are a party to a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF), which governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU products, from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nm, with limited exceptions. GF was a related party to us until May 15, 2019. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of wafers for certain products. Other Third-Party Manufacturers . We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers. Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities Wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our assembly, test, mark and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the ATMP JVs. Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 28, 2019 , we had approximately 4,000 patents in the United States and approximately 900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 9,900 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 7,200 issued patents and 2,800 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009. Under the cross-license 10 agreement, we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all of each other’s patents that were first filed no later than November 11, 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the cross-license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross-license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross-license agreement or the rights and licenses of the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross-license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross-license agreement. The cross-license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross-license agreement), and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross-license agreement, and in the event that the cross-license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross-license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate. Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products, our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter. Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Employees As of December 28, 2019 , we had approximately 11,400 employees. Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. 11 Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 12 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously. Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; product mix and introduction schedules; product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer OEM customers and retailers. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to 13 allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JVs) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the ATMP JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7 nanometer (nm) product portfolio on Taiwan Semiconductor Co., Ltd.’s (TSMC) 7nm process. If TSMC is not able to manufacture our 7nm products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen™, AMD Radeon™ and AMD EPYC™ processors using 7nm+ process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our 14 products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. Our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project, and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customer’s products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our 15 operating results may be adversely affected. Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers’ potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in the United States, Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 74% for the year ended December 28, 2019. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: expropriation; changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; changes in freight and interest rates; disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, the United Kingdom’s 2016 referendum, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” has created economic and political uncertainty in the European Union. Also, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. Government actions and regulations such as export administration regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures, may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. We have a joint venture with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). In June 2019, the United States Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. In October 2019, the BIS added additional Chinese entities to the Entity List. Also, the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. Specifically, United States-China trade relations remain uncertain. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and China has imposed tariffs in response to the actions of the United States. We are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export regulations or other restrictions imposed on our products or on our customers by the United States, China or other 16 countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariffs, trade protection measures or restrictions could result in lost sales adversely impacting our reputation and business. Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. The products that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers, vendors and end users, to deploy our mitigations or create their own, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We also are subject to claims and litigation related to Spectre side-channel exploits and may face additional claims or litigation for future vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners’ and third-party providers’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. Maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, business and system disruption attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. The confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information. We anticipate ongoing and increasing costs related to: enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; mitigating reputational harm; and compliance with external regulations, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results. 17 We have a wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and accelerated processing unit (APU) product requirements and a certain portion of our graphics processing unit (GPU) product requirements manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer from GF, with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted. The wafer supply agreement (WSA) governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF and is in place until 2024. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected. Under the terms of the WSA, we have agreed to minimum annual wafer purchase targets through 2021. If we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. In addition, GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis, or at all, and if GF is not otherwise able to adequately fund its operations, GF’s ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Facility impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indenture governing our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; create or permit certain liens; create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; use the proceeds from sales of assets; enter 18 into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Secured Revolving Facility’s credit agreement (Credit Agreement) restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that (i) on the date of such payment, an event of default exists under the Credit Agreement or would result therefrom or (ii) if we would have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, a consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds 3.50x. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If under certain circumstances we fail to make a cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, could constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. Our Secured Revolving Facility also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and liens, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities, make certain dispositions, create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date and enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (in each case, except for certain customary exceptions). The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Facility contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other indebtedness. For example, the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of (i) $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), and (ii) $100 million would cause a cross default under the Secured Revolving Facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Facility to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 7.50% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products comparatively less competitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel has announced that it plans to expand its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Also, the semiconductor industry has seen several mergers and acquisitions over the last number of years. Further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer suppliers, customers and partners in the industry. 19 The conversion of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The 2.125% Notes will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of the end of December 31, 2019 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2020. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2.125% Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% Notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have in the past experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation®4, Sony PlayStation®4 Pro, Microsoft® Xbox One™ S and Microsoft® Xbox One™ X game console systems worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China and South Korea have instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g. BIOS, operating systems, drivers), memory and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our add-in-board (AIB) partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software, memory and other components cease or reduce their design, manufacture or production of current or future products that are based on or support our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use 20 with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB partner or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as intangible assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge in Cost of sales of $45 million on technology licenses related to products that were no longer being used. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service our executives of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive employees. Competition for highly skilled executives and employees in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted individuals in our organization that have desired skills and experience. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employees necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate our executives and qualified employees, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate our executives and employees could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executives and employees and affect our ability to retain our personnel. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt principal amount as of December 28, 2019 was $0.6 billion. Our indebtedness may make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; limit our ability to use 21 our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving credit facility for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Facility), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Facility or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured Revolving Facility, which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Facility. Upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Facility. As of December 28, 2019, $0.6 billion principal amount was outstanding under our notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Facility. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: substantial declines in average selling prices; the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments could disrupt our business and/or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through joint ventures or investments rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint 22 ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs, and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives such as the THATIC JV. We may not realize the expected benefits from the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, the receipt of any future milestone payments and royalties from certain licensed intellectual property. In June 2019, the United States Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security added certain Chinese entities to the Entity List, including THATIC and the THATIC JV. We are complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We may purchase equipment and materials for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are 23 currently available from only a limited number of sources. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, data center operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. 24 Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impacts our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. 25 We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, as described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims, including those described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, including the claims described in Note 18 of our consolidated financial statements, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. We are subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Act) contains many significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, which the consequences of could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and could increase our future U.S. income tax expense. As additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities and as new accounting treatment is clarified, we may report additional adjustments in the period if new information becomes available. We have a significant amount of deferred tax assets and a portion of the deferred tax assets related to net operating losses or tax credits could be subject to limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 or 383, separate return loss year rules, or dual consolidated loss rules. The limitations could reduce the ability of the Company to be able to utilize the net operating losses or tax credits before the expiration of the tax attributes. Tax law changes or the limitations could be material and could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. 26 If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. The United States federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. Germany’s federal procurement office, in collaboration with the Bitkom trade association, issued new supply chain labor requirements. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers as well as the Responsible Business Alliance have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 28, 2019 , we leased approximately 2.35 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Santa Clara, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our design center in Shanghai, China, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, 27 principally in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. We occupy 220,000 square feet of space in our headquarters in Santa Clara, California under a 10-year operating lease which commenced in August 2017 and expires in July 2027. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5-year periods. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The leases for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expire in February 2028, and provide for one 5-year optional renewals. We occupy approximately 265,000 square feet of space in our design center in Shanghai, China under a 10-year operating lease, which expires in March 2028. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual directors and officers regarding our 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on our 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against us and certain of our officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding our 32nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of our insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On January 30, 2018, the Wessels and Hamilton plaintiffs amended their complaints. On February 2, 2018, the Ha plaintiff also filed an amended complaint. On February 22, 2018, we filed motions to dismiss the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs’ amended complaints. On April 2, 2018, we filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the Wessels amended complaint. On July 23, 2018, the Santa Clara Superior Court sustained our demurrer in the Wessels case, dismissing all claims in that matter with prejudice. The Wessels plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints. The Hamilton plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 8, 2018, and the Ha plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary reversal of the order dismissing their claims. We opposed this motion on December 13, 2018, and the Court denied it on February 25, 2019. The Wessels, Hamilton, and Ha appeals are currently pending. Briefing has completed in each appeal. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Hauck et al. Litigation Since January 19, 2018, three putative class action complaints have been filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: (1) Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc., Case No. 5:18-cv-0047, filed on January 19, 2018; (2) Brian Speck et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-0744, filed on February 4, 2018; and (3) Nathan Barnes and Jonathan Caskey-Medina, et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-00883, filed on February 9, 2018. On April 9, 2018, the court consolidated 28 these cases and ordered that Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc. serve as the lead case. On June 13, 2018, six plaintiffs (from California, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts) filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that we failed to disclose our processors’ alleged vulnerability to Spectre. Plaintiffs further allege that our processors cannot perform at their advertised processing speeds without exposing consumers to Spectre, and that any “patches” to remedy this security vulnerability will result in degradation of processor performance. The plaintiffs seek damages under several causes of action on behalf of a nationwide class and four state subclasses (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana) of consumers who purchased our processors and/or devices containing AMD processors. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees, equitable relief, and restitution. Pursuant to the court’s order directing the parties to litigate only eight of the causes of action in the consolidated amended complaint initially, we filed a motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018. On October 29, 2018, after the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed one of their claims, the court granted our motion and dismissed six causes of action with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint on December 6, 2018. On January 3, 2019, we again moved to dismiss the subset of claims currently at issue. On April 4, 2019, the court granted our motion and dismissed all claims currently at issue with prejudice. On May 6, 2019, the court granted the parties’ stipulation and request under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) to enter a partial final judgment and certify for appeal the court’s April 4, 2019 dismissal order, and on that same date, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their remaining claims pursuant to an agreement whereby, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to toll the statute of limitations and/or statute of repose. On May 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing has completed for the appeal. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that we infringe two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that we infringe one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that we infringe two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against us; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, we filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. On July 22, 2019, our motion to dismiss in the Polaris case was denied. On August 23, 2019, the Court held a claim construction hearing in each case. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD , No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that we misled consumers by using the term “eight cores” in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on our “Bulldozer” core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees. On December 21, 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon our motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. On March 27, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. On January 17, 2019, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The class definition does not encompass our Ryzen or EPYC processors. On January 31, 2019, we filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of certain aspects of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. On May 9, 2019, the parties attended mediation and reached a tentative settlement. On June 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied our petition seeking appellate review of the January 17, 2019, class certification order. On August 9, 2019, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement. On August 23, 2019, plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. On October 4, 2019, the Court granted the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. 29 Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Monterey Research Litigation On November 15, 2019, Monterey Research, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against us in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Monterey Research alleges that we infringe six U.S. patents: 6,534,805 (related to SRAM cell design); 6,629,226 (related to read interface protocols); 6,651,134 (related to memory devices); 6,765,407 (related to programmable digital circuits); 6,961,807 (related to integrated circuits and associated memory systems); and 8,373,455 (related to output buffer circuits). Monterey Research seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against us. On January 22, 2020, we filed a motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on our management’s current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

(3) In 2016, we recorded a charge of $340 million in Cost of sales, consisting of the $240 million value of the warrant under a warrant agreement and the $100 million payment, which were both associated with the sixth amendment to the WSA. In addition, we recorded a cumulative pre-tax gain of $146 million on the sale of our 85% equity interest in the ATMP JV. (4) In 2015, we implemented restructuring plans and incurred net charges of $53 million, which primarily consisted of severance and related employee benefits. In addition, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly Sea Micro, Inc., resulting in a charge of $76 million in restructuring and other special charges, net. Also, we recorded an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs, and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. (5) In 2019, we reduced our long-term debt, net and other long term liabilities by $663 million, primarily due to $628 million of net debt conversion and repayment. In 2016, we reduced our long-term debt, net and other long term liabilities by $534 million, primarily due to $1,048 million of net debt repayment, partially offset by the issuance of $805 million in principal amount of 2.125% Notes net of unamortized discount of $308 million and unamortized issuance cost of $14 million. 33 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction In this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “our” or “AMD”), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2019 compared to 2018 , an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 . Overview 2019 marked a milestone in our multi-year journey with the launch of our 7 nanometer (nm) product portfolio. We executed our product roadmap and introduced a number of high-performance products in 2019. For the PC market, we introduced the 3rd Gen AMD Ryzen™ desktop processor family based on the new Zen 2 core architecture with AMD chiplet design approach. In addition to our mainstream PC product family, we introduced the next generation of the Ryzen™ Threadripper™ product line designed for the high-end desktop segment for creators and enthusiasts. We announced our second-generation AMD Ryzen™ 3000 Series notebook processors, powering ultrathin, commercial and gaming notebooks. A number of high-performance graphics products were also launched in 2019. We introduced the AMD Radeon™ VII, a premium graphics card for gamers, creators and enthusiasts. We also announced the availability of the AMD Radeon™ RX 5700-series gaming graphics card family, the AMD Radeon™ RX 5500 series that will be available in desktop PCs from major PC manufacturers as well as the Radeon™ 5500M GPU for notebook PCs. Our AMD Radeon™ Pro Vega II GPU is designed to power demanding professional applications. We also announced the AMD Radeon™ Pro W5700, a 7nm professional PC workstation graphics card that enables 3D professionals to visualize and interact with their designs in real time. For the server market, we introduced the 2nd Gen AMD EPYC™ family of processors that feature up to 64 “Zen 2” cores in 7nm process technology for performance and are designed to reduce total cost of ownership (TOC) by up to 50%. Net revenue for 2019 was $6.7 billion , an increase of 4% compared to 2018 net revenue of $6.5 billion . Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2019, was 43% , compared to 38% in 2018. Our operating income for 2019 improved to $631 million compared to operating income of $451 million for 2018. Our net income for 2019 improved to $341 million compared to $337 million in the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 28, 2019 were $ 1.5 billion , up from $1.2 billion at the end of 2018. We made significant progress towards improving our balance sheet in 2019 as we reduced our debt. Principal amount of total debt as of December 28, 2019 was $563 million , compared to $ 1.5 billion as of December 29, 2018. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. 34 Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue recognition. We recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). Accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our actual cost or estimated net realizable value. Among other factors, management considers recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand, estimates of future selling prices, competitiveness of product offerings, market and industry conditions, customer requirements and product life cycles when determining excess, obsolescence and net realizable value in relation to the inventory on hand. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. We first analyze qualitative factors. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income Taxes . In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. 35 We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. Unless recovery is considered more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%), we will record a charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable or maintain the valuation allowance recorded in prior periods. In determining the need to establish or maintain a valuation allowance, we consider multiple factors including past performance, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and future expected taxable income. When considering all available evidence, if it is determined we can more-likely-than-not realize our deferred tax assets, we will reverse the existing valuation allowance, which would result in a credit to income tax expense and the establishment of an asset in the period of reversal. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Results of Operations We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments: the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 15: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, our net revenue has been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, although market conditions and product transitions could impact these trends. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 4,709 $ 4,125 $ 2,977 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 2,022 2,350 2,276 Total net revenue $ 6,731 $ 6,475 $ 5,253 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 577 $ 470 $ 92 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 263 163 132 All Other (209 ) (182 ) (97 ) Total operating income $ 631 $ 451 $ 127 Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $4.7 billion in 2019 increased by 14% , compared to $4.1 billion in 2018 , primarily as a result of a 22% increase in average selling price and a 4% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price was primarily driven by a richer mix of client processors due to strong demand of our Ryzen processors. The increase in unit shipments was primarily due to higher demand for our Ryzen processors, partially offset by lower demand for our Radeon graphics products. Computing and Graphics operating income was $577 million in 2019 compared to operating income of $470 million in 2018 . The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher sales, partially offset by a $194 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.0 billion in 2019 decreased by 14% compared to net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018 , primarily as a result of lower semi-custom product revenue, partially offset by higher sales of our EPYC server processors. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $263 million in 2019 compared to operating income of $163 million in 2018 . The increase in operating income was due primarily to higher sales of our EPYC server processor and a licensing 36 gain of $60 million recognized in the first quarter of 2019, partially offset by lower semi-custom product revenue and a $37 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons outlined under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other operating loss of $209 million in 2019 included $197 million of stock-based compensation expense and a $12 million contingent loss accrual on a legal matter. All Other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included $137 million of stock-based compensation expense and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million . Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Licensing Gain, Interest Expense, Other Expense and Income Taxes The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : 2019 2018 2017 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 3,863 $ 4,028 $ 3,466 Gross profit 2,868 2,447 1,787 Gross margin percentage 43 % 38 % 34 % Research and development 1,547 1,434 1,196 Marketing, general and administrative 750 562 516 Licensing gain (60 ) — (52 ) Interest expense (94 ) (121 ) (126 ) Other expense, net (165 ) — (9 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 31 (9 ) 18 Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 43% in 2019 compared to 38% in 2018 . The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors, which have a higher gross margin than the corporate average. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.5 billion in 2019 increased by $113 million , or 8% , compared to $1.4 billion in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in product development costs in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $750 million in 2019 increased by $188 million , or 33% , compared to $562 million in 2018 . The increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activities in both the Computing and Graphics and Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segments, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense. Licensing Gain During 2019 , we recognized $60 million as licensing gain associated with the licensed IP to THATIC JV. See Note 4 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information. Interest Expense Interest expense of $94 million in 2019 decreased by $27 million compared to $121 million in 2018 , primarily due to lower debt balances. Other Expense, Net Other expense , net increased in 2019 by $165 million from net of zero in 2018 . The change from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to $176 million of loss on redemption, repurchases and conversions of debt in 2019. 37 Provision For (Benefit From) Income Taxes We recorded an income tax provision of $31 million in 2019 and income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018. The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $22 million of withholding taxes related to cross-border transactions and $22 million of foreign income taxes in profitable locations partially offset by a $13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year. The income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. As we continue to make progress in our business resulting in improved financial results, our future reassessment could possibly result in a determination that a valuation allowance is no longer required. The impact of the determination would result in the release of the valuation allowance and significant financial impact in a future reporting period with a material non-cash income tax benefit and the recording of additional deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet. International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2019 and 80% in 2018 . We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 28, 2019 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.5 billion compared to $1.2 billion as of December 29, 2018 . The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 90% as of December 28, 2019 , and 88% as of December 29, 2018 . Our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 493 $ 34 $ 12 Investing activities (149 ) (170 ) (54 ) Financing activities 43 28 (33 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ 387 $ (108 ) $ (75 ) Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $0.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Facility entered into in June 2019 (refer to Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information) will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $493 million in 2019 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $34 million in 2018 . The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections, partially offset by timing of accounts payable payments and higher wafer purchases and payroll. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $149 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of $217 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by a net cash inflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $41 million. 38 Net cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment and a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities of $78 million. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $43 million in 2019, which primarily consisted of a cash inflow of $449 million from the warrant exercised by West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) and $74 million from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by $473 million of cash used for debt reduction activities during the year. Net cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $70 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $41 million of cash used for debt reduction activities in 2018. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 28, 2019 , and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter Term debt $ 563 $ — $ — $ 312 $ — $ — $ 251 Aggregate interest obligation (1) 102 30 30 21 6 6 9 Other long-term liabilities (2) 155 54 50 48 1 — 2 Operating leases 287 54 48 44 37 33 71 Purchase obligations (3) 2,290 1,677 592 10 4 2 5 Total contractual obligations (4) $ 3,397 $ 1,815 $ 720 $ 435 $ 48 $ 41 $ 338 (1) Represents interest obligations, payable in cash, for our outstanding debt. (2) Amounts primarily represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months. (3) Represents purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses. The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Term Debt 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012, we issued $500 million of the 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes). The 7.50% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year beginning February 15, 2013 until the maturity date of August 15, 2022. The 7.50% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 7.50% Indenture) dated August 15, 2012 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. In 2014, we repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in open market transactions for $24 million . In 2016, we repurchased $125 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes pursuant to a partial tender offer for $135 million . In 2017, we settled $3 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in treasury stock. In 2018 , we settled $10 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in treasury stock at a weighted-average cost of $9.01 per share. During 2019 , we repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes in cash. As of December 28, 2019 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.50% Notes was $312 million . 39 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, we issued $805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes). The 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017. The 2.125% Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.125% Notes, holders of the 2.125% Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock at our election. The event described in (1) above was met during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 and, as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2020 and remain convertible until March 31, 2020. During 2019, we converted $554 million principal amount of the 2.125% Notes through the issuance of approximately 69 million shares of our common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $56 million. As of December 28, 2019 , we had $251 million principal of 2.125% Notes outstanding. See Note 7 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes and 2.125% Notes. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. In addition, we lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of December 28, 2019 were $287 million , including future lease payments related to leases in Santa Clara, California; Austin, Texas; Markham, Canada and Shanghai, China. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 28, 2019 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 40 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 28, 2019 , our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 28, 2019 , all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 28, 2019 , substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. The following table presents certain information for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 28, 2019 : 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and thereafter Total (1) 2019 Fair Value (2) (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Variable rate amounts $ 1,425 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,425 $ 1,425 Weighted-average rate 1.83 % — % — % — % — % — % 1.83 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 37 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 37 $ 37 Weighted-average rate 2.13 % — % — % — % — % — % 2.13 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 1,462 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,462 $ 1,462 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ — $ — $ 312 $ — $ — $ 251 $ 563 $ 1,823 Weighted-average effective interest rate — % — % 7.50 % — % — % 2.125 % 5.10 % Total Debt Obligations $ — $ — $ 312 $ — $ — $ 251 $ 563 $ 1,823 (1) The dollar amounts represent the cost basis of our investment portfolio and the remaining principal of our debt obligations. (2) Our 2.125% Notes, included in debt obligations above, were convertible at the option of the holder as of December 28, 2019. The estimated fair value of the 2.125% Notes takes into account the value of our stock price of $46.18 as of December 28, 2019 and the initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock. Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective, the gain or loss on these contracts is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and 41 reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 . All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements NOTE 1: The Company Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. NOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year . The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 each consisted of 52 weeks. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Reclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Basis of Presentation . Effective in the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to adjust prior reporting periods presented. The 2017 amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements were previously adjusted in the Company’s 2018 Form 10-K to reflect the retrospective application. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Nature of products and services The Company’s microprocessors (CPUs), chipsets, graphics processing unites (GPUs), data center and professional graphics products, accelerated processing units (APUs), server and embedded processors, and System-on-Chip (SoC) products may be sold as standard non-custom products, or custom products manufactured to customers’ specifications. The Company also provides development services and licenses portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio. Non-custom products: The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume-based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Custom products: Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), sold under non-cancellable purchases orders and which have no alternative use to the Company 49 at contract inception, are recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements: From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the IP. These arrangements are deemed to be single or multiple performance obligations based upon the nature of the arrangements. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control, over time or at a point-in time, depending on the nature of the arrangements. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Inventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or estimated net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about anticipated or forecasted demand, estimates of future selling prices, competitiveness of product offerings, market and industry conditions, customer requirements and product life cycles. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required . Goodwill. The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company first analyzes qualitative factors. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables presented net of rebates, price protection and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of amounts owed by customers. The allowance consists of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience. 50 Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities . The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale debt securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other expense, net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The Company classifies investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheets. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration some of the Company’s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying its strategy, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted revenue and expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. To the extent such hedges are effective, the Company records the gain or loss on these contracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and it reclassifies such gains or losses to earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Such amounts are included in the same line item in earnings as the associated forecasted transaction. The Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in Other expense, net. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. When the Company determines the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, it then determines whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable or when the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is not a commonly quoted rate and is derived through a combination of inputs including the Company’s credit rating and the impact of full collateralization. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term of the lease payments. The Company utilizes the consolidated group incremental borrowing rate for all leases as the Company has centralized treasury operations. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company believes it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As allowed by the guidance, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s finance leases are immaterial. Product Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year . The Company may also offer one to three -year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense 51 transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Marketing and Advertising Expenses. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. In addition, the Company’s marketing and advertising expenses include certain cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Total marketing and advertising expenses for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were approximately $ 217 million , $ 176 million and $ 156 million , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation . The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For time-based restricted stock units, fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to PRSUs, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes. The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Leases. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for lease recognition and disclosure. This standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statements in a manner similar to legacy guidance. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the optional modified retrospective approach, which did not require an adjustment to comparative period financial statements, and recorded $ 228 million of right-of-use assets and $ 261 million of lease liabilities primarily related to office buildings on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2018. The Company’s accounting for capital leases, now referred to as finance leases, remains unchanged. The adoption of the new standard had no impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations or on net cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on its consolidated statement of cash flows. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company elected a transition practical expedient under the new accounting standard allowing it not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and non-lease component as a single lease component. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, using a modified retrospective adoption method. The Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 52 Income Taxes. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance in Topic 740 related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill and allocating consolidated income taxes to separate financial statements of entities not subject to income tax. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Company must apply certain aspects of this standard retrospectively for all periods presented while other aspects are applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations did not include amounts which have an original expected duration of less than one year. NOTE 4: Equity Joint Ventures ATMP Joint Venture s The Company holds a 15 % equity interest in two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV) with Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd, a Chinese joint stock company, and as such, the ATMP JV is a related party of the Company. The Company has no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. The Company accounts for its equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to its significant influence over the ATMP JV. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to the Company. The Company assists the ATMP JV in its management of certain raw material inventory. The purchases from and resales to the ATMP JV of inventory under 54 inventory management is reported within purchases and resales with the ATMP JV and does not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company’s total purchases from the ATMP JV during 2019 and 2018 amounted to $ 660 million and $ 574 million , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the amount payable to the ATMP JV was $ 213 million and $ 207 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

THATIC Joint Ventures In February 2016, the Company and Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). The Company’s equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by the Company’s contribution of certain of its patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV’s operations. The Company has no obligations to fund the THATIC JV. The Company does not consolidate either of these entities and accounts for its investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The THATIC JV is a related party of the Company. The Company’s share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for 2019 is not recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations since the Company is not obligated to fund the THATIC JV’s losses in excess of the Company’s investment in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of December 28, 2019 . In February 2016, the Company licensed certain of its intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of $ 293 million in license fees payable over several years upon achievement of certain milestones. The Company also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. The Company classifies Licensed IP income and royalty income, associated with the February 2016 agreement, as licensing gain within operating income. In March 2017, the Company entered into a development and intellectual property agreement (Development and IP) with the THATIC JV, and also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. The Company classifies Development and IP income and royalty income, associated with the March 2017 agreement, as revenue once earned. In addition, from time to time, the Company enters into certain agreements with the THATIC JV to provide other services primarily related to research and development. During 2019 and 2017 , the Company recognized $ 60 million and $ 52 million as licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP. During 2018 , the Company recognized $ 86 million of IP-related revenue upon completion of all technology milestones under the Development and IP agreement.

The Company is complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation. NOTE 5: GLOBALFOUNDRIES In March 2009, the Company and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) under which the Company would purchase wafers from GF. The WSA, which has been amended from time to time, governs the terms 55 by which the Company purchases products manufactured by GF through March 1, 2024. Pursuant to the WSA and its amendments, the Company is required to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. Under the terms of the WSA, the Company has minimum annual wafer purchase targets through 2021. If the Company fails to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year, it will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. The Company also agreed to continue to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. On August 30, 2016, in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the WSA Sixth Amendment, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala). Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns were entitled to purchase 75 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $ 5.98 per share. On February 13, 2019, WCH exercised its warrant to purchase 75 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $ 5.98 per share for a total amount of $ 449 million . Through May 15, 2019, GF was a related party of the Company because Mubadala and Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech, a party to the WSA) were affiliated with WCH, and a director of the Company’s Board of Directors (the Board) was associated with Mubadala. GF, WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. Effective May 15, 2019, the director of the Board associated with Mubadala retired from the Board, and as a result, GF was no longer considered a related party of the Company. All prior period related party classifications on the financial statements for GF have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company’s total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for 2019 (through May 15, 2019), 2018 and 2017 were $ 0.5 billion , $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.1 billion , respectively. Included in the total purchases were amounts related to the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry, as agreed by the Company and GF. As of December 29, 2018, the amount of prepayment and receivables related to GF was $ 18 million and the amount of payable to GF was $ 326 million . NOTE 6: Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill as of both December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 was $ 289 million , which was fully allocated to reporting units within the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.

NOTE 7: Debt, Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Revolving Line of Credit Debt The Company’s total debt as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 consisted of: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) 6.75% Notes $ — $ 66 7.50% Notes 312 337 7.00% Notes — 250 2.125% Notes 251 805 Secured Revolving Line of Credit — 70 Total debt (principal amount) $ 563 $ 1,528 Unamortized debt discount associated with 2.125% Notes ( 73 ) ( 262 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 4 ) ( 16 ) Total debt (net) $ 486 1,250 Less: current portion — ( 136 ) Total debt, less current portion $ 486 $ 1,114 56 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, the Company issued $ 805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes). The 2.125 % Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017. The 2.125 % Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.125 % Notes, holders of the 2.125 % Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 % of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $ 8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 % of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The event described in (1) above was met during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 and, as a result, the 2.125 % Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2020 and remain convertible until March 31, 2020. During 2019, the Company converted $ 554 million principal amount of its 2.125 % Notes through the issuance of approximately 69 million shares of the Company’s common stock at the conversion price of $ 8.00 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $ 56 million . As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 251 million principal of its 2.125 % Notes outstanding. The Company’s current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125 % Notes. As such, no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125 % Notes and the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125 % Notes as permanent equity on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 28, 2019 . The determination of whether or not the 2.125 % Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis. The 2.125 % Notes consisted of the following: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Principal $ 251 $ 805 Unamortized debt discount (1) ( 73 ) ( 262 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs ( 3 ) ( 11 ) Net carrying amount $ 175 $ 532 Carrying amount of the equity component, net (2) $ 95 $ 305 (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Long-term debt, net and amortized over the remaining life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of $ 3 million in equity issuance costs. As of December 28, 2019 , the remaining life of the 2.125 % Notes was approximately 81 months. Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $ 46.18 on December 27, 2019, the last trading day of 2019, the if-converted value of the 2.125 % Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $ 1.2 billion . 57 The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125 % Notes is 8 % . This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125 % Notes for the year ended December 28, 2019 : December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Contractual interest expense $ 15 $ 17 Interest cost related to amortization of debt issuance costs $ 1 $ 1 Interest cost related to amortization of the debt discount $ 22 $ 24 6.75 % Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014 , the Company issued $ 600 million of its 6.75 % Senior Notes due 2019 ( 6.75 % Notes).

The Company’s available borrowings under the Secured Revolving Facility are also subject to reduction by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of (i) any debt issuances not permitted by the Secured Revolving Facility and (ii) any non-ordinary course asset sales, in excess of $ 250 million , if such net cash proceeds are not reinvested by the Company within twelve months of receipt. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon, at the Company’s option, either the LIBOR rate or the base rate (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans ranges, based on an applicable total leverage ratio, from 1.00 % to 1.75 % per annum, and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum. The Company is required to pay fees on the undrawn portion available under the Secured Revolving Facility and in respect of outstanding letters of credit. In the event the LIBOR rate is not available, the agreement allows the Company to use the base rate. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a total leverage covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of 4.00 :1.00 and an interest coverage covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense of 3.00 :1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, which if they occur, could result in the termination of commitments under the Secured Revolving Facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are immediately due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement to maintain cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. As of December 28, 2019 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 28, 2019 . As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Secured Revolving Line of Credit On June 7, 2019, in connection with entering into the Credit Agreement as described above, the Company repaid its outstanding loan balance of $ 70 million under the secured revolving line of credit (Secured Revolving Line of Credit) and terminated the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of April 14, 2015, as amended, among the Company, a group of 59 lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., acting as agent for the lenders. Future Payments on Total Debt As of December 28, 2019 , the Company’s future debt payment obligations for the respective fiscal years were as follows: Term Debt (Principal only) (In millions) 2020 $ — 2021 — 2022 312 2023 — 2024 — 2025 and thereafter 251 Total $ 563 NOTE 8: Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which approximates amortized cost, as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are summarized below: Total Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions) December 28, 2019 Cash $ 1,465 $ 1,465 $ — Level 1 (1) Government money market funds $ 1 $ 1 $ — Total level 1 $ 1 $ 1 $ — Level 2 (2) Commercial paper $ 37 $ — $ 37 Total level 2 $ 37 $ — $ 37 Total $ 1,503 $ 1,466 $ 37 60 Total Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions) December 29, 2018 Cash $ 315 $ 315 $ — Level 1 (1) Government money market funds $ 275 $ 275 $ — Total level 1 $ 275 $ 275 $ — Level 2 (2) Commercial paper $ 566 $ 488 $ 78 Total level 2 $ 566 $ 488 $ 78 Total $ 1,156 $ 1,078 $ 78 (1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. (2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices for identical or comparable instruments in markets that are not active or comparable instruments in active markets. In addition to those amounts presented above, as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the Company had approximately $ 4 million and $ 5 million , respectively, of investments in money market funds, used as collateral for letters of credit deposits, which were included in Other current assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the Company also had approximately $ 30 million and $ 21 million , respectively, of investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Company’s deferred compensation plan, which were included in Other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These government money market funds and mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The Company carries its certain financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its debt. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are as follows: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (In millions) Short-term debt $ — $ — $ 136 $ 136 Long-term debt, net (1) $ 486 $ 1,823 $ 1,114 $ 2,428 (1) Carrying amounts of long-term debt are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 4 million and $ 16 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively, and net of $ 73 million and $ 262 million unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125 % Notes as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. The carrying amounts above do not include the equity component related to the conversion feature of the 2.125 % Notes of $ 95 million and $ 305 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. The estimated fair value of the Company’s short-term and long-term debt are based on Level 2 inputs. The Company’s 2.125 % Notes, included in Long-term debt, net, above, were convertible at the option of the holder as of December 28, 2019 . The estimated fair value of the 2.125 % Notes takes into account the value of the Company’s stock price of $ 46.18 as of December 28, 2019 and the initial conversion price of approximately $ 8.00 per share of common stock. The fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing payment terms. 61 Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts not Designated as Hedges The following table shows the amount of losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), the amount of losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and included in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges and the amount of losses included in other expense, net, related to contracts not designated as hedging instruments which was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Cost of sales Research and development Marketing, general and administrative Other expense, net Research and development Marketing, general and administrative Other expense, net (In millions) Contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments Losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4 ) $ ( 1 ) $ — $ ( 4 ) $ ( 1 ) $ — Contracts not designated as hedging instruments Losses recognized in earnings — — — ( 1 ) — — ( 3 ) Total losses $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 3 ) The Company’s foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets such as currency spot and forward rates. The following table shows the fair value amounts of the Company’s foreign currency derivative contracts depending on whether the foreign currency forward contracts were a gain or loss position. These amounts were recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets in either Other current assets or Other current liabilities. December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - gains (losses) Contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments - gains $ 2 $ 1 Contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments - losses $ ( 2 ) $ ( 8 ) For the foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portions of the hedging relationship and the amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were immaterial. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the notional values of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $ 739 million and $ 396 million , respectively. All the contracts mature within 12 months and, upon maturity, the amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified into earnings. The Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum of 12 months. NOTE 9: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale debt securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income (loss). 62 The table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 : Year Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Beginning balance $ ( 8 ) $ 6 Unrealized gain (losses) arising during the period, net of tax of zero 2 ( 19 ) Reclassification adjustment for gains realized and included in net income, net of tax of zero 6 5 Total other comprehensive income (loss) 8 ( 14 ) Ending balance $ — $ ( 8 ) NOTE 10: Concentrations of Credit and Operation Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available-for-sale debt securities, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1 or better. The Company invests in tax-exempt securities including municipal notes and bonds and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral. The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. The Company’s top three customers with the highest accounts receivable balances each accounted for approximately 15 % , 9 % and 8 % , respectively, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 28, 2019 and 16 % , 12 % and 7 % , respectively, of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 29, 2018 . However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company’s existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative instruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counter-party fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Company’s credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counter-party owes the Company, thus creating a receivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Company’s counter-parties, the Company determined its counter-party credit risk to be immaterial. At December 28, 2019 , the Company’s obligations under the contracts did not exceed counter-parties’ obligations. The Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for back-end manufacturing operations. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of the Company’s graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If the Company or its third-party manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure certain of these materials or its foundries are unable to procure materials for manufacturing its products, its business would be materially adversely affected. 63 NOTE 11: Earnings (Loss) Per Share Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, the assumed issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and the assumed exercise of the warrants. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125 % Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125 % Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator-Net income (loss): Numerator for basic and diluted earnings per share 341 337 ( 33 ) Denominator-Weighted average shares: Denominator for basic earnings per share 1,091 982 952 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity incentive plans and warrants 29 82 — Denominator for diluted earnings per share 1,120 1,064 952 Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.31 $ 0.34 $ ( 0.03 ) Diluted $ 0.30 $ 0.32 $ ( 0.03 ) Potential shares from employee equity incentive plans and the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes totaling 93 million and 105 million shares for 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and potential shares from employee equity incentive plans, the conversion of the 2.125 % Notes and the warrants under the Warrant Agreement totaling 189 million shares for 2017 , were not included in the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. NOTE 12: Common Stock and Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: Year Ended December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) Number of shares Balance, beginning of period 1,005 967 935 Common stock issued under employee equity incentive plans, net of tax withholding 20 31 32 Issuance of common stock upon warrant exercise 75 — — Issuance of common stock to partially settle convertible debt 69 — — Issuance of treasury stock to partially settle debt 1 7 — Balance, end of period 1,170 1,005 967 The Company’s stock-based incentive programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). The Company introduced the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three -year period from the date of grant and expire within ten years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. 64 Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant (i) stock options, and (ii) RSUs, including time-based RSUs and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs). Stock Options. A stock option is the right to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a fixed exercise price for a fixed period of time. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. Time-based RSUs. Time-based RSUs are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $ 0.00 per share. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0 % to 250 % of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Under the ESPP, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 10 % of their earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85 % of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six -month offering period. The offering periods commence in May and November each year. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had 61 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 30 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested restricted stock units. In addition, the Company had 42 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the ESPP. Valuation and Expense Stock-based compensation expense was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 6 $ 4 $ 2 Research and development 129 91 57 Marketing, general, and administrative 62 42 38 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 197 $ 137 $ 97 During 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company did no t realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore the Company did not record any related financing cash flows. Stock Options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was $ 13.31 , $ 7.62 and $ 5.46 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility 52.60% - 56.51% 51.51% - 60.46% 57.26 % Risk-free interest rate 1.53% - 2.51% 2.20% - 2.83% 1.68 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected life (in years) 3.94 - 3.95 3.92 - 3.94 3.92 The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption required by the lattice-binomial model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model. 65 The following table summarizes stock option activity and related information: Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions, except share price) Balance as of December 29, 2018 13 $ 5.33 Granted 1 $ 32.86 Canceled ( 1 ) $ 17.52 Exercised ( 3 ) $ 3.74 Balance as of December 28, 2019 10 $ 7.56 $ 226 3.20 Exercisable December 28, 2019 9 $ 4.56 $ 215 2.72 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 84 million , $ 67 million and $ 27 million , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 12 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.87 years . Time-based RSUs. The weighted-average grant date fair values of time-based RSUs granted during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were $ 32.52 , $ 17.66 and $ 12.65 per share, respectively. The following table summarizes time-based RSU activity and related information: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions except share price) Unvested shares as of December 29, 2018 24 $ 12.86 Granted 8 $ 32.52 Forfeited ( 2 ) $ 16.49 Vested ( 12 ) $ 10.39 Unvested shares as of December 28, 2019 18 $ 22.93 $ 503 1.19 The total fair value of time-based RSUs vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 395 million , $ 315 million and $ 294 million , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 322 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to time-based RSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.80 years . PRSUs. The weighted-average grant date fair values of PRSUs granted during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were $ 50.00 , $ 21.67 and $ 17.18 , respectively, using the following assumptions: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility 60.54% - 62.52% 63.77% - 67.97% 64.39 % Risk-free interest rate 1.56% - 2.49% 2.06% - 2.82% 1.50 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected term (in years) 2.48 - 5.00 2.48 - 3.00 3.00 The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock and risk-free interest rate based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the PRSUs grant at the date closest to the grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of PRSUs represents the weighted-average period the PRSUs are expected to remain outstanding. 66 The following table summarizes PRSU activity and related information: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Fair Value Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions except share price) Unvested shares as of December 29, 2018 2 $ 14.58 Granted 2 $ 50.00 Forfeited — $ 22.39 Vested ( 1 ) $ 3.60 Unvested shares as of December 28, 2019 3 $ 36.13 $ 90 2.56 The total fair value of PRSUs vested during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 65 million , $ 84 million and $ 34 million , respectively. As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 85 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to PRSUs, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 2.56 years . ESPP. The weighted-average grant date fair value for the ESPP during 2019 , 2018 and 2017 was $ 9.96 , $ 4.71 and $ 3.46 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility 48.95% - 67.02% 45.88% - 66.66% 56.07 % Risk-free interest rate 1.58% - 2.46% 2.05% - 2.52% 1.36 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected term (in years) 0.50 0.50 0.49 The Company uses the historical volatility of its common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the ESPP grant at the date closest to the ESPP grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the near future. The expected term of the ESPP represents the weighted-average period the ESPP is expected to remain outstanding. During 2019 , 1.8 million and 1.4 million shares of common stock were purchased in each of the two six -month offering periods under the ESPP at a purchase price of $ 16.18 and $ 23.77 per share, respectively, resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of $ 62 million . As of December 28, 2019 , the Company had $ 9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP, which will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 0.37 years . NOTE 13: Retirement Benefit Plans The Company provides retirement benefit plans in the United States and certain foreign countries. The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan that allows participating employees in the United States to contribute as defined by the plan and subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company matches 75 % of employees’ contributions up to 6 % of their compensation. The Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were approximately $ 25 million , $ 21 million and $ 18 million , respectively. NOTE 14: Income Taxes Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) U.S. $ 334 $ 114 $ 53 Non-U.S. 38 214 ( 68 ) Total pre-tax income (loss) including equity loss in investee $ 372 $ 328 $ ( 15 ) 67 The provision for (benefit from) income taxes consists of: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Current: U.S. Federal $ ( 13 ) $ 12 $ ( 3 ) U.S. State and Local 1 — — Non-U.S. 50 ( 17 ) 37 Total 38 ( 5 ) 34 Deferred: U.S. Federal — — ( 15 ) Non-U.S. ( 7 ) ( 4 ) ( 1 ) Total ( 7 ) ( 4 ) ( 16 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 31 $ ( 9 ) $ 18 The table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total provision for (benefit from) income taxes. 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Statutory federal income tax expense (benefit) at 21%, 21% and 35% rate $ 78 $ 69 $ 22 State taxes 1 1 1 Foreign withholding taxes (refund) 22 ( 29 ) 27 Foreign rate detriment 2 2 — Valuation allowance change ( 59 ) ( 64 ) ( 12 ) Credit monetization — ( 1 ) ( 20 ) Tax Reform Act ( 13 ) 13 — Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 31 $ ( 9 ) $ 18 The income tax provision in 2019 was primarily due to $ 22 million of tax provision of withholding tax related to cross-border transactions, $ 22 million tax provision in foreign locations offset by a $ 13 million benefit for a reduction of U.S. income taxes accrued in the prior year. The income tax provision in 2018 was primarily due to a $ 36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $ 13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $ 7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $ 7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. The income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to $ 38 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $ 27 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions, offset by $ 1 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and $ 19 million primarily attributable to the reversal of the valuation allowance on Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryovers due to the Tax Reform Act. 68 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are as follows: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryovers $ 1,455 $ 1,533 Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 245 123 Acquired intangibles and goodwill 45 101 Federal and state tax credit carryovers 617 527 Foreign research and development ITC credits 429 370 Other 159 104 Total deferred tax assets 2,950 2,758 Less: valuation allowance ( 2,743 ) ( 2,580 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 207 178 Deferred tax liabilities: Discount of convertible notes ( 22 ) ( 54 ) Undistributed foreign earnings ( 110 ) ( 105 ) Other ( 64 ) ( 15 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 196 ) ( 174 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 11 $ 4 The breakdown between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 is as follows: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Deferred tax assets $ 22 $ 15 Deferred tax liabilities ( 11 ) ( 11 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 11 $ 4 Deferred tax assets are included in Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax liabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 28, 2019 , substantially all of the Company’s U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The Company evaluates the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on available evidence whether it is more-likely-than-not (a probability level of more than 50%) that these assets will be realized. In completing this assessment management must consider both objective and subjective factors in its assessment. These factors include, but are not limited to a history of losses in prior years, unique competitiveness of the semiconductor industry, future reversal of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and loss carryforwards. After evaluating all available evidence, the Company determined that the valuation allowances for the United States and Canada should both be maintained. The Company’s United States federal and state net operating losses carryforwards as of December 28, 2019, were $ 6.7 billion and $ 0.5 billion , respectively. The United States federal net operating losses will expire between 2026 through 2037, and the state net operating losses will expire at various dates through 2037. The federal credit of $ 399 million will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2039. The state credits of $ 239 million will expire at various dates between 2020 through 2039 except for California R&D credit, which does not expire. The Company also has $ 365 million of credit carryforward in Canada that will expire between 2023 and 2028. The Tax Reform Act modified the income tax liability in the United States for companies with subsidiaries outside of the United States. As a result of the Tax Reform Act the impact of future distributions of undistributed earnings that are indefinitely 69 reinvested are anticipated to be withholding taxes from local jurisdictions. The amount of cumulative undistributed earnings that are permanently reinvested that could be subject to withholding taxes are $ 142 million as of December 28, 2019. A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 49 $ 49 $ 42 Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 5 1 7 Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years — ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 15 3 3 Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities ( 3 ) ( 2 ) — Decreases for lapsing of the statute of limitations ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) Balance at end of year $ 65 $ 49 $ 49 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $ 17 million , $ 9 million and $ 9 million as of December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . It is possible the Company may have tax audits close in the next 12 months that could materially change the balance of the uncertain tax benefits; however, the timing of tax audit closures and settlements are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has provided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Earnings from non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax. The material jurisdiction in which the Company is subject to potential examination by the taxing authority is the United States, which is open for years from 2006 onwards due to the net operating losses. NOTE 15: Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. The Company has the following two reportable segments: • the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), data center and professional GPUs and development services. The Company also licenses portions of its IP portfolio. • the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services and technology for game consoles. The Company also licenses portions of its IP portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes employee stock-based compensation expense. 70 The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 4,709 $ 4,125 $ 2,977 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 2,022 2,350 2,276 Total net revenue $ 6,731 $ 6,475 $ 5,253 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 577 $ 470 $ 92 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 263 163 132 All Other ( 209 ) ( 182 ) ( 97 ) Total operating income $ 631 $ 451 $ 127 The following table provides major items included in All Other category: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) Operating loss: Stock-based compensation expense $ ( 197 ) $ ( 137 ) $ ( 97 ) Impairment of technology licenses — ( 45 ) — Loss contingency on legal matter ( 12 ) — — Total operating loss $ ( 209 ) $ ( 182 ) $ ( 97 ) The Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. The Company’s operations outside the United States include research and development activities and sales, marketing and administrative activities. The Company conducts product and system research and development activities for its products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Canada, China, India, Taiwan and Singapore. The Company’s material sales and marketing offices are located in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. The following table summarizes sales to external customers by geographic regions based on billing location of the customer: 2019 2018 2017 (In millions) United States $ 1,764 $ 1,327 $ 1,360 China (including Hong Kong) 1,736 1,319 974 Japan 840 1,225 1,215 Europe 762 470 263 Taiwan 719 1,197 738 Singapore 597 728 550 Other countries 313 209 153 Total sales to external customers $ 6,731 $ 6,475 $ 5,253 71 The following table summarizes Property and equipment, net by geographic areas: 2019 2018 (In millions) United States $ 300 $ 232 Canada 99 51 China 36 17 Singapore 33 29 Other countries 32 19 Total property and equipment, net $ 500 $ 348 The following table summarizes sales to major customers that accounted for at least 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenue for the respective years: 2019 2018 2017 Customer A 12 % 19 % 23 % Customer B * 11 % 15 % * Less than 10% Sales to customers A and B consisted of products from the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment.

The leases expire at various dates through 2028, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years . For 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , the Company recorded $ 56 million , $ 53 million and $ 44 million , respectively, of operating lease expense, including short-term lease expense. For the year ended December 28, 2019 , the Company recorded $ 25 million of variable lease expense, which primarily included operating expenses and property taxes associated with the usage of facilities under the operating leases. For the year ended December 28, 2019 , cash paid for operating leases included in operating cash flows was $ 47 million . The Company’s finance leases and short-term leases are immaterial. Supplemental information related to leases is as follows: December 28, 2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term – operating leases 6.26 years Weighted-average discount rate – operating leases 5.55 % 72 Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating lease liabilities as of December 28, 2019 are as follows: Year (In millions) 2020 $ 54 2021 48 2022 44 2023 37 2024 33 2025 and thereafter 71 Total minimum lease payments 287 Less: interest ( 45 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 242 Less: current portion ( 43 ) Total long-term operating lease liabilities $ 199 Certain other operating leases contain provisions for escalating lease payments subject to changes in the consumer price index. Purchase and Other Contractual Obligations The Company’s purchase obligations primarily include the Company’s obligations to purchase wafers and substrates from third parties. The Company also had other contractual obligations, primarily included in Other long-term liabilities and Accrued liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet, which primarily consisted of $ 146 million of payments due under certain software and technology licenses and IP licenses that will be paid through 2022. Total future unconditional purchase obligations as of December 28, 2019 were as follows: Year (In millions) 2020 $ 1,731 2021 642 2022 58 2023 5 2024 2 2025 and thereafter 7 Total unconditional purchase commitments $ 2,445 Warranties and Indemnities Changes in the Company’s estimated liability for product warranty during the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are as follows: December 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 13 $ 12 New warranties issued during the period 31 27 Settlements during the period ( 29 ) ( 28 ) Changes in liability for pre-existing warranties during the period, including expirations — 2 Ending balance $ 15 $ 13 In addition to product warranties, the Company from time to time in its normal course of business indemnifies other parties with whom it enters into contractual relationships, including customers, lessors and parties to other transactions with the Company, with respect to certain matters. In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights 73 of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. NOTE 18: Contingencies Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company’s common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on the Company’s 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against the Company and certain of its officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of the Company’s insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On January 30, 2018, the Wessels and Hamilton plaintiffs amended their complaints. On February 2, 2018, the Ha plaintiff also filed an amended complaint. On February 22, 2018, the Company filed motions to dismiss the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs’ amended complaints. On April 2, 2018, the Company filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the Wessels amended complaint. On July 23, 2018, the Santa Clara Superior Court sustained the Company’s demurrer in the Wessels case, dismissing all claims in that matter with prejudice. The Wessels plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints. The Hamilton plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 8, 2018, and the Ha plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary reversal of the order dismissing their claims. The Company opposed this motion on December 13, 2018, and the Court denied it on February 25, 2019. The Wessels, Hamilton, and Ha appeals are currently pending. Briefing has completed in each appeal. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Hauck et al. Litigation Since January 19, 2018, three putative class action complaints have been filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: (1) Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc., Case No. 5:18-cv-0047, filed on January 19, 2018; (2) Brian Speck et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-0744, filed on February 4, 2018; and (3) Nathan Barnes and Jonathan Caskey-Medina, et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-00883, filed on February 9, 2018. On April 9, 2018, the court consolidated these cases and ordered that Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc. serve as the lead case. On June 13, 2018, six plaintiffs (from California, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts) filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that the Company failed to disclose its processors’ alleged vulnerability to Spectre. Plaintiffs further allege that the Company’s processors cannot perform at their advertised processing speeds without exposing consumers to Spectre, and that any “patches” to remedy this security vulnerability will result in degradation of processor performance. The plaintiffs seek damages under several causes of action on behalf of a nationwide class and four state subclasses (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana) of consumers who purchased 74 the Company’s processors and/or devices containing AMD processors. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees, equitable relief, and restitution. Pursuant to the court’s order directing the parties to litigate only eight of the causes of action in the consolidated amended complaint initially, the Company filed a motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018. On October 29, 2018, after the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed one of their claims, the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed six causes of action with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint on December 6, 2018. On January 3, 2019, the Company again moved to dismiss the subset of claims currently at issue. On April 4, 2019, the court granted the Company’s motion and dismissed all claims currently at issue with prejudice. On May 6, 2019, the court granted the parties’ stipulation and request under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) to enter a partial final judgment and certify for appeal the court’s April 4, 2019 dismissal order, and on that same date, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed without prejudice their remaining claims pursuant to an agreement whereby, subject to certain terms and conditions, the Company agreed to toll the statute of limitations and/or statute of repose. On May 30, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Briefing has completed for the appeal. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, the Company filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. On July 22, 2019, the Company’s motion to dismiss in the Polaris case was denied. On August 23, 2019, the Court held a claim construction hearing in each case. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD , No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that the Company misled consumers by using the term “eight cores” in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on the Company’s “Bulldozer” core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees. On December 21, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon the Company’s motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company’s motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. On March 27, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. On January 17, 2019, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The class definition does not encompass the Company’s Ryzen or EPYC processors. On January 31, 2019, the Company filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking review of certain aspects of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. On May 9, 2019, the parties attended mediation and reached a tentative settlement. On June 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Company’s petition seeking appellate review of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. On August 9, 2019, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement. On August 23, 2019, plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. On October 4, 2019, the Court granted the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Monterey Research Litigation On November 15, 2019, Monterey Research, LLC filed a patent infringement complaint against the Company in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Monterey Research alleges that the Company infringes six U.S. patents: 6,534,805 75 (related to SRAM cell design); 6,629,226 (related to read interface protocols); 6,651,134 (related to memory devices); 6,765,407 (related to programmable digital circuits); 6,961,807 (related to integrated circuits and associated memory systems); and 8,373,455 (related to output buffer circuits). Monterey Research seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, costs, and injunctive relief against the Company. On January 22, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss part of Monterey Research’s complaint. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Environmental Matters The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $ 3 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 76 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company) as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 4, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Adoption of New Accounting Standard As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for leases as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the amendments effective December 30, 2018 under the optional modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 77 Inventory Valuation Description of the Matter At December 28, 2019, the Company’s net inventory balance was $982 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company adjusts the inventory carrying value to the lower of actual cost or the estimated net realizable value after completing ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand, by considering recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. Auditing management’s inventory carrying value adjustments involved significant judgment because the estimates are based on a number of factors that are affected by market, industry, and competitive conditions outside the Company's control. In particular, in estimating inventory carrying value adjustments, management developed assumptions such as forecasts of future sales quantities and the selling prices, which are sensitive to the competitiveness of product offerings, customer requirements, and product life cycles. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company's inventory carrying value adjustment determination process, including the basis for developing above described assumptions and management’s judgments. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the reasonableness of management’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data used to determine the amount of inventory carrying value adjustments. For instance, we compared the quantities and carrying value of on-hand inventories to related unit sales, both historical and forecasted, assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimates of future sales prices by analyzing historical sales and evaluating any factors that may impact sales prices, and evaluated the appropriateness and adequacy of management’s adjustments to such sales forecasts by analyzing potential technological changes in line with product life cycles and/or identified alternative customer uses. We also assessed the accuracy of forecasts underlying management's estimates by comparing management’s historical forecasts to actual results, evaluated industry and market factors and performed sensitivity analyses over the significant assumptions used by management to evaluate necessary changes in the inventory carrying value adjustments. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California February 4, 2020 79 Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited) The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 28, 2019 , the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 28, 2019 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , which is included in Part II, Item 8, above. 81 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

Semiconductors are components used in a variety of electronic products and systems. An integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistors on a single chip. Since the invention of the transistor in 1948, improvements in IC process and design technologies have led to the development of smaller, more complex and more reliable ICs at a lower cost-per-function. The x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Markets Central Processing Unit (CPU) . A microprocessor is an IC that serves as the CPU of a computer. It generally consists of hundreds of millions or billions of transistors that process data in a serial fashion and control other devices in the system, acting as the “brain” of the computer. The performance of a microprocessor is a critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platforms, such as desktop PCs, notebooks and workstations. The principal elements used to measure CPU performance are work-per-cycle (or how many instructions are executed per cycle), clock speed (representing the rate at which a CPU’s internal logic operates, measured in units of gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second) and power consumption. Other factors impacting microprocessor performance include the process technology used in its manufacture, the number and type of cores, the ability of the cores to process multi-thread or process multiple 3 instructions simultaneously, the bit size of its instruction set (e.g., 32-bit vs 16-bit), memory size and data access speed. Developments in IC design and manufacturing process technologies have resulted in significant advances in microprocessor performance. Since businesses and consumers require greater performance from their computer systems due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software applications, multi-core microprocessors offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency because computing tasks can be spread across two or more processing cores, each of which can execute a task at full speed. Multi-core microprocessors can simultaneously increase performance of a computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted. Businesses and consumers also require computer systems with improved power management technology, which helps them to reduce the power consumption of their computer systems, enables smaller and more portable form factors, and can lower the total cost of ownership. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). A GPU is a programmable logic chip that helps render images, animations and video and is increasingly being used to handle general computing tasks. GPUs are located in plug-in cards, as a discrete processor or in a chip on the motherboard, or in the same chip as the CPU as part of an accelerated processing unit (APU) or System-on-Chip (SoC). GPUs on stand-alone cards or discrete GPUs on the motherboard typically access their own memory, while GPUs in the chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU. GPUs perform parallel operations on data to render images for a video display and are essential to presenting computer generated images on that display, decoding and rendering animations and displaying video. The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother moving objects can be displayed on video display or in a virtual environment (virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)). In addition to graphics processing, GPUs are used to perform parallel operations on multiple sets of data and are increasingly used to perform vector processing for non-graphics applications that require repetitive computations such as supercomputing, deep learning, artificial and machine intelligence, blockchain and various other applications (e.g., cryptocurrency mining, autonomous driving). Accelerated Processing Unit (APU). Consumers increasingly demand computing devices with improved end-user experience, system performance and energy efficiency. Consumers also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile devices, with better performance and longer battery life. We believe that a computing architecture that optimizes the use of its components can provide these improvements. An APU is a processing unit that integrates a CPU and a GPU onto one chip (or one piece of silicon), along with, in some cases, other special-purpose components. This integration enhances system performance by “offloading” selected tasks to the best-suited component (i.e., the CPU or the GPU) to optimize component use, increasing the speed of data flow between the CPU and GPU through shared memory and allowing the GPU to function as both a graphics engine and an application accelerator. Having the CPU and GPU on the same chip also typically improves energy efficiency by, for example, eliminating connections between discrete chips. System-on-Chip (SoC) . An SoC is a type of IC with a CPU, GPU and other components, such as a memory controller and peripheral management, comprising a complete computing system on a single chip. By combining all of these elements as an SoC, system performance and energy efficiency is improved, similar to an APU. Chipset. A chipset is a generic term referring to a device or a collection of devices that allow the microprocessor to connect to a wider range of peripheral devices in the system (such as storage, optical drives, and Universal Serial Bus (USB) peripherals). Chipsets can perform essential logic functions, and operate in concert with the microprocessor to manage system control and power management functions of all the devices in the system. Chipsets are most often found in larger form factor systems, typically desktop systems or larger notebook platforms, which require the expanded peripheral selection that is enabled by the chipset. Typical notebook platforms and small form factor desktop platforms typically do not utilize a chipset and instead rely on the capabilities of the APU to connect to all the required devices on the platform. Our x86 Microprocessor and Chipset Products Our microprocessors are incorporated into computing platforms, which are a collection of technologies that are designed to work together to provide a more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing components. We believe that integrated, balanced computing platforms consisting of microprocessors, chipsets (either as discrete devices or integrated into an SoC) and GPUs (either as discrete GPUs or integrated into an APU or SoC) that work together at the system level bring end users improved system stability, increased performance and enhanced power efficiency. In addition, we believe our customers also benefit from an all-AMD platform (consisting of an APU or CPU, a discrete GPU, and an AMD Fusion Controller Hub chip when needed), as we are able to optimize interoperability, provide our customers a single 4 point of contact for the key platform components and enable them to bring the platforms to market quickly in a variety of PC and server system form factors. We currently base our microprocessors and chipsets on the x86 instruction set architecture and the AMD Infinity Fabric, which connects an on-chip memory controller and input/output (I/O) channels directly to one or more microprocessor cores. We typically integrate two or more processor cores onto a single die, and each core has its own dedicated cache, which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die, permitting quick access to frequently used data and instructions. Some of our microprocessors have additional levels of cache such as L2, or second-level cache, and L3, or third-level cache, to enable fast data access and high performance. We focus on continually improving the energy efficiency of our products through our design principles and innovations in power management technology. To that end, we offer CPUs, GPUs, APUs, SoCs and chipsets with multiple low power states that are designed to utilize lower clock speeds and voltages to reduce processor power consumption during active and idle times. The use of intelligent, dynamic power management is designed to create lower energy use by allowing compute applications to be completed quickly and efficiently, enabling a return to the ultra-low power idle state. Desktop. In February 2018, we introduced two AMD Ryzen™ desktop processors with built-in Radeon™ Vega graphics models. AMD Ryzen 5 2400G and AMD Ryzen 3 2200G processors combine four of the latest “Zen” CPU cores with advanced Radeon “Vega” architecture on a single chip. In April 2018, we announced the global availability of our second generation Ryzen desktop processors which include four models: Ryzen 7 2700X, Ryzen 7 2700, Ryzen 5 2600X, and Ryzen 5 2600 processors that are optimized for gamers, creators, and hardware enthusiasts. These four models use 12nm process technology to offer high gaming performance and multiprocessing performance. In August 2018, we announced the availability of our second generation AMD Ryzen™ Threadripper™ 2990WX processor with 32 cores and 64 threads and the Ryzen Threadripper 2950X with 16 cores and 32 threads. In September 2018, we launched a reimagined family of AMD Athlon™ desktop processors with Radeon™ Vega graphics: AMD Athlon 200GE, Athlon 220GE, and Athlon 240GE. These desktop processors combine our x86 “Zen” core and “Vega” graphics architectures on an SOC design. They are designed to offer responsive and reliable computing for web-browsing and video streaming. In October 2018, we launched two additional second generation AMD Ryzen Threadripper processor models, the Ryzen 2970WX with 24 cores and 48 threads and the Ryzen Threadripper 2920X with 12 cores and 24 threads. The Ryzen Threadripper WX series focuses on computational power for heavy workloads and the Ryzen Threadripper X series provides enthusiasts, gamers and streamers high performance and a smooth gaming experience. Notebooks and 2-in-1s. We continue to invest in designing and developing high performing and low power APUs for notebook PC platforms for the consumer market. In 2018, we introduced the Ryzen 7 2700U Mobile processor with Radeon RX Vega 10 Graphics, the Ryzen 5 2500U Mobile Processor with Radeon Vega 8 Graphics, the Ryzen 3 2300U Mobile Processor with Radeon Vega 6 Graphics, and the Ryzen 3 2200U Mobile Processor with Radeon Vega 3 Graphics. In addition to the Ryzen™ Mobile family, we also continue to offer AMD A-Series APUs based on previous generation CPU and graphics architectures, primarily targeting the value and mainstream segments.

Graphics Market The semiconductor graphics market addresses the need for improved visual and data processing in various computing devices. Many consumers value a rich visual experience to enable a more compelling and immersive experience, and, for these consumers, the PC has evolved from a traditional data processing and communications device to an entertainment platform. As a result, visual realism and graphical display capabilities are key product differentiation elements among computing devices. This has led to increasing creation and use of processing-intensive multimedia content for computing devices, including playing games, capturing media content, viewing online videos, editing photos and managing digital content. In turn, these trends have contributed to higher consumer demand for performance graphics solutions and to manufacturers designing computing devices with these capabilities. Industries that utilize computer assisted design (CAD), that develop content for media and entertainment markets and that generate professional visualizations and renderings can benefit greatly from graphics solutions optimized for the professional graphics market. In addition to traditional graphics markets, there is a large and growing market for graphics compute which is primarily made up of high performance compute and machine learning/deep learning. Traditional high performance compute focuses on scientific research, model simulation, and exploration which is mainly driven by university and government research needs for high precision graphics compute workloads. The second market is the rapidly growing area of machine learning and deep learning workloads. Graphics processors are used both in the training of machine learning models as well as the application of models via inference. The expansion of compute workloads on graphics processors is driving market expansion for traditional graphics silicon. Another area of the market for graphics compute is blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger used to securely store, transmit and process sensitive and valuable data. Currently, the most well-known use case of blockchain is cryptocurrency; however, the number of applications and the potential impact of blockchain technology goes much further. Blockchain applications are typically performed using specifically designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) or a general purpose CPU or GPU. Our Graphics Products Graphics processing is a fundamental component of almost everything we create and can be found in an APU, CPU, SoC or a combination of a discrete GPU with one of the other foregoing products working in tandem. Our customers generally use our graphics solutions to increase the speed of rendering images, to help improve image resolution and color definition, and increasingly to process massive data sets for cloud and datacenter applications. We develop our graphics products for use in various computing devices and entertainment platforms, including desktop PCs, notebook PCs, 2-in-1s, All-in-Ones (AIOs), professional workstations, and the datacenter. With each of our graphics products, we have available drivers and supporting software packages that enable the effective use of these products under a variety of operating systems and applications. Our APUs deliver visual processing functionality for value and mainstream PCs by integrating a CPU and a GPU on a single chip, while discrete GPUs (which are also known as dGPUs) offer high performance graphics processing across all platforms. AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing or General Purpose GPU (GPGPU) refers to a set of advanced hardware and software technologies that enable discrete AMD GPUs, working in concert with the CPU, to accelerate computational tasks beyond traditional CPU processing by utilizing the vast number of discrete GPU cores while working with the CPU to process information cooperatively. In addition, computing devices with heterogeneous computing features run computationally-intensive tasks more efficiently, which we believe provides a superior application experience to the end user. Moreover, heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the GPU to the same level as the CPU for memory access, queuing and execution. Discrete Desktop and Notebook Graphics . Our discrete GPUs for desktop and notebook PCs support current generation application program interface (APIs) like DirectX® 12 and Vulkan™, support new displays using Radeon™ FreeSync™ and Radeon™ FreeSync HDR™ technologies, and are designed to support VR in PC platforms. In June 2018, we introduced the Radeon™ RX Vega56 Nano Edition bringing Vega graphics to small form factor PCs. In October 2018, we introduced new AMD Radeon Vega Mobile graphics processors for next generation notebooks powered by the AMD “Vega” architecture for cool and quiet operation. In November 2018, we introduced the Radeon RX 590 graphics card built upon 12 nm process technology. The Radeon RX 590 pairs with the advanced AMD Radeon FreeSync gaming display technology to deliver an exceptional gaming experience. In December 2018, we announced AMD Radeon™ Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition, the next generation of our software suite for AMD Radeon GPUs that provides gamers, creators and enthusiasts with new 6 immersive features for visual experiences. It provides high performance and enables streaming of PC-based games and video to mobile devices as well as to standalone VR headsets.

Software drivers for AMD Radeon Pro cards are designed to deliver high stability and performance across a wide variety of software packages including those requiring certifications for end user use. Our AMD Radeon™ Instinct family of GPU products are specifically designed to address growing demand for datacenter applications, including deep learning training and inference, as well as traditional high performance computing (HPC) workloads such as simulation where the compute capabilities of GPUs provide exceptional flexibility and performance. Combined with our open-source software, Radeon Open Ecosystem (ROCm), we can deliver acceleration platforms to address intensive predictive data analytics challenges while minimizing power and space needs in the datacenter. We also provide the AMD FirePro™ S-Series GPU products for the server market, which target HPC primarily focused on artificial and machine intelligence, deep neutral networks (DNN), geosciences, biosciences, academic and government workloads, and virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) use cases primarily focused on workstation-class virtualization, remote desktop and content streaming workloads. In August 2018, we announced the AMD Radeon™ Pro WX 8200 graphics card for high-end workstation graphics performance. Also in August 2018, we announced the Radeon™ Pro V340 graphics card, a high-performance dual-GPU Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solution purpose-built to power and accelerate datacenter visualization workloads, including CAD, design, Desktop as a Service (DaaS) and rendering. The AMD Radeon Pro V340 graphics card is a dual-GPU solution based on the advanced AMD “Vega” architecture. In November 2018, we announced AMD Radeon Instinct™ MI60 and MI50 accelerators, 7nm datacenter GPUs, designed to deliver the compute performance required for next-generation deep learning, HPC, cloud computing and rendering applications. The AMD Radeon Instinct MI60 and MI50 accelerators feature flexible mixed-precision capabilities, powered by high-performance compute units that expand the types of workloads these accelerators can address, including a range of HPC and deep learning applications. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Markets Server. A server is a computer system that performs services for connected customer businesses as part of a client-server architecture. Many servers are designed to run an application or applications often for extended periods of time with minimal human intervention. Examples of servers include cloud, web, e-mail and print servers. These servers can run a variety of applications, including business intelligence, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management and advanced scientific or engineering models to solve advanced computational problems in disciplines ranging from financial modeling to weather forecasting to oil and gas exploration. Servers are also used in cloud computing, which is a computing model where data, applications and services are delivered over the internet or an intranet which can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort. Today’s datacenters require new technologies and configuration models to meet the demand driven by the growing amount of data that needs to be stored, accessed and managed. Servers must be efficient, scalable and adaptable to meet the compute characteristics of new and changing workloads. Embedded . Embedded products address computing needs in PC-adjacent markets, such as industrial control and automation, digital signage, point-of-sale/self-service kiosks, medical imaging and casino gaming machines as well as enterprise-class telecommunications, networking, security, storage systems and thin clients (which are computers that serve as an access device on a network). Typically, AMD embedded products are used in applications that require high to moderate levels of performance, where key features may include mobility, relatively low power, small form factor, and 24x7 operations. High-performance graphics are increasingly important in many embedded systems. Support for Linux ® , Windows ® and other operating systems as well as for increasingly sophisticated applications are also critical for some customers. Other requirements may include meeting rigid specifications for industrial temperatures, shock, vibration and reliability. The embedded market has moved from developing proprietary, custom designs to leveraging industry-standard instruction set architectures and processors as a way to help reduce costs and speed time to market. Semi-Custom . We have leveraged our core IP, including our graphics and processing technologies developed for the gaming, VR, AR and machine intelligence markets, to develop semi-custom solutions for customers who want differentiation in their products. In this market, semiconductor suppliers work alongside system designers and manufacturers to enhance 7 the performance and overall user experience for semi-custom customers. AMD has used this type of collaborative development approach with many of today’s leading game console manufacturers and can also address customer needs in many other markets beyond game consoles. AMD leverages our existing IP to create a variety of products tailored to a specific customer’s needs, ranging from complex fully-customized SoCs to more modest adaptations and integrations of existing CPU, APU or GPU products. Our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Products Server Processors. Our microprocessors for server platforms currently include the AMD EPYC™ Series processors and AMD Opteron™ X and A-Series processors. The AMD EPYC 7000 Series of high performance processors that have up to 32 “Zen” compute cores and are designed to support a full range of integer, floating point, memory bandwidth and I/O benchmarks and workloads. The AMD Opteron X3000 Series APUs are a family of fully integrated CPU, GPU and I/O designed to provide processing and graphics performance for personal and small business needs. Embedded Processors . Our embedded processors are increasingly driving intelligence into new areas of our lives, like interactive digital signage, casino gaming, and medical imaging devices. These products are designed to support greater connectivity and productivity, and we believe they can be a strong driver for the “internet of things” and “immersive computing” areas in the computing industry. Our products for embedded platforms include AMD Embedded R-Series APU, CPU and SoC, AMD Embedded G-Series SoC platform and AMD Embedded Radeon™ GPUs. In February 2018, we introduced two new product families, the AMD EPYC™ Embedded 3000 processor and AMD Ryzen™ Embedded V1000 processor. The AMD EPYC Embedded 3000 brings the power of “Zen” to a variety of new markets including networking, storage, and edge computing devices. AMD Ryzen Embedded V1000 targets medical imaging, industrial systems, digital gaming and thin clients. Semi-Custom . Our semi-custom products are tailored, high-performance, customer-specific solutions based on AMD’s CPU, GPU and multi-media technologies. We work closely together with our customers to define solutions to precisely match the requirements of the device or application. Historically we have leveraged our core graphics processing technology into the game console market by licensing our graphic technology in game consoles such as the Microsoft ® Xbox 360™ and Nintendo Wii and Wii U. We developed the semi-custom SoC products that power the current generation Sony PlayStation® 4 and PlayStation ® 4 Pro and Microsoft ® Xbox One™ and Xbox One S™ and Xbox One X™ game consoles. Marketing and Sales We sell our products through our direct sales force and through independent distributors and sales representatives in both domestic and international markets. Our sales arrangements generally operate on the basis of product forecasts provided by the particular customer, but do not typically include any commitment or requirement for minimum product purchases. We primarily use purchase orders, sales order acknowledgments and contractual agreements as evidence of our sales arrangements. Our agreements typically contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as payment terms, warranties and indemnities for issues specific to our products. We generally warrant that our products sold to our customers will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. We may also offer one to three year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. We market and sell our latest products under the AMD trademark. Our desktop PC product brands for microprocessors are AMD Ryzen™, AMD Ryzen™ PRO, Threadripper™, AMD A-Series, AMD FX™ , AMD Athlon™, AMD Athlon™ PRO, and AMD Pro A-Series processors. Our notebook and 2-in-1s for microprocessors are AMD Ryzen™ processors with Radeon™ Vega GPUs, AMD A-Series, AMD Athlon, AMD Ryzen™ PRO and AMD Pro A-Series processors. Our server brands for microprocessors are AMD EPYC™ and AMD Opteron™ processors. We also sell low-power versions of our AMD Opteron, AMD Athlon , as well as AMD Geode™, AMD Ryzen™, AMD EPYC™, AMD R-Series and G-Series processors as embedded processor solutions. Our product brand for the consumer graphics market is AMD Radeon™ graphics, and AMD Embedded Radeon™ graphics is our product brand for the embedded graphics market. Our product brand for professional graphics products are AMD Radeon™ Pro and AMD FirePro™ graphics as well as Radeon Instinct™ accelerators for servers. We also market and sell our chipsets under AMD trademarks. We market our products through direct marketing and co-marketing programs. In addition, we have cooperative advertising and marketing programs with customers and third parties, including market development programs, pursuant to which we may provide product information, training, marketing materials and funds. Under our co-marketing development programs, eligible customers can use market development funds as reimbursement for advertisements and marketing programs related to our products and third-party systems integrating our products, subject to meeting defined criteria. 8 Customers Our microprocessor customers consist primarily of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), large direct datacenters, original design manufacturers (ODMs), system integrators and independent distributors in both domestic and international markets. ODMs provide design and/or manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private label resellers, OEMs and system builders. Our graphics product customers include the foregoing as well as add-in-board manufacturers (AIBs). Large direct datacenters consist of cloud service providers. Customers of our chipset products consist primarily of PC OEMs, often through ODMs or other contract manufacturers, who build the OEM motherboards, as well as desktop and server motherboard manufacturers who incorporate chipsets into their channel motherboards. We work closely with our customers to define product features, performance and timing of new products so that the products we are developing meet our customers’ needs. We also employ application engineers to assist our customers in designing, testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products. We believe that our commitment to customer service and design support improves our customers’ time-to-market and fosters relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products. We also work with our customers to create differentiated products that leverage our CPU, GPU and APU technology. Customers of our semi-custom products pay us non-recurring engineering fees for design and development services and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. Our major customers, Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Microsoft Corporation , each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 29, 2018 . Sales to Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC and Microsoft Corporation consisted of products from our Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. A loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. Original Equipment Manufacturers We focus on three types of OEM customers: multi-nationals, selected regional accounts and some local system integrators, who target commercial and consumer end customers of all sizes. Large multi-nationals and regional accounts are the core of our OEM customers. Our OEM customers include numerous foreign and domestic manufacturers of servers and workstations, desktops, notebooks, PC motherboards and game consoles. Third-Party Distributors Our authorized channel distributors resell to sub-distributors and mid-sized and smaller OEMs and ODMs. Typically, distributors handle a wide variety of products, and may include those that compete with our products. Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions and provide return rights with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing code date. In addition, some agreements with our distributors may contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Add-in-Board (AIB) Manufacturers and System Integrators We offer component-level graphics and chipset products to AIB manufacturers who in turn build and sell board-level products using our technology to system integrators (SIs), retail buyers and sub distributors. Our agreements with AIBs protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. We also sell directly to our SI customers. SIs typically sell from positions of regional or product-based strength in the market. They usually operate on short design cycles and can respond quickly with new technologies. SIs often use discrete graphics solutions as a means to differentiate their products and add value to their customers. Competition in the Microprocessor and Chipset Market Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past resulted in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affected our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor 9 market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. OEMs that purchase microprocessors for computer systems are highly dependent on Intel, which can make them less innovative on their own and, to a large extent, can become distributors of Intel technology. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: • business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions which may limit our market share and margins; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners that require or result in exclusive product arrangements; • de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and • marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its OEM customers and retailers. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and lower average selling prices for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Other competitors include a variety of companies providing or developing ARM-based designs at relatively low cost and low power processors for the computing market including tablets and thin-client form factors, as well as dense servers, set-top boxes and gaming consoles. ARM Holdings designs and licenses its ARM cores and architecture to third parties, including us, and offers supporting software and services. Our ability to compete with companies who use ARM-based solutions depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy-efficient, high-performing products at an attractive price point. Competition in the Graphics Markets In the graphics market, our competitors include suppliers of discrete graphics, embedded graphics processors and integrated graphics processor (IGP) chipsets. Intel manufactures and sells embedded graphics processors and IGP chipsets, and is a dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business. Higher unit shipments of our APUs and Intel’s integrated graphics may drive computer manufacturers to reduce the number of systems they build paired with discrete graphics components, particularly for notebooks, because they may offer satisfactory graphics performance for most mainstream PC users, at a lower cost. Intel could take actions that place our discrete GPUs and IGP chipsets at a competitive disadvantage such as giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel is developing its own high-end discrete GPUs. Our principal competitor in the discrete graphics market is Nvidia and they are considered the market share leader. Other competitors include a number of smaller companies, which may have greater flexibility to address specific market needs, but less financial resources to do so, especially as we believe that the growing complexity of graphics processors and the associated research and development costs represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market. We are the market share leader in semi-custom game console products, where graphics performance is critical, we compete primarily against Nvidia. Competition in the Server Markets 10 In the server market, we compete primarily against Intel. Research and Development We focus our research and development activities on improving product performance and enhancing product design. Our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of CPU and GPU IP, and designing that IP into our SoCs for our next generation of products, with, in each case, improved system performance and performance-per-watt characteristics. For example, we are focusing on improving the battery life of our APU products for notebooks and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete GPUs and our microprocessors for servers. We are also focusing on delivering a range of low-power integrated platforms to serve key markets, including commercial clients, mobile computing and gaming. We believe that these platforms will bring customers increased performance and energy efficiency. We also work with industry leaders on process technology, software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortia to conduct early stage research and development. We conduct product and system research and development activities for our products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in Australia, China, Canada, India, Singapore and Taiwan, who undertake specific activities at the direction of our U.S. headquarters. Manufacturing Arrangements and Assembly and Test Facilities Third-Party Wafer Foundry Facilities GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc . On March 2, 2009, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (WSA) with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF). The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF, a related party to us. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU products from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . We also have foundry arrangements with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) for the production of wafers for certain products. Other Third-Party Manufacturers . We outsource board-level graphics product manufacturing to third-party manufacturers. Assembly, Test, Mark and Packaging Facilities Wafers for our products are delivered from third-party foundries to our test, assembly and packaging partners located in the Asia-Pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor products. We are party to two assembly, test, mark and pack (ATMP) joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs, Intellectual Property and Licensing We rely on contracts and intellectual property rights to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. Intellectual property rights include copyrights, patents, patent applications, trademarks, trade secrets and mask work rights. As of December 29, 2018 , we had approximately 5,000 patents in the United States and approximately 900 patent applications pending in the United States. In certain cases, we have filed corresponding applications in foreign jurisdictions. Including United States and foreign matters, we have approximately 10,600 patent matters worldwide consisting of approximately 8,000 issued patents and 2,600 patent applications pending. We expect to file future patent applications in both the United States and abroad on significant inventions, as we deem appropriate. We do not believe that any individual patent, or the expiration of any patent, is or would be material to our business. As is typical in the semiconductor industry, we have numerous cross-licensing and technology exchange agreements with other companies under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property rights. One such agreement is the cross-license agreement that we entered into with Intel on November 11, 2009. Under the cross-license agreement, we granted to Intel and Intel granted to us, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to all of each other’s patents that were first filed no later than November 11, 2014 and each party can exploit these patents anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor- and electronic-related products. Under the cross-license agreement, Intel has rights to make semiconductor products for third parties, but the third-party product designs are not licensed as a result of such manufacture. We have rights to perform assembly and testing for third parties but not rights to make semiconductor products for third parties. The term of the cross-license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated. A party can terminate the cross-license agreement or the rights and licenses of 11 the other party if the other party materially breaches the cross-license agreement and does not correct the noticed material breach within 60 days. Upon such termination, the terminated party’s license rights terminate but the terminating party’s license rights continue, subject to that party’s continued compliance with the terms of the cross-license agreement. The cross-license agreement will automatically terminate if a party undergoes a change of control (as defined in the cross license agreement), and both parties’ licenses will terminate. Upon the bankruptcy of a party, that party may assume, but may not assign, the cross-license agreement, and in the event that the cross-license agreement cannot be assumed, the cross-license agreement and the licenses granted will terminate. Backlog Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for current delivery or agreements covering purchases over a period of time. Some of these orders or agreements may be revised or canceled without penalty. Generally, in light of current industry practice, we do not believe that such orders or agreements provide meaningful backlog figures or are necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period. With respect to our semi-custom SoC products, our orders and agreements are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter. Seasonality Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters. Employees As of December 29, 2018 , we had approximately 10,100 employees. Environmental Regulations Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers' compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. We could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used, stored, released, disposed of by us or located at, under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damage. While we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditures, we cannot assure you that future environmental legal requirements will not become more stringent or costly in the future. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety laws, and our liabilities arising from past and future releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances will not have a material adverse effect on us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions, may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the U.S. Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on 12 persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. 13 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring simultaneously. Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively. Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. These aggressive activities have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for many of our products and adversely affect our margins and profitability. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. As a result of Intel’s position in the microprocessor market, Intel has been able to control x86 microprocessor and computer system standards and benchmarks and to dictate the type of products the microprocessor market requires of us. Intel also dominates the computer system platform, which includes core logic chipsets, graphics chips, networking devices (wired and wireless), non-volatile storage and other components necessary to assemble a computer system. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. Intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amounts on marketing and research and development than we do. We expect Intel to maintain its market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies. To the extent Intel manufactures a significantly larger portion of its microprocessor products using more advanced process technologies, or introduces competitive new products into the market before we do, we may be more vulnerable to Intel’s aggressive marketing and pricing strategies for microprocessor products. As long as Intel remains in this dominant position, we may be materially adversely affected by Intel’s: • business practices, including rebating and allocation strategies and pricing actions, designed to limit our market share and margins; • product mix and introduction schedules; • product bundling, marketing and merchandising strategies; • exclusivity payments to its current and potential customers, retailers and channel partners; • de facto control over industry standards, and heavy influence on PC manufacturers and other PC industry participants, including motherboard, memory, chipset and basic input/output system (BIOS) suppliers and software companies as well as the graphics interface for Intel platforms; and • marketing and advertising expenditures in support of positioning the Intel brand over the brand of its original equipment manufacturer OEM customers and retailers. Intel could also take actions that place our discrete GPUs at a competitive disadvantage, including giving one or more of our competitors in the graphics market, such as Nvidia Corporation, preferential access to its proprietary graphics interface or other useful information. Also, Intel recently announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs. Intel’s position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphics chipset market, its introduction of competitive new products, its existing relationships with top-tier OEMs, and its aggressive marketing and pricing strategies could result in lower unit sales and a lower average selling price for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We have a wafer supply agreement with GF with obligations to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of our GPU product requirements manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer from GF, with limited exceptions. If GF is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements, our business could be adversely impacted. The wafer supply agreement (WSA) governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. The WSA is in place until 2024. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a portion of our GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. If GF is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yields, manufacture our products on a timely basis at competitive prices or meet our capacity requirements, then we may experience supply shortages for certain products or increased costs and our business could be materially adversely affected. 14 In January 2019, we entered into the seventh amendment to the WSA with GF (the Seventh Amendment). The Seventh Amendment modifies certain purchase commitments, pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm technology node and above by us for the period commencing January 1, 2019 and continuing through March 1, 2024. If we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. If our actual wafer requirements are less than the number of wafers required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target, we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit costs, both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our results of operations. In addition, GF has relied on Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech) for its funding needs. If Mubadala Tech fails to adequately fund GF on a timely basis, or at all, and if GF is not otherwise able to adequately fund its operations, GF’s ability to manufacture products for us could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected. We rely on third-party wafer foundries to fabricate the silicon wafers for all of our products. We also rely on third-party manufacturers to assemble, test, mark and pack (ATMP) our products. It is important to have reliable relationships with all of these third-party manufacturing suppliers to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand. We cannot guarantee that these manufacturers or our other third-party manufacturing suppliers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements. If we experience supply constraints from our third-party manufacturing suppliers, we may be required to allocate the affected products amongst our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with these customers and on our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing suppliers, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with some of our third-party manufacturing suppliers. We obtain some of these manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and these manufacturers are not required to provide us with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantities in an existing purchase order. Accordingly, we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. The manufacturers we use also fabricate wafers and ATMP products for other companies, including certain of our competitors. They could choose to prioritize capacity for other customers, increase the prices that they charge us on short notice or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Other risks associated with our dependence on third-party manufacturers include limited control over delivery schedules and quality assurance, lack of capacity in periods of excess demand, misappropriation of our intellectual property, dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractors and limited ability to manage inventory and parts. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages, lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to secure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions. If we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supplies of products, our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business. If we transition the production of some of our products to new manufacturers, we may experience delayed product introductions, lower yields or poorer performance of our products. If we experience problems with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from a particular third-party manufacturer, or if we for other reasons cease utilizing one of those suppliers, we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in a short time frame. We could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third-party manufacturers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are party to two ATMP joint ventures (collectively, the JVs) with Tongfu Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results. Semiconductor manufacturing yields are a result of both product design and process technology, which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer, and low yields can result from design failures, process technology failures or a combination of both. Our third-party foundries, including GF, are responsible for the process technologies used to fabricate silicon wafers. If our third-party foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies or encounter disruptions, errors or difficulties during production, we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays. We cannot be certain that our third-party foundries will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement leading-edge process technologies needed to manufacture future generations of our products profitably or on a timely basis or that our competitors will not develop new technologies, products 15 or processes earlier. Moreover, during periods when foundries are implementing new process technologies, their manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive. A substantial delay in the technology transitions to smaller process technologies could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if our competitors transition to more cost effective technologies before us. For example, we are presently focusing our 7nm product portfolio on Taiwan Semiconductor Co., Ltd.’s (TSMC) 7nm process. If TSMC is not able to manufacture our products on 7nm in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in per unit costs, which would adversely impact our gross margin and/or force us to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customers, which could harm our relationships and reputation with our customers and materially adversely affect our business. The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions. Our success depends to a significant extent on the development, qualification, implementation and acceptance of new product designs and improvements that provide value to our customers. Our ability to develop, qualify and distribute, and have manufactured, new products and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, at prices acceptable to our customers and on a timely basis are significant factors in determining our competitiveness in our target markets. As consumers have new product feature preferences or have different requirements than those consumers in the PC market, PC sales could be negatively impacted, which could adversely impact our business. Our product roadmap includes our next generation AMD Ryzen, AMD Radeon and AMD EPYC processors using 7 nm process technology. We cannot assure you that our efforts to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers. If we fail to or are delayed in developing, qualifying or shipping new products or technologies that provide value to our customers and address these new trends or if we fail to predict which new form factors consumers will adopt and adjust our business accordingly, we may lose competitive positioning, which could cause us to lose market share and require us to discount the selling prices of our products. Although we make substantial investments in research and development, we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop, obtain or successfully implement new products and technologies on a timely basis or that they will be well-received by our customers. Moreover, our investments in new products and technologies involve certain risks and uncertainties and could disrupt our ongoing business. New investments may not generate sufficient revenue, may incur unanticipated liabilities and may divert our limited resources and distract management from our current operations. We cannot be certain that our ongoing investments in new products and technologies will be successful, will meet our expectations and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results. Delays in developing, qualifying or shipping new products can also cause us to miss our customers’ product design windows or, in some cases, breach contractual obligations or cause us to pay penalties. If our customers do not include our products in the initial design of their computer systems or products, they will typically not use our products in their systems or products until at least the next design configuration. The process of being qualified for inclusion in a customer’s system or product can be lengthy and could cause us to further miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which also could result in a loss of market share and harm our business. We also depend on the success and timing of our customers’ platform launches. If our customers delay their product launches or if our customers do not effectively market their platforms with our products, it could result in a delay in bringing our products to market and cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end-users, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, market demand requires that products incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. Over the life of a specific product, the sale price is typically reduced over time. The introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price. If we are unable to introduce new products with sufficiently high sale prices or to increase unit sales volumes capable of offsetting the reductions in the sale prices of existing products over time, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing, we may face a cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investments in research and development or other strategic investments. Our ability to fund research and development expenditures depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operations and the availability of external financing, if necessary. Our research and development expenditures, together with ongoing operating expenses, will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balances. If new competitors, technological advances by existing competitors, or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in our research and development efforts, our operating expenses would increase. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without an increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. We regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities, including debt and equity financing. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or, if available, may not be available on satisfactory terms. The health of the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed. Any downgrades from credit rating agencies such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the terms of such financing. Credit agency downgrades or concerns regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationships with our suppliers, who may 16 limit our credit lines. Our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operations may require us to abandon projects or curtail planned investments in research and development or other strategic initiatives. If we curtail planned investments in research and development or abandon projects, our products may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a significant part of our revenue in the future. If one of our key customers decides to stop buying our products, or if one of these customers materially reduces or reorganizes its operations or its demand for our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. Our receipt of revenue from our semi-custom SoC products is dependent upon our technology being designed into third-party products and the success of those products. The revenue that we receive from our semi-custom SoC products is in the form of non-recurring engineering fees charged to third parties for design and development services and revenue received in connection with sales of our semi-custom SoC products to these third parties. As a result, our ability to generate revenue from our semi-custom products depends on our ability to secure customers for our semi-custom design pipeline, our customers’ desire to pursue the project, and our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into those customer’s products. Any revenue from sales of our semi-custom SoC products is directly related to sales of the third-party’s products and reflective of their success in the market. Moreover, we have no control over the marketing efforts of these third parties, and we cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. Consequently, the semi-custom SoC product revenue expected by us may not be fully realized and our operating results may be adversely affected. Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. Uncertain global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business, including, without limitation, a slowdown in the Chinese economy, one of the largest global markets for desktop and notebook PCs. Uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customers to postpone purchases. In addition, during challenging economic times, our current or potential future customers may experience cash flow problems and as a result may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products. Additionally, if our customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing, they may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable that they owe us. The risk related to our customers’ potentially defaulting on or delaying payments to us is increased because we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenue. Any inability of our current or potential future customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow. Moreover, our key suppliers may reduce their output or become insolvent, thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our products. In addition, uncertain economic conditions may make it more difficult for us to raise funds through borrowings or private or public sales of debt or equity securities. Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us . The products that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could result in, among other things, the loss, corruption, theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issues. Our efforts to prevent and address security vulnerabilities may decrease performance, be only partially effective or not successful at all. We may also depend on third parties, such as customers, vendors and end users, to deploy our mitigations or create their own, and they may delay, decline or modify the implementation of such mitigations. Our relationships with our customers could be adversely affected as some of our customers may stop purchasing our products, reduce or delay future purchases of our products, or use competing products. Any of these actions by our customers could adversely affect our revenue. We also are subject to claims and litigation related to side-channel exploits, such as Spectre, and may face additional claims or litigation for future vulnerabilities. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities of our products may subject us to adverse publicity, damage to our brand and reputation, and could materially harm our business or financial results. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations. In the ordinary course of our business, we maintain sensitive data on our information technology (IT) assets, and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partners ’ and third party providers ’ IT assets, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customers and business partners. Maintaining the security of this information is critical to our business and reputation. We believe that companies have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents, cyber-attacks, hacking and phishing attacks, and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. These threats can come from a variety of sources, all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to a state-sponsored attack. Cyber threats may be generic, or they may be custom-crafted against our information systems. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. 17 Our network and storage applications, as well as those of our customers, business partners, and third-party providers, may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions. It is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused by such incidents. These data breaches and any unauthorized access, misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Cyber-attacks on us or our customers, business partners or third party providers could also cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These incidents could also subject us to liability, expose us to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business. In addition, we are currently subject to claims and could be subject to additional claims in the future for damages resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerabilities in the security of our processors. We also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our workers. The integrity and protection of our worker and consumer data is critical to our business and our workers and consumers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. We anticipate an increase in costs related to: • enhancing and implementing information security controls, including costs related to upgrading application, computer, and network security components; • training workers to maintain and monitor our security controls; • remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation; • mitigating reputational harm; and • compliance with external regulations. We often partner with third-party providers for certain worker services and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers’ data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. A breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. The profile of our sales may be weighted differently during the year. A large portion of our quarterly sales have historically been made in the last month of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition. In addition, our operating results tend to vary seasonally with the markets in which our products are sold. For example, historically, first quarter PC product sales are generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters. Many of the factors that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trends are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligations or meet our working capital requirements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance, which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and is subject to prevailing economic, financial and business conditions along with other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds, including under our secured revolving line of credit for a principal amount up to $500 million (our Secured Revolving Line of Credit), in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets or equity, reduce expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or equity, borrow funds under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We have a large amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations. Our total debt as of December 29, 2018 was $1.3 billion, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% Notes. Our large indebtedness may: • make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments; • limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes; 18 • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes; • require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments; • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with relatively less debt; and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions. We enter into sale and factoring arrangements from time to time with respect to certain accounts receivables, which arrangements are non-recourse to us in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit-related reasons, and are not included in our indebtedness. We could become obligated to repurchase such accounts receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangements under certain circumstances, such as where a commercial dispute arises between us and an account debtor. The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The indentures governing our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) and 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) contain various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things: • incur additional indebtedness; • pay dividends and make other restricted payments; • make certain investments, including investments in our unrestricted subsidiaries; • create or permit certain liens; • create or permit restrictions on the ability of certain restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us; • use the proceeds from sales of assets; • enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidate or merge or sell our assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety. In addition, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement restricts our ability to make cash payments on the notes to the extent that, on the date of such payment, a default or event of default exists under the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, or we have not had at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately preceding such payment, or would not have, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment, Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) of at least $50 million. Any of our future debt agreements may contain similar restrictions. If we fail to make any cash payment on a series of notes when required by the applicable indenture, it would constitute an event of default under such indenture, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. Our Secured Revolving Line of Credit also contains various covenants which limit our ability to, among other things, make certain investments, merge or consolidate with other entities and permit certain subsidiaries from incurring indebtedness. In addition, further restrictions apply when certain payment conditions (the Payment Conditions) are not satisfied with respect to specified transactions, events or payments. The Payment Conditions include that (i) no default or event of default exists and (ii) at all times during the 45 consecutive days immediately prior to such transaction, event or payment and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction, event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith, the Excess Cash Availability (as defined in the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement) available cash is greater than the greater of 15% of the total commitment amount and $75 million. If Payment Conditions are not satisfied under certain circumstances, we will become subject to various additional covenants which limit our ability to, among other things: • create liens upon any of the Loan Parties’ property (other than customary permitted liens and liens in respect of up to $1.5 billion of secured credit facilities debt, which amount includes our Secured Revolving Line of Credit); • declare or make cash distributions; • create any encumbrance on the ability of a subsidiary to make any upstream payments; • make asset dispositions other than certain ordinary course dispositions and certain supply chain finance arrangements; • make certain loans, make payments with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to its due date; and • enter into any non-arm’s-length transaction with an affiliate (except for certain customary exceptions). The agreements governing our notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, 19 the occurrence of a default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $50 million would cause a cross default under the indentures (to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness) governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes, as well as under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes or 2.125% Notes or the lenders under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. The markets in which our products are sold are very competitive and delivering the latest and best products to market on a timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth. We believe that the main factors that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introductions, product quality, product features and capabilities (including enabling state-of-the-art visual and virtual reality experiences), energy efficiency (including power consumption and battery life), reliability, processor clock speed, performance, size (or form factor), selling price, cost, adherence to industry standards (and the creation of open industry standards), level of integration, software and hardware compatibility, security and stability, brand recognition and availability. We expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological changes, frequent product introductions by our competitors or new competitors of products that may provide better performance/experience or may include additional features that render our products uncompetitive. We may also face aggressive pricing by competitors, especially during challenging economic times. In addition, our competitors have significant marketing and sales resources which could increase the competitive environment in such a declining market, leading to lower prices and margins. Some competitors may have greater access or rights to complementary technologies, including interface, processor and memory technical information. For instance, with our APU products and other competing solutions with integrated graphics, we believe that demand for additional discrete graphics chips and cards may decrease in the future due to improvements in the quality and performance of integrated graphics. If competitors introduce competitive new products into the market before us, demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, Intel Corporation has announced that it plans to expand its position in integrated graphics for the PC market with high-end discrete graphics solutions for a broad range of computing segments, which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segments. In addition, we are entering markets with current and new competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets or superior ability to anticipate customer requirements and emerging industry trends. We may face delays or disruptions in research and development efforts, or we may be required to invest significantly greater resources in research and development than anticipated. Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We maintain operations around the world, including in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Asia. We rely on third-party wafer foundries in Europe and Asia. Nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products is performed at manufacturing facilities, operated by third-party manufacturing facilities, in China, Malaysia and Taiwan. We also have international sales operations. International sales, as a percent of net revenue, were 80% in 2018. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. The political, legal and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include, without limitation: • expropriation; • changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions; • changes in tax laws, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; • difficulties in protecting our intellectual property; • difficulties in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practices and labor laws; • changes in foreign currency exchange rates; • restrictions on transfers of funds and other assets of our subsidiaries between jurisdictions; • changes in freight and interest rates; • disruption in air transportation between the United States and our overseas facilities; • loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs; and • compliance with U.S. laws and regulations related to international operations, including export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 20 In addition, our worldwide operations (or those of our business partners) could be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons and volcanic eruptions that disrupt manufacturing or other operations. For example, our Santa Clara operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in California. There may be conflict or uncertainty in the countries in which we operate, including public health issues (for example, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as avian influenza, measles or Ebola), safety issues, natural disasters, fire, disruptions of service from utilities, nuclear power plant accidents or general economic or political factors. For example, the United Kingdom’s 2016 referendum, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” has created economic and political uncertainty in the European Union. Also, the European Union ’ s General Data Protection Regulation imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. Also the United States administration has called for changes to domestic and foreign policy. The United States administration has announced tariffs on certain products imported into the United States with China as the country of origin, and we are taking steps to mitigate the impact of these tariffs on our business and AMD processor-based products. There is also a possibility of future tariffs imposed by the United States, China or other countries that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above risks, should they occur, could result in an increase in the cost of components, production delays, general business interruptions, delays from difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, tariffs and other barriers and restrictions, longer payment cycles, increased taxes, restrictions on the repatriation of funds and the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, any of which could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business. Our issuance to West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH) of warrants to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock, if and when exercised, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders, and the conversion of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. Pursuant to the sixth amendment to the WSA (Sixth Amendment), we issued warrants to WCH to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock. Any issuance by us of shares of our common stock to WCH upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market by WCH of any shares owned by WCH could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock, and the anticipated exercise by WCH of the warrants could depress the price of our common stock. On February 5, 2019, WCH sold approximately 34.9 million shares of our common stock and notified us it would exercise its warrant to purchase 75 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.98 per share for a total amount of $448.5 million . We expect to receive proceeds of $448.5 million upon the exercise of the warrant and issue the 75 million shares of our common stock to WCH in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement. Also, the conversion of some or all of the 2.125% Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. The 2.125% Notes will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by us or converted. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the sale price for conversion was satisfied as of the end of December 31, 2018 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2019. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the 2.125% Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short positions, or the anticipated conversion of the 2.125% Notes into cash and/or shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. We typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers’ estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. PC and consumer markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize, could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: • a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; • a production or design defect in our products; • a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; 21 • a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or • our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. A large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on the consumer desktop PC and notebook segments, which have in the past experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation ® 4, Sony PlayStation ® 4 Pro, Microsoft ® Xbox One™ S and Microsoft ® Xbox One™ X game console systems worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China and South Korea have instituted restrictions on cryptocurrency trading and the valuations of the currencies, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies, are subject to significant fluctuations. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property. In the design and development of new and enhanced products, we rely on third-party intellectual property such as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and greater functionality from semiconductor products may exceed the capabilities of the third-party intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality and performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software and other computer platform components to support our business. We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, graphics cards, software (e.g. BIOS, operating systems, drivers) and other components that our customers utilize to support and/or use our microprocessor, GPU and APU offerings. We also rely on our add-in-board (AIB) partners to support our GPU and APU products. In addition, our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with Intel microprocessors. If the designers, manufacturers, AIBs and suppliers of motherboards, graphics cards, software and other components decrease their support for our product offerings, our business could be materially adversely affected. If we lose Microsoft Corporation’s support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86 instruction set controlled by Intel depends partially on Microsoft designing and developing its operating systems to run on or support our x86-based microprocessor products. With respect to our graphics products, we depend in part on Microsoft to design and develop its operating system to run on or support our graphics products. Similarly, the success of our products in the market, such as our APU products, is dependent on independent software providers designing and developing software to run on our products. If Microsoft does not continue to design and develop its operating systems so that they work with our x86 instruction sets or does not continue to develop and maintain their operating systems to support our graphics products, independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations and customers may not purchase PCs with our products. In addition, some software drivers licensed for use with our products are certified by Microsoft. If Microsoft did not certify a driver, or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of Microsoft or other software vendors, our ability to market our products would be materially adversely affected. Our reliance on third-party distributors and AIB partners subjects us to certain risks. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors and AIB partners pursuant to agreements that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party. These agreements are non-exclusive and permit both our distributors and AIB partners to offer our competitors’ products. We are dependent on our distributors and AIB partners to supplement our direct marketing and sales efforts. If any significant distributor or AIB or a substantial number of our distributors or AIB partners terminated their relationship with us, decided to market our competitors’ products over our products or decided not to market our products at all, our ability to bring our products to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to collect accounts receivable from our significant distributors and/ 22 or AIB partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the use of our third-party distributors and AIB partners or offer appropriate incentives to focus them on the sale of our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, distributors and AIB partners typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances, our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions, as well as provide return rights for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than 12 months older than the manufacturing date. Some agreements with our distributors also contain standard stock rotation provisions permitting limited levels of product returns. Our agreements with AIB partners protect their inventory of our products against price reductions. In the event of a significant decline in the price of our products, the price protection rights we offer would materially adversely affect us because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline. We may incur future impairments of goodwill and technology license purchases. We perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. Subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we monitor for any events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate or operating results, changes in management’s business strategy, an inability to successfully introduce new products in the marketplace, an inability to successfully achieve internal forecasts or significant declines in our stock price, which may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future goodwill impairment charges. We license certain third-party technologies and tools for the design and production of our products. We report the value of those licenses as intangible assets on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those licenses based on their future economic benefit to us. Factors such as the life of the assets, changes in competing technologies, and changes to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment. The occurrence of any of these events may require us to record future technology license impairment charges. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded an impairment charge in Cost of sales of $45 million on technology licenses related to products that are no longer being used. Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business. Much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering, marketing, sales and executive personnel. Competition for highly skilled employees and executives in the technology industry is intense and our competitors have targeted our employees that have desired skills. If we are not able to continue to attract, train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business, the progress of our product development programs could be hindered, and we could be materially adversely affected. To help attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, we use share-based incentive awards such as employee stock options and non-vested share units (restricted stock units). If the value of such stock awards does not appreciate as measured by the performance of the price of our common stock, or if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, our ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel could be weakened, which could harm our results of operations. Also, if the value of our stock awards increases substantially, this could potentially create great personal wealth for our employees and affect our ability to retain these employees. In addition, any future restructuring plans may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees. In the event of a change of control, we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt as required by the applicable indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit, which would result in a default under the indentures and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. Upon a change of control, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes then outstanding at 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the repurchase date. In addition, a change of control would be an event of default under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. As of December 29, 2018, $70 million of borrowings were outstanding under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit, $26 million related to letters of credit under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit remained outstanding and $1.5 billion principal amount was outstanding under our notes. Future debt agreements may contain similar provisions. We may not have the financial resources to repurchase our outstanding notes and prepay all of our outstanding obligations under our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced significant downturns, often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change, wide fluctuations in supply and demand, continuous new product introductions, price erosion and declines in general economic conditions. We have incurred substantial losses in recent downturns, due to: • substantial declines in average selling prices; • the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry; • a decline in demand for end-user products (such as PCs) that incorporate our products; and 23 • excess inventory levels. Industry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. For example, a large portion of our Computing and Graphics revenue is focused on consumer desktop PC and notebook segments. While overall growth in Computing and Graphics is stabilizing, the areas within Computing and Graphics are changing. Our ability to take advantage of the opportunities within Computing and Graphics is based on foreseeing those changes and making timely investments in the form factors that serve those growing sub-segments. Global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market as consumers and businesses have deferred purchases, which negatively impacted demand for our products. Our financial performance has been, and may in the future be, negatively affected by these downturns. The growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our products from high-growth adjacent emerging global markets. Our ability to be successful in such markets depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure, as well as our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationships in these markets. If demand from these markets is below our expectations, sales of our products may decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on us. Acquisitions, divestitures and/or joint ventures could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute, or adversely affect the price of, our common stock. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies or through divestitures or joint ventures rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions or joint ventures. Moreover, if such acquisitions or joint ventures require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Even if we successfully complete an acquisition or a joint venture, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions or joint ventures which could harm our operating results. In addition, to complete an acquisition, we may issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders’ ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock, as well as incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or have amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions and joint ventures may also reduce our cash available for operations and other uses, which could harm our business. Also, any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiatives could adversely affect our business. We may not adequately assess the risk of new business initiatives and subsequent events may arise that alter the risks that were initially considered. Furthermore, we may not achieve the objectives and expectations with respect to future operations, products and services.The majority of our ATMP services are provided by the JVs and there is no guarantee that the JVs will be able to fulfill our long-term ATMP requirements. If we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the JVs, it could result in lost sales and have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from any new business initiatives. We have a joint venture with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly, Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd.) (THATIC), comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). We may not realize the expected benefits from this joint venture, including the THATIC JV’s expected future performance, the receipt of any future milestone payments from certain licensed intellectual property, and the receipt of any royalty payments from future sales of products by the THATIC JV. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to our business. Our business processes and information systems need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. As such, our information systems will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business needs. These changes may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees and third-party resources. We continuously work on simplifying our information systems and applications through consolidation and standardization efforts. There can be no assurance that our business and operations will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party information technology providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, viruses or malware, cyber- 24 attacks, data breaches and computer system or network failures, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business. In addition, as our IT environment continues to evolve, we are embracing new ways of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customers and partners using methods such as mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency. However, these practices can also result in a more distributed IT environment, making it more difficult for us to maintain visibility and control over internal and external users, and meet scalability and administrative requirements. If our security controls cannot keep pace with the speed of these changes, or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirements, our business would be materially adversely affected. If essential equipment, materials or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected. We may purchase equipment and materials for use by our back-end manufacturing service providers from a number of suppliers and our operations depend upon obtaining deliveries of adequate supplies of equipment and materials on a timely basis. Our third-party suppliers also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantities of equipment and materials in the manufacture of our products. In addition, as many of our products increase in technical complexity, we rely on our third-party suppliers to update their processes in order to continue meeting our back-end manufacturing needs. Certain equipment and materials that are used in the manufacture of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers, or in some cases, a sole supplier. We also depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for our microprocessors, including our APU products. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, printed circuit boards (PCBs), interposers, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of our products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Because some of the equipment and materials that we and our third-party manufacturing suppliers purchase are complex, it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Also, some of these materials and components may be subject to rapid changes in price and availability. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. Dependence on a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers exacerbates these risks. If we are unable to procure certain of these materials for our back-end manufacturing operations, or our third-party foundries or manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure materials for manufacturing our products, our business would be materially adversely affected. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Our products may not be fully compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. Further, we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner. If our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. Products as complex as those we offer may contain defects or failures when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released. We cannot assure you that, despite our testing procedures, errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future, which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, material recall and replacement costs, loss of revenue, writing down the inventory of defective products, the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts, defending against litigation related to defective products or related liabilities, including property damage, personal injury, damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property, and could adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, we may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field. As a result, we could incur substantial costs to implement modifications to correct defects. Any of these problems could materially adversely affect our business. We could be subject to potential product liability claims if one of our products causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury, whether tangible or intangible. Claims may be made by consumers or others selling our products, and we may be subject to claims against us even if an alleged injury is due to the actions of others. A product liability claim, recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or for amounts in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to meet customer demand for our products depends, in part, on our ability to deliver the products our customers want on a timely basis. Accordingly, we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing, distribution and fulfillment of our products. As we continue to grow our business, expand to high-growth adjacent markets, acquire new customers and strengthen relationships with existing customers, the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customers tend to have specific requirements for particular products, and specific time-frames in which they require delivery 25 of these products. If we are unable to consistently deliver the right products to our customers on a timely basis in the right locations, our customers may reduce the quantities they order from us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services. We rely on third-party providers to operate our regional product distribution centers and to manage the transportation of our work-in-process and finished products among our facilities, to our manufacturing suppliers and to our customers. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide certain information technology services to us, including help desk support, desktop application services, business and software support applications, server and storage administration, datacenter operations, database administration and voice, video and remote access. We cannot guarantee that these providers will fulfill their respective responsibilities in a timely manner in accordance with the contract terms, in which case our internal operations and the distribution of our products to our customers could be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot guarantee that our contracts with these third-party providers will be renewed, in which case we would have to transition these functions in-house or secure new providers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately. Our stock price is subject to volatility. Our stock price has experienced price and volume fluctuations and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future. The trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factors including, actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial conditions and operating results, changes in financial estimates by us or financial estimates and ratings by securities analysts, changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public, interest rate changes, news regarding our products or products of our competitors, and broad market and industry fluctuations. Stock price fluctuations could impact the value of our equity compensation, which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities. Worldwide political conditions may adversely affect demand for our products. Worldwide political conditions may create uncertainties that could adversely affect our business. The United States has been and may continue to be involved in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales and our supply chain. The consequences of armed conflict, political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have a material adverse effect on us. Terrorist attacks or other hostile acts may negatively affect our operations, or adversely affect demand for our products, and such attacks or related armed conflicts may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers. Furthermore, these attacks or hostile acts may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive, which could materially adversely affect us. Any of these events could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the United States economy and worldwide financial markets. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us. We have costs, assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies. As a consequence, movements in exchange rates could cause our foreign currency denominated expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue, affecting our profitability and cash flows. Whenever we believe appropriate, we hedge a portion of our short-term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We determine our total foreign currency exposure using projections of long-term expenditures for items such as payroll. We cannot assure you that these activities will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure. Failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, the majority of our product sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the local currency can cause increases or decreases in the cost of our products in the local currency of such customers. An appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products. Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. We market and sell our products directly to OEMs and through authorized third-party distributors. From time to time, our products are diverted from our authorized distribution channels and are sold on the “gray market.” Gray market products result in shadow inventory that is not visible to us, thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately. Also, when gray market products enter the market, we and our distribution channels compete with these heavily discounted gray market products, which adversely affects demand for our products and negatively impact our margins. In addition, our inability to control gray market activities could result in customer satisfaction issues because any time products are purchased outside our authorized distribution channels there is a risk that our customers are buying counterfeit or substandard products, including products that may have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or are used products represented as new. 26 If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks and common law rights, such as trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third-party infringement or from misappropriation in the United States and abroad. Any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or rights granted there under may not provide a competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, patent applications that we file may not result in issuance of a patent or, if a patent is issued, the patent may not be issued in a form that is advantageous to us. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights. In addition, it is difficult to monitor compliance with, and enforce, our intellectual property on a worldwide basis in a cost-effective manner. In jurisdictions where foreign laws provide less intellectual property protection than afforded in the United States and abroad, our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised, and our business would be materially adversely affected. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. From time to time, we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions. For example, as described in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements, we have been subject to certain claims concerning federal securities laws and corporate governance. Our products are purchased by and/or used by consumers, which could increase our exposure to consumer actions such as product liability claims and consumer class action claims, including those described in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements. On occasion, we receive claims that individuals were allegedly exposed to substances used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facilities and that this alleged exposure caused harm. Litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and its outcome is uncertain. It is possible that if a claim is successfully asserted against us, including the claims described in Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements, it could result in the payment of damages that could be material to our business. With respect to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we have been notified of, or third parties may bring or have brought, actions against us and/or against our customers based on allegations that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of others, contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others, improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others. If any such claims are asserted, we may seek to obtain a license under the third parties’ intellectual property rights. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. These parties may file lawsuits against us or our customers seeking damages (potentially up to and including treble damages) or an injunction against the sale of products that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business as presently conducted, which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our products or to increase the costs of selling some of our products or which could damage our reputation. The award of damages, including material royalty payments, or other types of damages, or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our products could have a material adverse effect on us. We could decide, in the alternative, to redesign our products or to resort to litigation to challenge such claims. Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming regardless of their merit, could cause delays in product release or shipment and/or could have a material adverse effect on us. We cannot assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities. The Company is subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. The United States federal government enacted significant tax reform, and certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Act) has resulted in significant changes to the United States corporate income tax system. These changes include a federal statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain domestic deductions and credits and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. The Tax Reform Act also transitions international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on non-U.S. earnings, which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to United States taxation. These changes became effective in 2018. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate income tax, indirect tax, or other tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot assure that the final 27 determination of any tax audits and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit, assessment or litigation, there could be a material adverse effect on our cash, tax provisions and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made. We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities. Our operations and properties have in the past been and continue to be subject to various United States and foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to materials used in our products and manufacturing processes, discharge of pollutants into the environment, the treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and remediation of contamination. These laws and regulations require our suppliers to obtain permits for operations making our products, including the discharge of air pollutants and wastewater. Although our management systems are designed to oversee our suppliers’ compliance, we cannot assure you that our suppliers have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If our suppliers violate or fail to comply with any of them, a range of consequences could result, including fines, suspension of production, alteration of manufacturing processes, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. Such non-compliance from our manufacturing suppliers could result in disruptions in supply, higher sourcing costs, and/or reputational damage for us. Environmental laws are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, the European Union (EU) and China are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted restrictions on the use of lead and other materials in electronic products. These regulations affect semiconductor devices and packaging. As regulations restricting materials in electronic products continue to increase around the world, there is a risk that the cost, quality and manufacturing yields of products that are subject to these restrictions may be less favorable compared to products that are not subject to such restrictions, or that the transition to compliant products may not meet customer roadmaps, or produce sudden changes in demand, which may result in excess inventory. A number of jurisdictions including the EU, Australia, California and China are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulations for computers and servers based on ENERGY STAR specifications as well as additional energy consumption limits. There is the potential for certain of our products being excluded from some of these markets which could materially adversely affect us. Certain environmental laws, including the United States Comprehensive, Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or the Superfund Act, impose strict or, under certain circumstances, joint and several liability on current and previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances and impose liability for damages to natural resources. These laws often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of, or was not responsible for, the release of such hazardous substances. These environmental laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. Such persons can be responsible for cleanup costs even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility. We have been named as a responsible party at three Superfund sites in Sunnyvale, California. Although we have not yet been, we could be named a potentially responsible party at other Superfund or contaminated sites in the future. In addition, contamination that has not yet been identified could exist at our other facilities. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted disclosure and reporting requirements for companies that use “conflict” minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries. We continue to incur additional costs associated with complying with these requirements, such as costs related to developing internal controls for the due diligence process, determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products, auditing the process and reporting to our customers and the SEC. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions are developing new policies focused on conflict minerals that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the subject minerals. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as “conflict free.” If we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor’s products. The United States federal government has issued new policies for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking. In addition, the United Kingdom, Australia and the State of California have issued laws that require us to disclose our policy and practices for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain. Several customers as well as the Responsible Business Alliance have also issued expectations to eliminate these practices that may impact us. While we have a policy and management systems to identify and avoid these practices in our supply chain, we cannot guarantee that our suppliers will always be in conformance to these laws and expectations. We may face enforcement liability and reputational challenges if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectations. Moreover, we are likely to encounter challenges with customers if we cannot satisfy their forced and trafficked labor polices and they may choose a competitor’s product. 28 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 29, 2018, we leased approximately 2.47 million square feet of space for research and development, engineering, administrative and warehouse use, including our headquarters in Santa Clara, California, our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas, our main facility with respect to graphics and chipset products located in Markham, Ontario, Canada and a number of smaller regional sales offices located in commercial centers near customers, principally in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia. These leases expire at varying dates through 2028, although some of these leases include optional renewals. We occupy 220,000 square feet of space in our headquarters in Santa Clara, California under a 10-year operating lease which commenced in August 2017. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional 5-year periods. The lease for our principal administrative facilities in Austin, Texas expires in March 2025, and provides for one 10-year optional renewal. The leases for our facilities in Markham, Ontario, Canada expire in February 2028, and provide for one 5-year optional renewals. We currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facilities through lease renewals prior to expiration or through month-to-month occupancy, or replacing them with equivalent facilities. We believe that our existing facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and that, the productive capacity of such facilities is substantially being utilized or we have plans to utilize such capacity. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual directors and officers regarding our 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on our 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against us and certain of our officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding our 32nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of our insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On January 30, 2018, the Wessels and Hamilton plaintiffs amended their complaints. On February 2, 2018, the Ha plaintiff also filed an amended complaint. On February 22, 2018, we filed motions to dismiss the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs’ amended complaints. On April 2, 2018, we filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the Wessels amended complaint. On July 23, 2018, the Santa Clara Superior Court sustained our demurrer in the Wessels case, dismissing all claims in that matter with prejudice. The Wessels plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints. The Hamilton plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 8, 2018, and the Ha plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2018. The Wessels, Hamilton, and Ha appeals are currently pending; the plaintiffs have not yet filed their opening briefs in any of the three matters. On November 19, 2018, the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary reversal of the order dismissing their claims. We opposed this motion on December 13, 2018, and it remains pending. 29 Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Kim Securities Litigation On January 16, 2018, a putative class action lawsuit captioned Kim et al. v. AMD, et al. , Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual officers for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock during the period February 21, 2017 through January 11, 2018. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual officers regarding a security vulnerability (Spectre), which statements and omissions, the plaintiff claims, allegedly caused our common stock price to be artificially inflated during the purported class period. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On August 3, 2018, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with similar allegations and shortening the class period to June 29, 2017 through January 11, 2018. We filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims on September 25, 2018, and plaintiffs filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on November 14, 2018. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Hauck et al. Litigation Since January 19, 2018, three putative class action complaints have been filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California: (1) Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc., Case No. 5:18-cv-0047, filed on January 19, 2018; (2) Brian Speck et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-0744, filed on February 4, 2018; and (3) Nathan Barnes and Jonathan Caskey-Medina, et al. v. AMD, Inc. , Case No. 5:18-cv-00883, filed on February 9, 2018. On April 9, 2018, the court consolidated these cases and ordered that Diana Hauck et al. v. AMD, Inc. serve as the lead case. On June 13, 2018, six plaintiffs (from California, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts) filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that we failed to disclose our processors’ alleged vulnerability to Spectre. Plaintiffs further allege that our processors cannot perform at their advertised processing speeds without exposing consumers to Spectre, and that any “patches” to remedy this security vulnerability will result in degradation of processor performance. The plaintiffs seek damages under several causes of action on behalf of a nationwide class and four state subclasses (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana) of consumers who purchased our processors and/or devices containing AMD processors. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees, equitable relief, and restitution. Pursuant to the court’s order directing the parties to litigate only eight of the causes of action in the consolidated amended complaint initially, we filed a motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018. On October 29, 2018, after the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed one of their claims, the court granted our motion and dismissed six causes of action with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint on December 6, 2018. On January 3, 2019, we again moved to dismiss the subset of claims currently at issue. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against us in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that we infringe two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that we infringe one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that we infringe two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against us; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, we filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Zeng Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On March 8, 2018, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Zeng v. Su, et al. , Case No. 18CIV01192 was filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the San Mateo County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for breach of 30 fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual directors and officers regarding Spectre, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. On April 26, 2018, the lawsuit was transferred to Santa Clara County and assigned a new case number, 18CV327692. On August 14, 2018, the Court stayed this lawsuit pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in Kim et al. v. AMD, et al. , Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In re Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation Two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against us (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of our directors and officers in the United States District Court, Northern District of California: (1) Jacqueline Dolby, derivatively on behalf of AMD, Inc. v. Su et al., Case No. 5:18-cv-03575, filed on June 14, 2018; and (2) Gusinsky Trust, derivatively on behalf of AMD, Inc. v. Su et al., Case No. 5:18-cv-03811, filed on June 26, 2018. The complaints purport to assert claims against us and certain individual directors and officers for violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek damages purportedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by us and the individual directors and officers regarding Spectre. The plaintiffs allege that these statements and omissions operated to artificially inflate the price paid for our common stock during the period. On July 12, 2018, the court consolidated the Dolby and Gusinsky Trust shareholder derivative lawsuits under the caption In re Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation. On August 10, 2018, the Court stayed this lawsuit pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in Kim et al. v. AMD, et al. , Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD , No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that we misled consumers by using the term “eight cores” in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on our “Bulldozer” core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees. On December 21, 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon our motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. On March 27, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. On January 17, 2019, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The class definition does not encompass our Ryzen TM or EPYC TM processors. On January 31, 2019, we filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of certain aspects of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. Based upon information presently known to management, we believe that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Environmental Matters We are named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, we have discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, we received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. We have entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. We remain responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. 31 To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and have not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. Costs could also increase as a result of additional test and remediation obligations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency or California Regional Water Quality Control Board. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Other Matters We are a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on our management’s current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not Applicable. 32 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “AMD”. On February 1, 2019, there were 4,614 registered holders of our common stock, and the closing price of our common stock was $24.51 per share as reported on NASDAQ. For information about our equity compensation plans, see Part III, Item 11, below.

Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. (3) During the third quarter of 2016, we agreed to pay GF $100 million in installments related to the Sixth Amendment with GF starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017. As of December 30, 2017, we paid GF $100 million in aggregate. In addition, in 2016 we recorded a charge of $340 million in Cost of sales, consisting of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement issued in consideration of the Sixth Amendment. (4) In 2015 and 2014, we implemented restructuring plans and incurred net charges of $53 million and $58 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which primarily consisted of severance and related employee benefits. (5) In 2015, we exited the dense server systems business, formerly SeaMicro resulting in a charge of $76 million in restructuring and other special charges, net. In 2014, we incurred other special charges of $13 million primarily related to the departure of a former CEO. (6) In 2014, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $233 million related to our Computing and Graphics segment. Also in 2014, we recorded a $58 million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment related to our second generation APU products. In 2015, we recorded an inventory write-down of $65 million, which was primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older-generation APUs, and a technology node transition charge of $33 million. (7) In 2016, we recorded a cumulative pre-tax gain on the sale of our 85% equity interest in ATMP JV of $146 million which was recognized in Other income (expense) on our consolidated statements of operations. (8) Total long-term debt and other long term liabilities decreased by $534 million from 2015 to 2016, primarily due to $1,048 million of net debt repayment, partially offset by the issuance of $805 million in principal amount of 2.125% Notes net of unamortized discount of $308 million and unamortized financing cost of $14 million, and $38 million increase in other long-term liabilities mainly due to higher technology licenses payable. (9) Amounts retrospectively reflected adoption of FASB ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs beginning in the first quarter of 2016. We reclassified debt issuance costs from long-term assets to long-term debt, net by $25 million and $30 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. 35 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 and for each of the three years in the period ended December 29, 2018 and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as with the other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Part I, Item 1: Business,” “Part II, Item 6: Selected Financial Data” and “Part II, Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Introduction We are a global semiconductor company primarily offering: • x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and • server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. We also license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio. In this management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A), we will describe the results of operations and the financial condition for us and our consolidated subsidiaries, including a discussion of our results of operations for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 , an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements. Overview Our 2018 financial results demonstrate the success of our strong product roadmap execution. Customers continued to adopt our high performance products as new products accounted for over 65% of our annual 2018 revenue. Net revenue for 2018 was $6.5 billion, an increase of 23% compared to 2017 net revenue of $5.3 billion. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2018, was 38%, a 4% increase compared to 34% in 2017. Our operating income for 2018 improved to $451 million compared to operating income of $127 million for 2017. Our net income for 2018 improved to $337 million compared to a net loss of $33 million in the prior year. We significantly expanded our desktop processor offerings in 2018 with the launch of our second-generation AMD Ryzen and high-end AMD Ryzen Threadripper™ WX processors for gamers, creators and hardware enthusiasts. We announced the availability of our first desktop consumer and commercial Ryzen and Ryzen PRO APUs that combine our high-performance “Zen” CPU and Radeon “Vega” graphics cores into a single chip. We also introduced the first entry-level processors based on our “Zen” CPU and “Vega” GPU cores for the consumer and commercial desktop PC market with the AMD Athlon™ and AMD PRO processors. In the notebook market, multiple customers launched premium consumer and commercial PCs featuring our mobile AMD Ryzen APUs, including our first enterprise-class notebooks powered by our new AMD Ryzen PRO APUs. For the high-performance embedded markets, we introduced the AMD EPYC™ Embedded 3000 processor and AMD Ryzen Embedded V1000 processor families that bring new levels of computing and graphics performance to the thin client, digital signage, and infrastructure markets. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 29, 2018 were $1.16 billion, down from $1.18 billion at the end of 2017. Principal amount of total debt as of December 29, 2018 was $1.53 billion, compared to $1.70 billion as of December 30, 2017. We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill impairments and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with 36 management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. Revenue recognition. In accordance with the adoption of the new revenue standard effective the beginning of the first quarter of 2018, we now recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributors (sell-in), rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributors to their customers (sell-through). Accordingly, we have established provisions for rights of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributors. Revenue Allowances. We record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales for estimated future price reductions and other customer incentives in the same period that the related revenues are recorded. We base these estimates on actual historical sales returns, historical allowances, historical price reductions, market activity and other known or anticipated trends and factors. These estimates are subject to management’s judgment and actual provisions could be different from our estimates and current provisions, resulting in future adjustments to our revenue and operating results. Inventory Valuation. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence based on projected sales outlook. This evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand. These projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory. In addition, we write off inventories that we consider obsolete. We adjust the remaining specific inventory balances to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or net realizable value. Among other factors, management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and realizable value. If in any period we anticipate future demand or market conditions to be less favorable than our previous estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made. This would have a negative impact on our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written down in a previous period, related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Goodwill. We perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. We first analyze qualitative factors. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Income Taxes. In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes. We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We consider past performance, future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authorities. If our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results, an additional tax benefit or charge will result. We recognize the interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. 37 In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. More specifically, SAB 118 allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As a result, we have recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. During 2018, we finalized our computation of the impact of the Tax Reform Act. In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) provisions of the Tax Reform Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. The guidance allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either (i) account for GILTI as a component of tax expense in the period in which they are subject to the rules (the period cost method), or (ii) account for GILTI in the Company’s measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). After completing the analysis of the GILTI provisions, we elected to account for GILTI using the period cost method. Results of Operations We report our financial performance based on the following two reportable segments:the Computing and Graphics segment and the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 15: Segment Reporting of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our operating results tend to vary seasonally. Historically, first quarter PC product sales were generally lower than fourth quarter sales and with respect to our semi-custom SoC products for game consoles our sales pattern usually reflects higher sales in the second and third quarters compared to the first and fourth quarters. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 4,125 $ 2,977 $ 1,988 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 2,350 2,276 2,331 Total net revenue $ 6,475 $ 5,253 $ 4,319 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 470 $ 92 $ (243 ) Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 163 132 287 All Other (182 ) (97 ) (417 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 451 $ 127 $ (373 ) Computing and Graphics Computing and Graphics net revenue of $4.1 billion in 2018 increased by 39% , compared to $3.0 billion in 2017 , primarily as a result of a 15% increase in average selling price and a 17% increase in unit shipments. The increase in average selling price and unit shipments was primarily driven by higher demand for our Ryzen™ processors. Computing and Graphics net revenue of $3.0 billion in 2017 increased by 50%, compared to $2.0 billion in 2016 as a result of a 38% increase in average selling price and a 1% increase in unit shipments. The increase in the average selling price was primarily driven by Ryzen desktop processor and Radeon graphics products sales. The increase in unit shipments was primarily attributable to higher demand for our Radeon graphics products. Computing and Graphics operating income was $470 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $92 million in 2017 . The improvement in operating income was primarily driven by higher demand for Ryzen and Radeon products as customers continued to adopt our new products, partially offset by a $195 million increase in operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. 38 Computing and Graphics operating income was $92 million in 2017 , compared to an operating loss of $243 million in 2016 . The improvement in operating results was primarily due to the increase in net revenue referenced above, partially offset by the related increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.4 billion in 2018 increased by 3% compared to net revenue of $2.3 billion 2017 . The increase in net revenue was primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC™ server products, partially offset by lower semi-custom revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom net revenue of $2.28 billion in 2017 decreased by 2% compared to net revenue of $2.33 billion in 2016 . IP related revenue and sales of our EPYC datacenter processors, which were launched in June of 2017, were mostly offset by a decrease in non-recurring engineering (NRE) revenue and lower sales of our semi-custom SoC products. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $163 million in 2018 compared to operating income of $132 million in 2017 . The improvement in operating income was due primarily to richer server and semi-custom product mix, partially offset by a $50 million increase in operating expenses and lower IP-related revenue. In 2017, operating income also included a licensing gain of $52 million. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income was $132 million in 2017 compared to operating income of $287 million in 2016 . The decline in operating results was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses driven primarily by datacenter-related expenses and lower licensing gain recorded in 2017 related to the licensed IP to the THATIC JV compared to 2016. Operating expenses increased for the reasons set forth under “Expenses” below. All Other All Other operating loss of $182 million in 2018 included stock-based compensation expense of $137 million and an impairment of technology licenses of $45 million . All Other operating loss of $97 million in 2017 was related to stock-based compensation expense. All Other operating loss of $417 million in 2016 included a charge of $340 million, which was comprised of the $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the $240 million value of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement with WCH, and stock-based compensation expense of $86 million, partially offset by restructuring reversals of $10 million. Comparison of Gross Margin, Expenses, Interest Expense, Other Income (Expense), Net Income Taxes and Equity Loss in Investee The following is a summary of certain consolidated statement of operations data for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 : 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except for percentages) Cost of sales $ 4,028 $ 3,466 $ 3,316 Gross margin 2,447 1,787 1,003 Gross margin percentage 38 % 34 % 23 % Research and development 1,434 1,196 1,008 Marketing, general and administrative 562 516 466 Restructuring and other special charges, net — — (10 ) Licensing gain — (52 ) (88 ) Interest expense (121 ) (126 ) (156 ) Other income (expense), net — (9 ) 80 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (9 ) 18 39 Equity loss in investee $ (2 ) $ (7 ) $ (10 ) Gross Margin Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 38% in 2018 compared to 34% in 2017 . The improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by the ramp of new products with higher gross margin than the corporate average. 39 Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 34% in 2017 compared to 23% in 2016 . Gross margin improved in 2017 primarily due to the absence of the charge of $340 million recorded in 2016, comprised of a $100 million payment under the Sixth Amendment and the value of the warrant of $240 million under the Warrant Agreement, which accounted for eight gross margin percentage points. In addition, the increase in gross margin percentage for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to a favorable shift in product mix to new Radeon GPU and Ryzen desktop processor products in the Computing and Graphics segment. Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses of $1.4 billion in 2018 increased by $238 million , or 20% , compared to $1.2 billion in 2017 . The increase was primarily driven by a $168 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Research and development expenses of $1.2 billion in 2017 increased by $188 million , or 19% , compared to $1.0 billion in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $136 million increase in product engineering and design related costs attributable to both segments, and higher annual employee incentives driven by improved financial performance. Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $562 million in 2018 increased by $46 million , or 9% , compared to $516 million in 2017 . The increase was primarily due to a $41 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance. Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $516 million in 2017 increased by $50 million , or 11% , compared to $466 million in 2016 . The increase was primarily due to a $29 million increase in sales and marketing activities attributable to both segments and higher annual employee incentives driven by our improved financial performance. Interest Expense Interest expense of $121 million in 2018 decreased by $5 million compared to $126 million in 2017 , primarily due to lower debt balances and lower weighted average interest rates . Interest expense of $126 million in 2017 decreased by $30 million compared to $156 million in 2016 , primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates and lower debt balances. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) , net of zero in 2018 changed by $9 million compared to $9 million Other expense , net in 2017 . The change from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to $12 million higher interest income in 2018 mainly related to a withholding tax refund from a foreign jurisdiction. Other expense, net of $9 million in 2017 changed by $89 million compared to $80 million Other income , net in 2016 . The change from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to the absence in 2017 of the substantial gain on sale of equity interests in ATMP JV that was partially offset by loss on debt redemption in 2016. Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes We recorded an income tax benefit of $9 million in 2018 and an income tax provision of $18 million and $39 million in 2017 and 2016 , respectively. The income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. The income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to withholding taxes applicable to IP-related revenue and licensing gains from foreign locations. The income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to a gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. 40 International Sales International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 80% in 2018 and 74% in 2017 . The increase in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from China and Taiwan related to sales of our products within the Computing and Graphics segment. International sales as a percentage of net revenue were 74% in 2017 and 79% in 2016 . The decrease in international sales as a percentage of net revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a higher proportion of revenue from domestic sales of our desktop processors, graphics processors and semi-custom SoC products. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total sales in the foreseeable future. Substantially all of our sales transactions were denominated in U.S. dollars. FINANCIAL CONDITION Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 29, 2018 , our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.16 billion compared to $1.18 billion as of December 30, 2017 . The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held domestically was 88% as of December 29, 2018 , and 95% as of December 30, 2017 . Our operating, investing and financing activities for fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 34 $ 12 $ 81 Investing activities (170 ) (54 ) 277 Financing activities 28 (33 ) 122 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash $ (108 ) $ (75 ) $ 480 Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance along with our Secured Revolving Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund operations, including capital expenditures, over the next 12 months. We believe we will be able to access the capital markets should we require additional funds. However, we cannot assure that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $34 million in 2018 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $12 million in 2017 . The increase in net cash provided in operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital, largely driven by higher cash collections from increased revenue, partially offset by higher labor costs and timing of accounts payable payments. Net cash provided by operating activities was $12 million in 2017 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $81 million in 2016 . The decrease in cash inflows from operating activities was primarily due to higher operating costs including higher wafer purchases and higher labor costs, partially offset by higher cash collection primarily due to higher revenue and lower interest payments resulting from debt reductions. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $170 million in 2018, which primarily consisted of $163 million for purchases of property and equipment, a net cash outflow from purchases and maturities of available-for-sale debt securities partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables. Net cash used in investing activities was $54 million in 2017, which consisted primarily of a cash outflow of $113 million for purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by collection of deferred proceeds on sale of receivables. Net cash provided by investing activities was $277 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of a net cash inflow of $342 million from sale of equity interests in the ATMP JV, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment . 41 Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $28 million in 2018, which consisted of a net cash inflow of $69 million from the issuance of common stock through employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by the repurchase of an aggregate principal amount of $40 million of our outstanding 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 (6.75% Notes) and 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 (7.00% Notes) for $41 million in cash. Net cash used in financing activities was $33 million in 2017, which primarily consisted of the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $103 million of our outstanding 6.75% Notes and 7.00% Notes for $110 million in cash and $13 million for tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock, partially offset by the $70 million net proceeds from our Secured Revolving Line of Credit and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans. Net cash provided by financing activities was $122 million in 2016, which primarily consisted of the $782 million net proceeds from the issuance of our 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2.125% Notes), the $667 million net proceeds from selling 115 million shares of our common stock and the $20 million proceeds from issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation equity plans, partially offset by the repurchases of an aggregate principal amount of $1.1 billion of our outstanding 6.75% Notes, 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (7.75% Notes), 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (7.50% Notes) and 7.00% Notes for $1.1 billion in cash and repayments in aggregate of $230 million of our Secured Revolving Line of Credit. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our consolidated principal contractual cash obligations, as of December 29, 2018 , and is supplemented by the discussion following the table: Payment due by period (In millions) Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter Term Debt $ 1,458 $ 66 $ — $ — $ 337 $ — $ 1,055 Secured Revolving Line of Credit 70 70 — — — — — Other long-term liabilities (1) 170 50 42 40 35 1 2 Aggregate interest obligation (2) 349 63 61 61 60 35 69 Operating leases 322 54 48 43 40 35 102 Purchase obligations (3) 337 287 29 15 4 2 — Obligations to GF (4) 2,435 1,200 715 520 — — — Total contractual obligations (5) $ 5,141 $ 1,790 $ 895 $ 679 $ 476 $ 73 $ 1,228 (1) Amounts largely represent future fixed and non-cancellable cash payments associated with software technology and licenses and IP licenses, including the payments due within the next 12 months. (2) Represents estimated aggregate interest obligations for our outstanding debt obligations that are payable in cash, excluding non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount. (3) We have purchase obligations for goods and services where payments are based, in part, on the volume or type of services we acquire. In those cases, we only included the minimum volume of purchase obligations in the table above. Purchase orders for goods and services that are cancellable upon notice and without significant penalties are not included in the amounts above. (4) Subsequent to the year end, on January 28, 2019, we entered into a Seventh Amendment with GF, which among other terms modified our minimum wafer purchase obligations to GF which are reflected in the above table. These minimum purchase obligations are our contractual minimums and do not necessarily reflect our actual expected expenditures, which could be significantly different. We cannot meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligations to GF beyond 2021 but expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material. (5) Total amount excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheets except for debt obligations and other liabilities related to software and technology licenses and IP licenses. 42 Senior Notes 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014, we issued $600 million of our 6.75% Notes. Our 6.75% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March 1, 2019. Our 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. At any time before March 1, 2019, we may redeem some or all of our 6.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 6.75% Indenture). In 2016, we repurchased $404 million in aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes pursuant to a partial tender offer for $442 million.

Prior to August 15, 2022, we may redeem some or all of our 7.50% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 7.50% Indenture). In 2014, we repurchased $25 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes. In 2016, we repurchased $125 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes. In 2017, we settled $3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes in treasury stock. During 2018, we settled $10 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes in treasury stock. As of December 29, 2018 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 7.50% Notes was $337 million. See Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.50% Notes. 7.00% Senior Notes Due 2024 On June 16, 2014, we issued $500 million of our 7.00% Notes. The 7.00% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations. Interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 of each year beginning January 1, 2015 until the maturity date of July 1, 2024.

Starting July 1, 2019, we may redeem our 7.00% Notes for cash at the following specified prices plus accrued and unpaid interest: Period Price as Percentage of Principal Amount Beginning on July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020 103.500% Beginning on July 1, 2020 through June 30, 2021 102.333% Beginning on July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2022 101.167% On July 1, 2022 and thereafter 100.000% In 2016, we settled $84 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes for $77 million in cash and $8 million with treasury stock. In 2017, we settled $105 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes for $84 million in cash and $26 million in treasury stock. During 2018 , we settled $61 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Notes for $26 million in cash and $35 million in treasury stock. As of December 29, 2018 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 7.00% Notes was $250 million . 43 See Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below, for additional information regarding our 7.00% Notes. During 2018, we recorded $12 million in losses on extinguishment of debt associated with the debt repurchases noted above. 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 On September 14, 2016, we issued $700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. We also granted an option to the underwriters to purchase up to an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. On September 28, 2016, this option was exercised in full and we issued an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes. Our 2.125% Notes are our general unsecured senior obligations and will mature on September 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest is payable in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning on March 1, 2017. Our 2.125% Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture and a supplemental indenture (together the 2.125% Indentures) dated September 14, 2016 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. Holders may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 1, 2026 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the conversion conditions were satisfied and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of 2019. We may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the notes. The conversion rate is initially 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. If we undergo a fundamental change prior to the maturity date of the notes, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of December 29, 2018 , the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2.125% Notes was $805 million . See Note 13 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” below for additional information regarding our 2.125% Notes. Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes We may elect to purchase or otherwise retire all or a portion of our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions, either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when we believe the market conditions are favorable to do so. Secured Revolving Line of Credit On April 14, 2015, we and our subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), ATI Technologies ULC (collectively with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties), a group of lenders and Bank of America N.A., acting as the agent for the lenders, entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, as amended (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit) that allows the Borrowers to borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings are limited up to a certain amount of eligible accounts receivable, as determined in accordance with the Agreement. The size of the commitment under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million. The commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are available through 44 March 21, 2022. The Borrowers are subject to commitment fees and letter of credit facility fees. The Loan Parties are required to comply with certain covenants under the Agreement. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit bears interest, at the option of the Borrowers, either at (a) a customary London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin (as determined in accordance with the agreement), or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the bank’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50%, and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00%, plus (ii) an applicable margin. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $70 million at an interest rate of 6.00% and 4.75%. respectively. As of December 31, 2016 , we had repaid an aggregate of $230 million of the Secured Revolving Line of Credit and we had no borrowings outstanding. As of December 29, 2018 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had $26 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $175 million available for future borrowings. We report intra-period changes in revolving credit balance on a net basis in our condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as we intend the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 29, 2018 , we were in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement. The agreements governing our 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and our Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. Operating Leases We lease certain of our facilities and in some jurisdictions we lease the land on which our facilities are built under non-cancellable lease agreements that expire at various dates through 2028. In addition, we lease certain office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years. Total future non-cancellable lease obligations as of December 29, 2018 were $322 million , including $259 million of future lease payments related to leases in Austin, Texas, Santa Clara, California, Markham, Canada, Singapore and Shanghai, China. During the second quarter of 2018, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy approximately 270,000 square feet of office space in Shanghai, China. Base rent payments commenced in October 2018 and the total estimated base rent payments over the life of the lease are approximately $72 million. As of December 29, 2018, the total estimate of future base rent over the life of the lease is approximately $68 million . In addition to the base rent payments, we are obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligations. We will also incur costs for capital projects for the new office space. During the third quarter of 2016, we entered into a 10-year operating lease to occupy 220,000 square feet of new office space in Santa Clara. The base rent obligation commenced in August 2017. As of December 29, 2018 , the total estimate of future base rent over the life of the lease is approximately $94 million , included in amounts above. In addition to the base rent payments, we will be obligated to pay certain customary amounts for our share of operating expenses and tax obligation. We will also incur costs for capital projects on the new office space. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for two additional five-year periods. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 29, 2018 , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 45 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long-term debt. We usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities or with frequent interest reset terms. Accordingly, our interest income fluctuates with short-term market conditions. As of December 29, 2018 , our investment portfolio consisted primarily of commercial paper. These investments were highly liquid. Due to the relatively short, weighted-average maturity of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment, our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal. As of December 29, 2018 , all of our outstanding long term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal. We will continue to monitor our exposure to interest rate risk. Default Risk. We mitigate default risk in our investment portfolio by investing in only high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor. Our portfolio includes investments in marketable debt securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity. We are averse to principal loss and strive to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk. We actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest. We believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest only in highly-rated debt securities with relatively short maturities and do not invest in securities which we believe involve a higher degree of risk. As of December 29, 2018 , substantially all of our investments in debt securities were A-rated by at least one of the rating agencies. While we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment-related risks, such risks cannot be fully eliminated as there are circumstances outside of our control. There were no significant sales of available-for-sale securities during 2018 . The following table presents the cost basis, fair value and related weighted-average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of December 29, 2018 : 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 and thereafter Total 2018 Fair Value (In millions, except for percentages) Investment Portfolio Cash equivalents: Fixed rate amounts $ 488 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 488 $ 488 Weighted-average rate 2.45 % — — — — — 2.45 % Variable rate amounts $ 312 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 312 $ 312 Weighted-average rate 2.29 % — — — — — 2.29 % Marketable securities Fixed rate amounts $ 78 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 78 $ 78 Weighted-average rate 2.77 % — — — — — 2.77 % Total Investment Portfolio $ 878 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 878 $ 878 Debt Obligations Fixed rate amounts $ 66 $ — $ — $ 337 $ — $ 1,055 $ 1,458 $ 2,494 Weighted-average effective interest rate 6.75 % — % — % 7.50 % — % 3.28 % 4.41 % Variable rate amounts $ 70 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 70 $ 70 Weighted-average effective interest rate 6.00 % — % — % — % — % — % 6.00 % Total Debt Obligations $ 136 $ — $ — $ 337 $ — $ 1,055 $ 1,528 $ 2,564 Foreign Exchange Risk. As a result of our foreign operations, we incur costs and we carry assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies, while sales of products are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We maintain a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of our exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying our strategy, from time to time we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses to the extent eligible 46 under the accounting rules and evaluate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. We also use, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. The following table provides information about our foreign currency forward contracts as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . All of our foreign currency forward contracts mature within 12 months.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal Years Ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 NOTE 1: Nature of Operations Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is a global semiconductor company. References herein to AMD or the Company mean Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Company primarily offers: (i) x86 microprocessors, as standalone devices or as incorporated into an accelerated processing unit (APU), chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), and professional GPUs; and (ii) server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products and technology for game consoles. We also license portions of our intellectual property (IP) portfolio. NOTE 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Fiscal Year . The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2018 , 2017 and 2016 ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. Fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 consisted of 52, 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company’s accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all significant inter-company accounts and transactions are eliminated. Use of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation and impairment of goodwill and deferred income taxes. Revenue Recognition. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value-added, and other taxes collected concurrently with the provision of goods or services are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with product sales are included in cost of sales. Nature of products and services The Company's microprocessors, chipsets, GPUs, professional graphics products, server and embedded processors, and SoC products may be sold as standard non-custom products, or custom products manufactured to customers’ specifications. Non-custom products: The Company transfers control and recognizes revenue when non-custom products are shipped to customers, which includes original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. Certain OEMs may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM agreements. The Company also sells to distributors under terms allowing the majority of distributors certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by them. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration under OEM and distributor arrangements and, accordingly, records a provision for product returns, allowances for price protection and rebates based on actual historical experience and any known events. The Company offers incentive programs to certain customers, including cooperative advertising, marketing promotions, volume based incentives and special pricing arrangements. Where funds provided for such programs can be estimated, the Company recognizes a reduction to revenue at the time the related revenue is recognized; otherwise, the Company recognizes such reduction to revenue at the later of when: i) the related revenue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where the Company reimburses a customer for a portion of the customer’s cost to perform specific product advertising or marketing and promotional activities, such amounts are recognized as a reduction to revenue unless they qualify for expense recognition. Custom products: Custom products which are associated with the Company’s Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom segment (semi-custom products), under non-cancellable purchases orders and have no alternative use to the Company at contract 54 inception, are recognized as revenue, based on the value of the inventory and expected margin, over the time of production of the products by the Company. Sales of semi-custom products are not subject to a right of return. Development and intellectual property licensing agreements: From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements with customers that combine the provision of development services and a license to the right to use the IP, which is deemed to be a single performance obligation. Accordingly, the Company recognizes revenue for the entire consideration of the arrangement upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer. Customers are generally required to pay for products and services within the Company’s standard contractual terms, which are typically net 30 to 60 days. The Company has determined that it does not have significant financing components in its contracts with customers. Refer to Note 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet Information for further information. Inventories. Inventories are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The Company fully reserves for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. The Company performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by the Company, additional inventory adjustments may be required . Goodwill. The Company performs its goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment. Qualitative factors include industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, share price trends and market capitalization and Company-specific events. The Company first analyzes qualitative factors. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the Company does not proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. A quantitative impairment analysis, if necessary, considers the income approach, which requires estimates of the present value of expected future cash flows to determine a reporting unit’s fair value. Significant estimates include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, discount rates, and future economic and market conditions. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value. Any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Commitments and Contingencies. From time to time the Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to income tax, indirect tax or other tax claims by tax agencies in jurisdictions in which it conducts business. In addition, the Company is a party to environmental matters including local, regional, state and federal government clean-up activities at or near locations where the Company currently or has in the past conducted business. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of reserves required for these commitments and contingencies that would be charged to earnings, if any, includes assessing the probability of adverse outcomes and estimating the amount of potential losses. The required reserves, if any, may change due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances such as a change in settlement strategy. Cash Equivalents. Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are primarily comprised of trade receivables that are recorded at the invoice amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable also include unbilled receivables, which primarily represent work completed on semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of amounts owed by customers. The allowance consists of known specific troubled accounts as well as an amount based on overall estimated potential uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience. 55 Investments in Available-for-sale Debt Securities . The Company classifies its investments in debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses and declines in the value of available-for-sale debt securities determined to be other than temporary are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The Company classifies investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of more than three months at the time of purchase as marketable securities on its consolidated balance sheet. Classification of these securities as current is based on the Company’s intent and belief in its ability to sell these securities and use the proceeds from sale in operations within 12 months. Derivative Financial Instruments. The Company maintains a foreign currency hedging strategy which uses derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This strategy takes into consideration all of the Company’s consolidated exposures. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. In applying its strategy, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted expenses denominated in foreign currencies. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted expenses, to the extent eligible under the accounting rules, and evaluates hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively. As such, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these contracts is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified to earnings in the same line item as the associated forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion is immediately recorded in earnings. The Company also uses, from time to time, foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge recognized foreign currency exposures on the balance sheets of various subsidiaries. The Company does not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments. Accordingly, the gain or loss associated with these contracts is immediately recorded in earnings. Property and Equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are as follows: equipment uses two to six years , and leasehold improvements are measured by the shorter of the remaining terms of the leases or the estimated useful economic lives of the improvements. Product Warranties. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may also offer one to three year limited warranties based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The Company accrues warranty costs to Cost of sales at the time of sale of warranted products. Foreign Currency Translation/Transactions. The functional currency of all of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars have been remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for non-monetary assets and liabilities. Non-U.S. dollar denominated transactions have been remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those cost of sales and expense transactions related to non-monetary balance sheet amounts which have been remeasured at historical exchange rates. The gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings. Subsidies. The Company received investment grants in connection with the construction and operation of certain facilities in Canada and Asia. Generally, such grants are subject to forfeiture in declining amounts over the life of the agreement if the Company does not maintain certain levels of employment or meet other conditions specified in the relevant grant documents. Accordingly, amounts granted are initially recorded as a receivable until cash proceeds are received. In the period the grant receivable is recorded, a current and long-term liability is also recorded which is subsequently amortized as a reduction to cost of sales. The Company also received grants relating to certain research and development projects. These research and development funds are generally recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses when all conditions and requirements set forth in the underlying grant agreement are met. Marketing and Advertising Expenses. Marketing and advertising expenses include cooperative advertising funding obligations under customer incentive programs, which costs are recorded upon agreement with customers and vendor partners. Cooperative advertising expenses are recorded as marketing, general and administrative expense to the extent the cash paid does not exceed the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received. Any excess of cash paid over the estimated fair value of the advertising benefit received is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Marketing and advertising expenses for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were approximately $176 million , $156 million and $131 million , respectively. 56 Stock-Based Compensation . The Company estimates stock-based compensation cost for stock options at the grant date based on the option’s fair-value as calculated by the lattice-binomial option-pricing model. For restricted stock units, including performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), fair value is based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of restricted stock units that involve a market condition using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for the compensation expense related to PRSUs, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Forfeiture rates are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Income Taxes. The Company computes the provision for income taxes using the liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using tax rates applicable to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled and provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will be realized. In addition, the Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it expects that its tax positions are more likely than not that they will be sustained, based on the technical merits of the positions, on examination by the jurisdictional tax authority. The Company recognizes any accrued interest and penalties to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Revenue from Contracts with Customers. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) , which creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies in all industries and replaces most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, the new standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has issued several amendments to the new standard, including clarification on accounting for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations. The Company adopted the new standard in the first quarter of 2018, using the full retrospective method, which required the Company to adjust prior reporting periods presented. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. The most significant impacts of the adoption of ASC 606 to the Company related to: (1) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales of semi-custom products subject to a non-cancellable customer purchase order, (2) the acceleration of revenue recognition for sales to distributors, and (3) the timing and financial statement classification of certain development and intellectual property licensing agreements. Revenue from sales of semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchases orders, and that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, is recognized, based on the value of the semi-custom products and expected margin, over the time of production of the semi-custom products by the Company, rather than upon shipment. Revenue from sales to the Company's distributors is recognized upon shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), net of provision for estimated reserves, instead of the previous revenue recognition which was upon the reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). For a development and IP licensing agreement executed in 2017, the Company recognized IP-related revenue in the third quarter of 2018 for the entire amount of arrangement consideration upon the completion of all the technology milestones. Previously, the agreement resulted in the reduction to research and development expenses in 2017 for development work as the expenses were incurred and would have resulted in licensing revenue to be recognized in periods beyond 2017 upon completion of the deliverables, based on a fair value allocation of the consideration received. Revenue recognition related to the Company’s other revenue streams remain substantially unchanged. The adoption of ASC 606 had an impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets, but had no impact on cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The impact on the Company’s 2017 and 2016 consolidated statement of operations as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: 57 Year Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions, except per share amounts) Net revenue (1) $ 5,329 $ (76 ) $ 5,253 $ 4,272 $ 47 $ 4,319 Cost of sales (1) 3,506 (40 ) 3,466 3,274 42 3,316 Gross margin 1,823 (36 ) 1,787 998 5 1,003 Research and development (2) 1,160 36 1,196 1,008 — 1,008 Marketing, general and administrative 511 5 516 460 6 466 Restructuring and other special charges, net — — — (10 ) — (10 ) Licensing gain (52 ) — (52 ) (88 ) — (88 ) Operating income (loss) 204 (77 ) 127 (372 ) (1 ) (373 ) Interest expense (126 ) — (126 ) (156 ) — (156 ) Other income (expense), net (9 ) — (9 ) 80 — 80 Income (loss) before equity loss and income taxes 69 (77 ) (8 ) (448 ) (1 ) (449 ) Provision for income taxes 19 (1 ) 18 39 — 39 Equity loss in investee (7 ) — (7 ) (10 ) — (10 ) Net income (loss) $ 43 $ (76 ) $ (33 ) $ (497 ) $ (1 ) $ (498 ) Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.04 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) $ — $ (0.60 ) Diluted $ 0.04 $ (0.07 ) $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) $ — $ (0.60 ) Shares used in per share calculation Basic 952 952 835 835 Diluted 1,039 952 835 835 (1) 2017 and 2016 revenue and cost of sales changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in channel and semi-custom product inventories, respectively. (2) 2017 Research and development expenses increased due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The impact on the Company’s affected 2017 and 2016 consolidated balance sheets line items, as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: Year Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions) Accounts receivable, net (1) $ 400 $ 54 $ 454 $ 311 $ 61 $ 372 Inventories, net (2) 739 (45 ) 694 751 (60 ) 691 Other current assets 188 3 191 109 6 115 Accrued liabilities 541 14 555 391 9 400 Other current liabilities (3) 57 35 92 69 — 69 Deferred income on shipments to distributors (4) 22 (22 ) — 63 (63 ) — Accumulated deficit (7,760 ) (15 ) (7,775 ) (7,803 ) 61 (7,742 ) (1) 2017 and 2016 Accounts receivable, net increased primarily due to the acceleration in timing of semi-custom product revenue. (2) 2017 and 2016 Inventories, net decreased primarily due to the acceleration in timing of semi-custom product revenue. 58 (3) 2017 Other current liabilities adjusted primarily due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. The credits are recorded as deferred revenue under the new standard. (4) 2017 and 2016 deferred income on shipments to distributors is eliminated due to the change in the revenue recognition model for sales to distributors, whereby revenue is recognized upon the shipment of the product to the distributors (sell-in), instead of upon reported resale of the product by the distributors to their customers (sell-through). The impact on the Company’s 2017 and 2016 net revenue and operating income (loss) by segments as a result of the adoption of the new standard is as follows: Year Ended December 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 As reported Adjustment As adjusted As reported Adjustment As adjusted (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics (1) $ 3,029 $ (52 ) $ 2,977 $ 1,967 $ 21 $ 1,988 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (2) 2,300 (24 ) 2,276 2,305 26 2,331 Total net revenue $ 5,329 $ (76 ) $ 5,253 $ 4,272 $ 47 $ 4,319 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics (3) $ 147 $ (55 ) $ 92 $ (238 ) $ (5 ) $ (243 ) Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (4) 154 (22 ) 132 283 4 287 All Other (97 ) — (97 ) (417 ) — (417 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 204 $ (77 ) $ 127 $ (372 ) $ (1 ) $ (373 ) (1) 2017 and 2016 Computing and Graphics revenue changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in channel inventory. (2) 2017 and 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom revenue changes were due to a net drain (decrease in revenue) or net build (increase in revenue) in semi-custom product inventory. (3) 2017 Computing and Graphics operating income decreased primarily due to the lower revenue from sales to distributors. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As Reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Computing and Graphics operating loss increased due to slightly higher operating expenses. (4) 2017 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income decreased primarily due to lower revenue from sales of semi-custom products. In addition, 2017 is lower due to the absence of credits to research and development expenses recognized for a certain development and intellectual property licensing agreement under the “As reported” standard, the entire amount of consideration was recognized as revenue in 2018 upon transfer of control of the IP license to the customer under the new standard. 2016 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom operating income increased due to higher revenue from sales of semi-custom products. Stock Compensation. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718): Scope of Modification Accounting (ASU 2017-09) to provide clarity and reduce both the (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when changing the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards. Under ASU 2017-09, modification accounting is required to be applied unless all of the following criteria are the same immediately before and after the change: 1. The award’s fair value (or calculated value or intrinsic value, if those measurement methods are used); 2. The award’s vesting conditions; and 3. The award’s classification as an equity or liability instrument. ASU 2017-09 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 on a prospective basis, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and the guidance did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (ASC 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (ASU 2016-16), which requires entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer 59 of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This amends current GAAP which prohibits recognition of current and deferred income taxes for all types of intra-entity asset transfers until the asset has been sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods therein. Upon adoption, the Company must apply a modified retrospective transition approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 and the guidance did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Statement of Cash Flows. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (ASC 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (ASU 2016-15), which is intended to reduce the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows, Restricted Cash (ASU 2016-18), which requires the inclusion of restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The amendments will be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-18 in 2018, which resulted in the additional presentation of restricted cash on the statement of cash flows for each period presented. The Company adopted ASU 2016-15 in 2018, which resulted in the reclassification of certain cash receipts from operating activities to investing activities on the statement of cash flows for each period presented. The adoption of these standards had no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments—Overall (ASC 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (ASU 2016-01), which requires that most equity investments be measured at fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also impacts financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Entities have to assess the realizability of such deferred tax assets in combination with the entities’ other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Intangibles. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (ASC 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract , which requires hosting arrangements that are service contracts to follow the guidance for internal-use software to determine which implementation costs can be capitalized. ASU 2018-15 is effective either prospectively or retrospectively for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating how to apply the new guidance. Reporting Comprehensive Income . In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (ASC 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act related to items in AOCI that the FASB refers to as having been stranded in AOCI. The new guidance may be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the Tax Reform Act is recognized in the period of adoption. The Company must adopt this guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued or made available for issuance, including the period the Tax Reform Act was enacted. The guidance, when adopted, will require new disclosures regarding a company’s accounting policy for releasing the tax effects in AOCI and permit the company the option to reclassify to retained earnings the tax effects resulting from the Tax Reform Act that are stranded in AOCI. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Derivatives and Hedging. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (ASU 2017-12), which amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to allow companies to more accurately present the economic effects of risk management activities in the financial statements. ASU 2017-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (ASC 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). The standard changes the methodology for measuring 60 credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and is currently evaluating the impact of this new standard on its consolidated financial statements. Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for lease recognition and disclosure. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statements in a manner similar to current guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company did not early adopt this standard and therefore the standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019. ASU 2016-02 requires that leases be recognized and measured as of the earliest period presented, using a modified retrospective approach, with all periods presented being adjusted and presented under the new standard. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases (ASC 842) : Targeted Improvements, which provides companies an optional adoption method to ASU 2016-02 whereby a company does not have to adjust comparative period financial statements for the new standard. The Company will adopt the new standard using the optional adoption method and thereby not adjust comparative financial statements. The Company is finalizing its implementation related to policies, processes and internal controls to comply with the guidance. The Company estimates that the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for the lease portfolio as of December 29, 2018 to be recorded on its consolidated balance sheet, as of December 30, 2018 to be within the range of $225 million to $275 million , primarily relating to real estate. No impact is expected to its consolidated statements of operations or its consolidated statement of cash flows. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, operating results or statements of cash flows. NOTE 3: GLOBALFOUNDRIES Wafer Supply Agreement. The Company and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA) in 2009, under which, among other terms, the Company would purchase wafers from GF. The WSA, which has been amended from time to time, governs the terms by which the Company purchases products manufactured by GF. Sixth Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement. On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the WSA (the WSA Sixth Amendment). The WSA Sixth Amendment modified certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for the Company’s microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five -year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. The Company and GF also agreed to establish a comprehensive framework for technology collaboration for the 7nm technology node. The WSA Sixth Amendment also provides the Company a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives the Company greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across its product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, the Company agreed to pay GF $100 million , to be paid in a series of installments starting in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017. The Company paid these installments in compliance with the agreement. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, the Company also agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. Further, for each calendar year during the term of the WSA Sixth Amendment, the Company and GF agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If the Company does not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, the Company will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the Company’s actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The annual targets were established based on the Company’s business and market expectations and took into account the limited waiver it received for certain products. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company met its respective annual wafer purchase targets. The Company and GF also agreed on fixed pricing for wafers purchased during 2016 and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. In 2018 and 2017 , the Company and GF had agreed on pricing for wafer purchases. The Company’s total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing, research and development activities and other for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $1.6 billion , $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion , respectively. Included in the total purchases for the year ended December 29, 2018 were amounts related to the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry, as agreed by the Company and GF under the WSA Sixth Amendment. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the amount of prepayment and receivables related to GF was $18 million and $27 million , respectively, included in Prepayment and receivables 61 - related parties on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the amount of payable to GF was $326 million and $241 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Seventh Amendment to Wafer Supply Agreement . On January 28, 2019, the Company entered into a seventh amendment (the Seventh Amendment) to the Wafer Supply Agreement with GF. The Seventh Amendment modifies certain purchase commitments, pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm technology node and above by the Company for the period commencing on January 1, 2019 and continuing through March 1, 2024. The Seventh Amendment also provides the Company with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to all products manufactured using 7nm and smaller technology nodes without any one-time payments or royalties by the Company to GF. Further, the Company and GF agreed to modify the annual wafer purchase targets previously agreed to in the WSA Sixth Amendment for years 2019 and 2020. The parties also agreed to an annual wafer purchase target for 2021 and agreed to pricing for wafers purchased for years 2019, 2020 and 2021. If the Company does not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, the Company will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the Company’s actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. The Company expects that its future purchases from GF will be material under the WSA, which is in place until March 1, 2024. Warrant Agreement. Also on August 30, 2016, in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the WSA Sixth Amendment, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with WCH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala. Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns are entitled to purchase 75 million shares of the Company’s common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. The warrant is exercisable in whole or in part until February 29, 2020. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Warrant Agreement will only be exercisable to the extent that Mubadala does not beneficially own, either directly or through any other entities directly and indirectly owned by Mubadala or its subsidiaries, an aggregate of more than 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding capital stock after any such exercise. GF continues to be a related party of the Company because Mubadala and Mubadala Tech are affiliated with WCH, a significant stockholder of the Company. GF, WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. On February 5, 2019, WCH notified the Company it would exercise its warrant to purchase 75 million shares of the Company’s common stock at a purchase price of $5.98 per share for a total amount of $448.5 million . The Company expects to receive proceeds of $448.5 million upon the exercise of the warrant and issue the 75 million shares of its common stock to WCH in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement. 62 NOTE 4: Equity Interest Purchase Agreement - ATMP Joint Venture In April 2016, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries completed the sale of a majority of the equity interests in Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (formerly, AMD Technologies (China) Co., Ltd.), and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. (formerly, Advanced Micro Devices Export Sdn. Bhd.), to affiliates of Tongfu Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (formerly, Nantong Fujitsu Microelectronics Co., Ltd.) (TFME), a Chinese joint stock company, to form two joint ventures (collectively, the ATMP JV). As a result of the sale, TFME’s affiliates own 85% of the equity interests in the ATMP JV while certain of the Company’s subsidiaries own the remaining 15% . The Company has no obligation to fund the ATMP JV. As a result of the transaction, the Company received approximately $342 million , including purchase price adjustments, in net cash proceeds for selling 85% of the equity interest in each of Suzhou TF-AMD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. and TF AMD Microelectronics (Penang) Sdn. Bhd. These proceeds, net of certain transaction costs, were included in investing activities on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company recognized a net pre-tax gain on the sale of its 85% equity interest in ATMP JV of $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recognized in Other income (expense), net on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The net pre-tax gain reflects the excess of the sum of net cash proceeds and fair value of the Company’s retained 15% equity interests in the ATMP JV over the sum of the net book values of the Company’s former subsidiaries and other closing costs directly attributed to the divestiture. The above gain includes $11 million in excess of fair value of the Company’s retained interest over the corresponding net book values. During 2017, the Company recorded a $3 million pre-tax gain for final settlement related to the sale of 85% of the equity interest in ATMP facilities in Other income (expense), net on its consolidated statements of operations. The Company accounts for its equity interests in the ATMP JV under the equity method of accounting due to its significant influence over the ATMP JV. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the carrying value of the Company’s investment in the ATMP JV was approximately $58 million and $58 million , respectively. The ATMP JV is a related party of the Company. The ATMP JV provides assembly, test, mark and packaging (ATMP) services to the Company. The Company currently pays the ATMP JV for ATMP services on a cost-plus basis. The Company assists the ATMP JV in its management of certain raw material inventory. The purchases from and resales back to the ATMP JV of the inventory under inventory management is reported within purchases and resales with the ATMP JV and does not impact the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company’s total purchases from the ATMP JV during 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $574 million and $438 million , respectively. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the amount payable to the ATMP JV was $207 million and $171 million , respectively, included in Payables to related parties on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s resales back to the ATMP JV during 2018 and 2017 amounted to approximately $62 million and $3 million , respectively. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the Company had receivables from ATMP JV of $16 million and $3 million , respectively, included in Prepayment and receivables - related parties on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

NOTE 5: Equity Joint Venture In February 2016, the Company and Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd. (formerly, Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co., Ltd.) (THATIC), a third-party Chinese entity (JV Partner), formed a joint venture comprised of two separate legal entities, China JV1 and China JV2 (collectively, the THATIC JV). The Company’s equity share in China JV1 and China JV2 is a majority and minority interest, respectively, funded by the Company’s contribution of certain of its patents. The JV Partner is responsible for the initial and on-going financing of the THATIC JV’s operations. The Company has no obligations to fund the THATIC JV. The Company concluded the China JV1 and China JV2 are not operating joint ventures and are variable interest entities due to their reliance on on-going financing by the JV Partner. The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of either China JV1 or China JV2, as the Company does not have unilateral power to direct selling and marketing, manufacturing and product development activities related to the THATIC JV’s products. Accordingly, the Company does not consolidate either of these entities and therefore accounts for its investments in the THATIC JV under the equity method of accounting. The THATIC JV is a related party of the Company. 63 In February 2016, the Company licensed certain of its intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of approximately $293 million in license fees payable over several years contingent upon achievement of certain milestones. The Company also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP. The Company also provided certain engineering and technical support to the THATIC JV in connection with the product development. In March 2017, the Company entered into a development and intellectual property agreement (Development and IP) with THATIC JV, and also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JV’s products to be developed on the basis of such agreement. In addition, from time to time the Company enters into certain agreements with the THATIC JV to provide other services primarily related to research and development. The Company recognized income related to the Licensed IP over the period commencing upon delivery of the first Licensed IP milestone through the date of the milestone that required the Company’s continuing involvement in the product development process, which was completed at the end of the second quarter of 2017. Royalty payments will be recognized in income once earned. The Company classifies Licensed IP income and royalty income associated with the February 2016 agreement as licensing gain within other operating income. During 2018 , the Company recognized $86 million of IP-related revenue upon completion of all technology milestones under the Development and IP agreement. During 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $52 million and $88 million , respectively, as licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP. The Company’s share in the net losses of the THATIC JV for 2018 was not material and is not recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations since the Company is not obligated to fund the THATIC JV’s losses in excess of the Company’s investment in the THATIC JV, which was zero as of December 29, 2018 . The Company’s receivable from the THATIC JV for these agreements was $18 million and $3 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively, included in Prepayment and receivables - related parties on its consolidated balance sheets. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material . NOTE 6: Supplemental Balance Sheet Information Accounts Receivable, net As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , Accounts receivable, net included unbilled accounts receivable of $308 million and $75 million , respectively. Unbilled receivables primarily represent work completed on semi-custom products under non-cancellable purchase orders that have no alternative use to the Company at contract inception, for which revenue has been recognized but not yet invoiced to customers. All unbilled accounts receivables are expected to be billed and collected within 12 months.

The unearned revenue is associated with any combination of development services, IP licensing and product revenue. Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) Beginning balance $ 85 $ 22 Unearned revenue 132 104 Revenue recognized during the period (186 ) (41 ) Other (20 ) — Ending balance $ 11 $ 85 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of December 29, 2018 is $95 million , which may include amounts received from customer but not yet earned and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods associated with any combination of development services, IP licensing and product revenue. The Company expects to recognize $78 million in the next 12 months, and the remainder thereafter. As permitted under ASC 606, the Company has not disclosed the comparative amounts as of December 30, 2017. 65 The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations did not include amounts which have an original expected duration of less than one year. NOTE 7: Goodwill Goodwill The carrying amount of goodwill as of both December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 was $289 million , which was fully allocated to the Company's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment. In the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017 , the Company conducted its annual impairment tests of goodwill. The Company determined that the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units, indicating that there was no goodwill impairment with respect to these reporting units. NOTE 8: Financial Instruments Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and financial instruments measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, which approximates amortized cost, as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 are summarized below: Total Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities (In millions) December 29, 2018 Cash $ 315 $ 315 $ — Level 1 (1) (2) Government money market funds $ 275 $ 275 $ — Total level 1 $ 275 $ 275 $ — Level 2 (1) (3) Commercial paper $ 566 $ 488 $ 78 Total level 2 $ 566 $ 488 $ 78 Total $ 1,156 $ 1,078 $ 78 Total Fair Value Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Marketable Securities (In millions) December 30, 2017 Cash $ 108 $ 108 $ — Level 1 (1) (2) Government money market funds $ 395 $ 395 $ — Total level 1 $ 395 $ 395 $ — Level 2 (1) (3) Commercial paper $ 682 $ 682 $ — Total level 2 $ 682 $ 682 $ — Total $ 1,185 $ 1,185 $ — (1) The Company did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2018 and 2017 . (2) The Company’s Level 1 assets are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. (3) The Company’s Level 2 assets are valued using broker reports that utilize quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active or comparable instruments in active markets. Brokers gather observable inputs for all of the Company’s fixed income securities from a variety of industry data providers and other third-party sources. 66 In addition to those amounts presented above, as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the Company had approximately $5 million and $2 million , respectively, of investments in money market funds used as collateral for letters of credit deposits which were included in Other current assets and Other assets, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These money market funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized costs are the same as the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these deposits. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the Company also had approximately $21 million and $18 million , respectively, of investments in mutual funds held in a Rabbi trust established for the Company’s deferred compensation plan which were also included in Other assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These mutual funds are classified within Level 1 because they are valued using quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Their amortized cost approximates the fair value for all periods presented. The Company is restricted from accessing these investments. Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis. The Company carries its financial instruments at fair value with the exception of its debt. Financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value are measured at fair value on a quarterly basis for disclosure purposes. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are as follows: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value Carrying Amount Estimated Fair Value (In millions) Short-term debt $ 136 $ 136 $ 70 $ 70 Long-term debt, net (1) $ 1,114 $ 2,428 $ 1,324 $ 2,103 (1) Carrying amounts of long-term debt are net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $16 million and $19 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively, and net of $262 million and $286 million unamortized debt discount associated with the 2.125% Notes as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. The Company’s short-term and long-term debt, net are classified within Level 2. The fair value of the debt was estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. The fair value of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and other short-term obligations approximate their carrying value based on existing payment terms. Hedging Transactions and Derivative Financial Instruments Cash Flow Hedges and Foreign Currency Forward Contracts not Designated as Hedges The following table shows the amount of gain (loss) included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), the amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) and included in earnings related to the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges and the amount of gain (loss) included in other income (expense), net, related to contracts not designated as hedging instruments which was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations: Consolidated Statements of Operations and Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Location 2018 2017 (In millions) Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - gains (losses) Contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments Other comprehensive income (loss) $ (14 ) $ 9 Gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into income Research and development (4 ) 7 Gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into income Cost of sales; Marketing, general and administrative (1 ) 1 Total Gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into income (5 ) 8 Contracts not designated as hedging instruments Gains (losses) recognized in income Other income (expense), net $ (3 ) $ (3 ) 67 The Company’s foreign currency derivative contracts are classified within Level 2 because the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments in active markets such as currency spot and forward rates. The following table shows the fair value amounts included in Other current assets should the foreign currency forward contracts be in a gain position or included in Other current liabilities should these contracts be in a loss position. These amounts were recorded in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as follows: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) Foreign Currency Forward Contracts - gains (losses) Contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments $ (7 ) $ 7 For the foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the ineffective portions of the hedging relationship and the amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness were immaterial. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the notional values of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were $396 million and $300 million , respectively. All the contracts mature within 12 months and, upon maturity, the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are expected to be reclassified into earnings. The Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions over a maximum of 12 months. NOTE 9: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Unrealized holding gains or losses on the Company’s available-for-sale securities and unrealized holding gains and losses on derivative financial instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges are included in other comprehensive income (loss). The table below summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017: Year Ended December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Total Unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges Total (In millions) Beginning balance $ — $ 6 $ 6 $ (1 ) $ (4 ) $ (5 ) Unrealized gains (losses) arising during the period — (19 ) (19 ) 1 17 18 Reclassification adjustment for gains realized and included in net income (loss) — 5 5 — (7 ) (7 ) Tax effect — — — — — — Total other comprehensive income (loss) — (14 ) (14 ) 1 10 11 Ending balance $ — $ (8 ) $ (8 ) $ — $ 6 $ 6 NOTE 10: Concentrations of Credit and Operation Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of investments in available-for-sale debt securities, trade receivables and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. The Company places its investments with high credit quality financial institutions and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution. The Company invests in time deposits and certificates of deposit from banks having combined capital, surplus and undistributed profits of not less than $200 million . At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1 or better. The Company invests in tax-exempt securities including municipal notes and bonds and bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral. The Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company’s customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. Accounts receivable from the Company’s top three customers accounted for approximately 16% , 12% and 7% of the total consolidated accounts 68 receivable balance as of December 29, 2018 and 15% , 13% and 11% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 30, 2017 . However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality. The Company manages its exposure to customer credit risk through credit limits, credit lines, ongoing monitoring procedures and credit approvals. Furthermore, the Company performs in-depth credit evaluations of all new customers and, at intervals, for existing customers. From this, the Company may require letters of credit, bank or corporate guarantees or advance payments if deemed necessary. The Company’s existing derivative financial instruments are with large international financial institutions of investment grade credit rating. The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counter-parties because the Company monitors their credit rating on an ongoing basis. By using derivative instruments, the Company is subject to credit and market risk. If a counter-party fails to fulfill its performance obligations under a derivative contract, the Company’s credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative instrument. Generally, when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counter-party owes the Company, thus creating a receivable risk for the Company. Based upon certain factors including a review of the credit default swap rates for the Company’s counter-parties, the Company determined its counter-party credit risk to be immaterial. At December 29, 2018 , the Company’s obligations under the contracts exceeded counter-parties' obligations by $8 million . The Company is dependent on certain equipment and materials from a limited number of suppliers and relies on a limited number of foreign companies to supply the majority of certain types of integrated circuit packages for back-end manufacturing operations. Similarly, certain non-proprietary materials or components such as memory, PCBs, substrates and capacitors used in the manufacture of the Company’s graphics products are currently available from only a limited number of sources. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials. If the Company or its third-party manufacturing suppliers are unable to procure certain of these materials or its foundries are unable to procure materials for manufacturing its products, its business would be materially adversely affected. NOTE 11: Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of: 2018 2017 (1) 2016 (1) (In millions) Current: U.S. Federal $ 12 $ (3 ) $ (2 ) U.S. State and Local — — — Foreign National and Local (17 ) 37 21 Total (5 ) 34 19 Deferred: U.S. Federal — (15 ) (1 ) Foreign National and Local (4 ) (1 ) 21 Total (4 ) (16 ) 20 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (9 ) $ 18 $ 39 (1) Prior year amounts adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Refer to Note 2. The income tax benefit in 2018 was primarily due to a $36 million refund of withholding tax from a foreign jurisdiction related to a legal settlement from 2010, offset by $13 million of U.S. income taxes resulting from the Tax Reform Act, $7 million tax provision in foreign locations and $7 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions. The income tax provision in 2017 was primarily due to withholding taxes applicable to IP-related revenue and licensing gains from foreign locations. The income tax provision in 2016 was primarily due to $41 million of foreign taxes in profitable locations including $27 million attributable to a gain on the sale of 85% of the ownership interest in the subsidiary operating a factory in Suzhou and $9 million of withholding taxes on cross-border transactions where no foreign tax credit is expected to be realizable, offset by $2 million of tax benefits for Canadian tax credits and the monetization of certain U.S. tax credits. Income (loss) before income taxes consists of the following: 69 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) U.S. $ 114 $ 53 $ (609 ) Foreign 214 (68 ) 150 Total pre-tax income (loss) including equity loss in investee $ 328 $ (15 ) $ (459 ) Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of tax carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the balances for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 are as follows: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (1) (In millions) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryovers $ 1,533 $ 1,551 Inventory valuation 25 20 Accrued expenses not currently deductible 98 61 Acquired intangibles 76 102 Tax deductible goodwill 25 56 Federal and state tax credit carryovers 527 546 Foreign research and development ITC credits 370 391 Other 89 62 Total deferred tax assets 2,743 2,789 Less: valuation allowance (2,580 ) (2,621 ) Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance 163 168 Deferred tax liabilities: Discount of convertible notes (54 ) (58 ) Undistributed foreign earnings (94 ) (97 ) Other (11 ) (13 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (159 ) (168 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 4 $ — (1) Prior year amounts adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Refer to Note 2. The breakdown between deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 is as follows: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (1) (In millions) Deferred tax assets $ 15 $ 11 Deferred tax liabilities (11 ) (11 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 4 $ — (1) Prior year amounts adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Refer to Note 2. Deferred tax assets are included in the caption Other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred tax liabilities are included in the caption Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform Act). The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a modified territorial tax system and imposing a transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. ASC 740: Income Taxes , requires companies to recognize the effect of the tax law changes 70 in the period of enactment. However, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period that is similar to the measurement period used when accounting for business combinations. As a result, in 2017, the Company provisionally adjusted its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets based upon the best available information at that time. In addition, the Company recognized the provisional tax impacts related to deemed repatriated earnings and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017. During 2018, the Company finalized its computation of the impact of the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) for tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2018. As a result, AMT credit carryforwards may be utilized to reduce future income tax liabilities. In addition, excess AMT credits are refundable in any taxable year beginning after 2017 and before 2022 in an amount equal to 50% (100% in the case of taxable years beginning in 2021) of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the taxable year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Accordingly, the Company recorded $16 million of AMT credit carry forwards as a tax receivable in 2017. As of December 29, 2018 , substantially all of the Company’s U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, continued to be subject to a valuation allowance. The realization of these assets is dependent on substantial future taxable income which at December 29, 2018 , in management’s estimate, is not more likely than not to be achieved. In 2018 , the net valuation allowance decreased by $43 million primarily for decreases related to net operating loss carryovers, federal and state tax credit carryovers, acquired intangibles and goodwill. In 2017 , gross deferred tax assets decreased by $1,018 million primarily for provisional decreases related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to the 21% tax rate under the Tax Reform Act, as well as decreases related to acquired intangibles and goodwill, offset by a decrease in the gross deferred tax liability balance of $112 million primarily for provisional decreases related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities due to the 21% tax rate under the Tax Reform Act, and a decrease in the gross valuation allowance of $905 million . In 2016 , the net valuation allowance decreased by $143 million primarily for increases in deferred tax assets related to foreign capitalized research costs, acquired intangibles and goodwill. The following is a summary of the Company’s various tax attribute carryforwards as of December 29, 2018 . Carryforward Federal State / Provincial Expiration (In millions) U.S.-net operating loss carryovers $ 7,140 $ 317 2018 to 2037 U.S.-credit carryovers $ 372 $ 219 2018 to 2037 Canada-net operating loss carryovers $ 17 $ 17 2027 to 2028 Canada-credit carryovers $ 338 $ 28 2023 to 2037 Other foreign net operating loss carryovers $ 44 N/A various Utilization of $6 million of the Company’s U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations as a result of the ATI Technologies ULC (ATI) acquisition. The table below displays the reconciliation between statutory federal income taxes and the total provision (benefit) for income taxes. 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Statutory federal income tax expense (benefit) at 21%, 35% and 35% rate $ 69 $ 22 $ (160 ) State taxes, net of federal benefit 1 1 1 Foreign (income) expense at other than U.S. rates 2 — (1 ) U.S. valuation allowance generated (utilized) (93 ) 15 201 Credit monetization (1 ) (20 ) (2 ) Tax Reform Act taxes 13 — — Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ (9 ) $ 18 $ 39 As part of the transition from a world-wide tax system to a territorial (dividend exemption) system, the Tax Reform Act imposes a one-time transition tax on the cumulative undistributed post-1986 earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries. The transition tax applies at a rate of 15.5% for earnings held as liquid assets and 8.0% for earnings held as illiquid assets by the foreign subsidiaries. 71 Because of the transition to a territorial system under the Tax Reform Act, the taxation of future dividend distributions by foreign subsidiaries is expected to be limited to withholding taxes which may apply based on the jurisdiction of the subsidiary. The Company has made no provision for taxes on approximately $142 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of December 29, 2018, and on approximately $117 million as of December 30, 2017, based on the Company’s intention to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. However, if such earnings were distributed, the Company would incur additional foreign withholding taxes. A reconciliation of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2018 2017 (1) 2016 (1) (In millions) Balance at beginning of year $ 49 $ 42 $ 38 Increases for tax positions taken in prior years 1 7 3 Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years (1 ) (2 ) — Increases for tax positions taken in the current year 3 3 2 Decreases for settlements with taxing authorities (2 ) — — Decreases for lapsing of the statute of limitations (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) Balance at end of year $ 49 $ 49 $ 42 (1) Prior year amounts adjusted to reflect the retrospective application of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Refer to Note 2. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the effective tax rate was $9 million , $9 million and $4 million as of December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 , respectively. The Company had no material amounts of accrued interest and accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as of December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months. However, the resolutions and/or closure of open audits are highly uncertain. The Company and its subsidiaries have several foreign, foreign provincial, and U.S. state audits in process at any one point in time. The Company has provided for uncertain tax positions that require a liability under the adopted method to account for uncertainty in income taxes. NOTE 12: Earnings (Loss) Per Share Earnings (Loss) Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, the assumed issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) and the assumed exercise of the warrant under the warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company PJSC (Mubadala). Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes) are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: 72 2018 2017 2016 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator—Net income (loss): Numerator for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 337 $ (33 ) $ (498 ) Denominator—Weighted average shares: Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share 982 952 835 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity incentive plans and warrants 82 — — Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share 1,064 952 835 Earnings (loss) per share: Basic $ 0.34 $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) Diluted $ 0.32 $ (0.03 ) $ (0.60 ) Potential shares from employee equity incentive plans and the conversion of the 2.125% Notes totaling 105 million shares for 2018 and potential shares from employee equity incentive plans, the conversion of the 2.125% Notes and the warrants under the Warrants Agreement totaling 189 million and 231 million shares for 2017 and 2016 , respectively, were not included in the diluted earnings (loss) per share calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. NOTE 13: Debt and Secured Revolving Line of Credit Debt The Company’s total debt as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 consisted of: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) 6.75% Notes $ 66 $ 166 7.50% Notes 337 347 7.00% Notes 250 311 2.125% Notes 805 805 Secured Revolving Line of Credit 70 70 Total debt (principal amount) 1,528 1,699 Unamortized debt discount associated with 2.125% Notes (262 ) (286 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs (16 ) (19 ) Other — 1 Total debt (net) 1,250 1,395 Less: current portion (136 ) (70 ) Total debt, less current portion $ 1,114 $ 1,325 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, the Company issued $805 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes). The 2.125% Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Company. The interest is payable semi-annually in March and September of each year, commencing in March 2017. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had $805 million principal amount outstanding. The 2.125% Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, as outlined in the indenture governing the 2.125% Notes, holders of the 2.125% Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar 73 quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 and until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The first event described in (1) above was met during the fourth quarter of 2018 and, as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from January 1, 2019 and remain convertible until March 31, 2019. The Company’s current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, no sinking fund is provided for the 2.125% Notes and the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125% Notes as permanent equity on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2018 . The determination of whether or not the 2.125% Notes are convertible is performed on a calendar-quarter basis. The 2.125% Notes consisted of the following: December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) Principal amounts: Principal $ 805 $ 805 Unamortized debt discount (1) (262 ) (286 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs (11 ) (12 ) Net carrying amount $ 532 $ 507 Carrying amount of the equity component, net (2) $ 305 $ 305 (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Long-term debt, net and amortized over the remaining life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of $9 million in equity issuance costs. As of December 29, 2018 , the remaining life of the 2.125% Notes was approximately 93 months . Based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock of $17.82 on December 28, 2018, the last trading day of 2018, the if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes exceeded its principal amount by approximately $988 million . The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes is 8% . This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125% Notes for the year ended December 29, 2018 : December 29, 2018 December 30, 2017 (In millions) Contractual interest expense $ 17 $ 17 Interest cost related to amortization of debt issuance costs 1 2 Interest cost related to amortization of the debt discount $ 24 $ 22 74 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014 , the Company issued $600 million of its 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 ( 6.75% Notes).

Interest is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year beginning September 1, 2014 until the maturity date of March 1, 2019 . The 6.75% Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the 6.75% Indenture) dated February 26, 2014 between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee.

At any time before March 1, 2019, the Company may redeem some or all of the 6.75% Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a “make whole” premium (as set forth in the 6.75% Indenture). Holders have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 6.75% Notes in the event that the Company undergoes a change of control, as defined in the 6.75% Indenture, at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, an event of default (as defined in the 6.75% Indenture) may result in the acceleration of the maturity of the 6.75% Notes. The 6.75% Indenture contains certain covenants that limit, among other things, the Company’s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries, to: • incur additional indebtedness, except specified permitted debt; • pay dividends and make other restricted payments; • make certain investments if an event of a default exists, or if specified financial conditions are not satisfied; • create or permit certain liens; • create or permit restrictions on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to the Company; • use the proceeds from sales of assets; • enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates; and • consolidate, merge or sell its assets as entirety or substantially as an entirety. 7.50% Senior Notes Due 2022 On August 15, 2012 , the Company issued $500 million of its 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 ( 7.50% Notes).

Potential Repurchase of Outstanding Notes The Company may elect to purchase or otherwise retire the 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes and 2.125% Notes with cash, stock or other assets from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions either directly or through intermediaries or by tender offer when the Company believes the market conditions are favorable to do so. Secured Revolving Line of Credit On April 14, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary, AMD International Sales & Service, Ltd. (together, the Borrowers), ATI Technologies ULC (collectively with the Borrowers, the Loan Parties), a group of lenders and Bank of America N.A., acting as the agent for the lenders, entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement, as amended (the Agreement). The Agreement provides for a secured revolving line of credit (the Secured Revolving Line of Credit) that allows the Borrowers to borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts from time to time up to $500 million with up to $45 million available for issuance of letters of credit, subject to certain conditions. Borrowings are limited up to a certain amount of eligible accounts receivable, as determined in accordance with the Agreement. The size of the commitment under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit may be increased by up to an aggregate amount of $200 million . The commitments under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit are available through March 21, 2022. The Borrowers are subject to commitment fees and letter of credit facility fees. The Loan Parties are required to comply with certain covenants under the Agreement. The Secured Revolving Line of Credit bears interest, at the option of the Borrowers, either at (a) a customary London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus an applicable margin (as determined in accordance with the agreement), or (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the bank’s prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York plus 0.50% , and (z) LIBOR for a one-month period plus 1.00% , plus (ii) an applicable margin. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had an outstanding loan balance of $70 million at an interest rate of 6.00% and 4.75% , respectively. As of December 29, 2018 , the Secured Revolving Line of Credit had $26 million related to outstanding letters of credit and up to $175 million available for future borrowings. The Company reports its intra-period changes in its revolving credit balance on a net basis in its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows as the Company intends the period of the borrowings to be brief, repaying borrowed amounts within 90 days. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company was in compliance with all required covenants stated in the Loan Agreement. The agreements governing the 6.75% Notes, 7.50% Notes, 7.00% Notes, 2.125% Notes and the Secured Revolving Line of Credit contain cross-default provisions whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the applicable note holders or the lenders under the Secured Revolving Line of Credit to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. 77 Future Payments on Total Debt As of December 29, 2018 , the Company’s future debt payment obligations for the respective fiscal years were as follows: Term Debt (Principal only) (In millions) 2019 $ 66 2020 — 2021 — 2022 337 2023 — 2024 and thereafter 1,055 Total $ 1,458 NOTE 14: Other Income (Expense), Net The following table summarizes the components of Other income (expense), net: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Interest income $ 18 $ 6 $ 2 Gain on sale of 85% ATMP JV — 3 146 Loss on debt redemption (12 ) (12 ) (68 ) Other (6 ) (6 ) — Other income (expense), net $ — $ (9 ) $ 80 78 NOTE 15: Segment Reporting Management, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss) before interest, other income (expense), net, income taxes and equity loss of investee. These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the operating segments based on management’s judgment. The Company has the following two reportable segments: • the Computing and Graphics segment, which primarily includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete and integrated graphics processing units (GPUs), professional GPUs and licensing portions of its IP portfolio; and • the Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, which primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services, technology for game consoles and licensing portions of its IP portfolio. In addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because management does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. Also included in this category are employee stock-based compensation expense, the charge related to the WSA Sixth Amendment and restructuring and other special charges, net. The Company also reported the results of former businesses in the All Other category because the operating results were not material. The following table provides a summary of net revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 . 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Net revenue: Computing and Graphics $ 4,125 $ 2,977 $ 1,988 Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 2,350 2,276 2,331 Total net revenue $ 6,475 $ 5,253 $ 4,319 Operating income (loss): Computing and Graphics $ 470 $ 92 $ (243 ) Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom 163 132 287 All Other (182 ) (97 ) (417 ) Total operating income (loss) $ 451 $ 127 $ (373 ) The following table provides major items included in All Other category: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Operating loss: Stock-based compensation expense $ (137 ) $ (97 ) $ (86 ) Restructuring and other special charges, net — — 10 Impairment of technology licenses (45 ) — — Charge related to the WSA Sixth Amendment — — (340 ) Other — — (1 ) Total operating loss $ (182 ) $ (97 ) $ (417 ) The Company does not discretely allocate assets to its operating segments, nor does management evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. 79 The Company’s operations outside the United States include research and development activities and sales, marketing and administrative activities. The Company conducts product and system research and development activities for its products in the United States with additional design and development engineering teams located in China, Canada, India, Singapore, Australia and Taiwan. The Company’s ATMP facilities located in Malaysia and China were sold in the second quarter of 2016 (see Note 4: Equity Interest Agreement - ATMP Joint Venture). The Company’s material sales and marketing offices are located in the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia.

NOTE 16: Common Stock and Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans Common Stock During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed its registered underwritten public offering of 115 million shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a public offering price of $6.00 per share pursuant to an underwriting agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as representatives of the several underwriters named therein. The resulting aggregate net proceeds to the Company from the common stock offering were approximately $667 million , after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses totaling approximately $23 million . Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans The Company’s stock-based incentive programs are intended to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified employees. On April 29, 2004, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan). 80 Under the 2004 Plan, stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a three -year period from the date of grant and expire within ten years after the grant date. Unvested shares that are reacquired by the Company from forfeited outstanding equity awards become available for grant and may be reissued as new awards. Under the 2004 Plan, the Company can grant fair market value awards or full value awards. Fair market value awards are awards granted at or above the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Full value awards are awards granted at less than the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Awards can consist of (i) stock options granted at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and (ii) restricted stock units as full value awards. The following is a description of the material terms of the awards that may be granted under the 2004 Plan. Stock Options. A stock option is the right to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a fixed exercise price for a fixed period of time. Under the 2004 Plan, nonstatutory and incentive stock options may be granted. The exercise price of the shares subject to each nonstatutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are awards that can be granted to any employee, director or consultant and that obligate the Company to issue a specific number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the future if the vesting terms and conditions are satisfied. The purchase price for the shares is $0.00 per share. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units (PRSUs) can be granted to certain of the Company’s senior executives. The performance metrics can be financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market condition. Each PRSU award reflects a target number of shares (Target Shares) that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on the Company’s financial performance, non-financial performance and/or market conditions. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 250% of the Target Shares granted, depending upon the degree of achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company has introduced the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under the ESPP, eligible employees who participate in an offering period may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld, up to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last business day of the six -month offering period. The offering periods commence in November and May each year. As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had 40 million shares of common stock that were available for future grants and 38 million shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or the vesting of unvested restricted stock units. In addition, the Company had 45 million shares of common stock that were available for issuance under the ESPP. Valuation and Expense Stock-based compensation expense related to employee stock options, restricted stock units, including PRSUs and the ESPP, was allocated in the consolidated statements of operations as follows: 2018 2017 2016 (In millions) Cost of sales $ 4 $ 2 $ 2 Research and development 91 57 49 Marketing, general, and administrative 42 38 35 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax of $0 $ 137 $ 97 $ 86 During 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , the Company did no t realize any excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and therefore the Company did not record any related financing cash flows. 81 Stock Options. The Company uses the lattice-binomial model in determining the fair value of the stock options. The weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted for the years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $7.62 , $5.46 and $3.10 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2018 2017 2016 Expected volatility 51.51% - 60.46% 57.26 % 62.33 % Risk-free interest rate 2.20% - 2.83% 1.68 % 1.02 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected life (in years) 3.92 - 3.94 3.92 3.98 The Company uses a combination of the historical volatility of its common stock and the implied volatility for publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock as the expected volatility assumption required by the lattice-binomial model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate for a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve with a term that approximates the expected life of the option grant at the date closest to the option grant date. The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company does not expect to pay dividends in the future. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted-average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding and is a derived output of the lattice-binomial model. The following table summarizes stock option activity and related information: Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted- Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) (In millions, except share price) Balance as of December 30, 2017 17 $ 4.32 $ 104 3.75 Granted 1 $ 18.35 Canceled — $ 8.93 Exercised (5 ) $ 4.65 Balance as of December 29, 2018 13 $ 5.33 $ 152 3.49 Exercisable December 29, 2018 11 $ 3.64 $ 145 3.15 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised for 2018 , 2017 and 2016 was $67 million , $27 million and $10 million , respectively.

As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to RSUs that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 1.75 years . 82 PRSUs. The Company uses the Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of grant in determining the fair value of the PRSUs with a market condition. The weighted-average grant date fair values of PRSUs granted during 2018 , 2017 and 2016 were $21.67 , $17.18 and $9.00 , respectively, using the following assumptions: 2018 2017 2016 Stock price at valuation date $12.02 - $32.72 $12.83 $5.14 Expected volatility 63.77% - 67.97% 64.39 % 57.83 % Risk-free interest rate 2.06% - 2.82% 1.50 % 0.88 % Expected dividends — % — % — % Expected term (in years) 2.48 - 3.00 3.00 3.07 The following table summarizes PRSU activity and related information: (Shares in millions) Unvested shares as of December 30, 2017 3 Granted 3 Forfeited — Vested (4 ) Unvested shares as of December 29, 2018 2 ESPP. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model in determining the fair value of the ESPP. The weighted-average grant date fair value for the ESPP during 2018 and 2017 was within a range from $3.42 to $6.43 and $3.46 per share, respectively, using the following assumptions: 2018 2017 Expected volatility 45.88% - 66.66% 56.07 % Risk-free interest rate 2.05% - 2.52% 1.36 % Expected dividends — % — % Expected term (in years) 0.49 - 0.50 0.49 During 2018 , 2.2 million and 2.5 million shares of common stock were purchased in each of the two six -month offering periods under the ESPP at a purchase price of $9.57 and $10.31 per share, respectively, resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of $47 million . As of December 29, 2018 , the Company had $9 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to the ESPP that will be recognized over the weighted-average period of 0.36 years .

In these limited matters, the Company has agreed to hold certain third parties harmless against specific types of claims or losses such as those arising from a breach of representations or covenants, third-party claims that the Company’s products when used for their intended purpose(s) and under specific conditions infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party, or other specified claims made against the indemnified party. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim and indemnification provision. Historically, payments made by the Company under these obligations have not been material. 85 NOTE 19: Contingencies Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits (Wessels, Hamilton and Ha) On March 20, 2014, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Wessels v. Read, et al. , Case No. 1:14 cv-262486 (Wessels) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the Santa Clara County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” product, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for the Company's common stock during the period. On April 27, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Christopher Hamilton and David Hamilton v. Barnes, et al. , Case No. 5:15-cv-01890 (Hamilton) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On September 29, 2015, a similar purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Jake Ha v Caldwell, et al., Case No. 3:15-cv-04485 (Ha) was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The lawsuit also seeks a court order voiding the stockholder vote on the Company's 2015 proxy. The case was transferred to the judge handling the Hamilton Lawsuit and is now Case No. 4:15-cv-04485. The Wessels, Hamilton and Ha shareholder derivative lawsuits were stayed pending resolution of a class action lawsuit captioned Hatamian v. AMD, et al. , C.A. No. 3:14-cv-00226 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (the Hatamian Lawsuit). The Hatamian Lawsuit asserted claims against the Company and certain of its officers for alleged violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and SEC Rule 10b-5 concerning certain statements regarding its 32nm technology and “Llano” products. On October 9, 2017, the parties signed a definitive settlement agreement resolving the Hatamian Lawsuit and submitted it to the Court for approval. Under the terms of this agreement, the settlement was funded entirely by certain of the Company's insurance carriers and the defendants continued to deny any liability or wrongdoing. On March 2, 2018, the court approved the settlement and entered a final judgment in the Hatamian Lawsuit. On January 30, 2018, the Wessels and Hamilton plaintiffs amended their complaints. On February 2, 2018, the Ha plaintiff also filed an amended complaint. On February 22, 2018, the Company filed motions to dismiss the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs’ amended complaints. On April 2, 2018, the Company filed a demurrer seeking to dismiss the Wessels amended complaint.

The Wessels plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on September 27, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Federal Court issued an order dismissing the Hamilton and Ha amended complaints. The Hamilton plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 8, 2018, and the Ha plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal on October 15, 2018. The Wessels, Hamilton, and Ha appeals are currently pending; the plaintiffs have not yet filed their opening briefs in any of the three matters. On November 19, 2018, the Hamilton and Ha plaintiffs filed a motion seeking summary reversal of the order dismissing their claims. The Company opposed this motion on December 13, 2018, and it remains pending. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Kim Securities Litigation On January 16, 2018, a putative class action lawsuit captioned Kim et al. v. AMD, et al. , Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual officers for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. The plaintiff seeks to represent a proposed class of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company's common stock during the period February 21, 2017 through January 11, 2018. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual officers regarding a security vulnerability (Spectre), which statements and omissions, the plaintiff claims, allegedly caused the Company's common stock price to be artificially inflated during the purported class period. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On August 3, 2018, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with similar allegations and shortening the class period to June 29, 2017 through January 11, 2018.

On June 13, 2018, six plaintiffs (from California, Louisiana, Florida, and Massachusetts) filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that the Company failed to disclose its processors’ alleged vulnerability to Spectre. Plaintiffs further allege that the Company's processors cannot perform at their advertised processing speeds without exposing consumers to Spectre, and that any “patches” to remedy this security vulnerability will result in degradation of processor performance. The plaintiffs seek damages under several causes of action on behalf of a nationwide class and four state subclasses (California, Florida, Massachusetts, Louisiana) of consumers who purchased the Company's processors and/or devices containing AMD processors. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees, equitable relief, and restitution. Pursuant to the court’s order directing the parties to litigate only eight of the causes of action in the consolidated amended complaint initially, the Company filed a motion to dismiss on July 13, 2018. On October 29, 2018, after the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed one of their claims, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed six causes of action with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint on December 6, 2018. On January 3, 2019, the Company again moved to dismiss the subset of claims currently at issue. Based upon information presently known to management, The Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, the Company filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Su, et al. , Case No. 18CIV01192 was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the San Mateo County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets.

Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD , No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that the Company misled consumers by using the term “eight cores” in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on the Company’s “Bulldozer” core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys’ fees. On December 21, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon the Company’s motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company’s motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. On March 27, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. On January 17, 2019, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. The class definition does not encompass the Company’s Ryzen TM or EPYC TM processors. On January 31, 2019, the Company filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking review of certain aspects of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Environmental Matters The Company is named as a responsible party on Superfund clean-up orders for three sites in Sunnyvale, California that are on the National Priorities List. Since 1981, the Company has discovered hazardous material releases to the groundwater from former underground tanks and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three sites. The chemicals released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the United States in the wafer fabrication process prior to 1979. In 1991, the Company received Final Site Clean-up Requirements Orders from the California Regional Water Quality Control Board relating to the three sites. The Company has entered into settlement agreements with other responsible parties on two of the orders. During the term of such agreements, other parties have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable costs as well as the primary role in conducting remediation activities under the orders. The Company remains responsible for additional costs beyond the scope of the agreements as well as all remaining costs in the event that the other parties do not fulfill their obligations under the settlement agreements. To address anticipated future remediation costs under the orders, the Company has computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately $3 million and has not recorded any potential insurance recoveries in determining the estimated costs of the cleanup. The progress of future remediation efforts cannot be predicted with certainty and these costs may change. The Company believes that any amount in addition to what has already been accrued would not be material. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, based on the management’s current knowledge, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 88 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California February 8, 2019 90 Supplementary Financial Information (unaudited) (1) The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed with the objective of providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. As of December 29, 2018 , the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). This type of evaluation is performed on a quarterly basis so that conclusions of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concerning the effectiveness of the disclosure controls can be reported in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K. The overall goals of these evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and to modify them as necessary. We intend to maintain the disclosure controls as dynamic systems that we adjust as circumstances merit. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management has used the 2013 framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control—Integrated Framework” published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 29, 2018 at the reasonable assurance level. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 , which is included in Part II, Item 8, above. 92 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
