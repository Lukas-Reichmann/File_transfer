Such materials may be found by inquiring of the Commission‘s EDGAR search page www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html using CPS's ticker symbol, which is ""CPSS."" Risk factors that should be considered are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,"" of CPS’s most recent annual report on Form 10 - K and subsequent reports on Form 10 - Q, which reports are on file with the Commission and available for review at the Commission's website. Such description of risk factors is incorporated herein by reference.  Forward - looking statements in this presentation include the Company's recorded figures representing allowances for remaining expected lifetime credit losses, its markdown of carrying value for the portion of its portfolio accounted for at fair value, its charge to the provision for credit losses for its legacy portfolio, its estimates of fair value (most significantly for its receivables accounted for at fair value), its entries offsetting the preceding, its anticipated credit facility capacity, and figures derived from any of the preceding. In each case, such figures are forward - looking statements because they are dependent on the Company’s estimates of cash to be received and losses to be incurred in the future. The accuracy of such statements may be adversely affected by various factors, which include (in addition to risks relating to the economy generally) the following: possible increased delinquencies; repossessions and losses on retail installment contracts; incorrect prepayment speed and/or discount rate assumptions; possible unavailability of qualified personnel, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to service its portfolio; possible increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Company’s rights to collect payments from its portfolio; other changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; possible declines in the market price for used vehicles, which could adversely affect the Company’s realization upon repossessed vehicles; economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; and a default under any credit facility debt agreement which, if not waived could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness and impair the Company’s ability to secure additional financing. Any or all of such factors also may affect the Company’s future financial results, as to which there can be no assurance. Any implication that past results or past consecutive earnings are indicative of future results or future earnings is disclaimed, and the reader should draw no such inference. Factors such as those identified above in relation to losses to be incurred in the future may affect future performance. -;-",0000889609,CPSS,"8-K:UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON DC 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported) December 11, 2023 (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation) (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) Registrant's telephone number, including area code ( 949 ) 753-6800 Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions (see General Instruction A.2. below): ☐ Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) ☐ Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) Securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act: Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is an emerging growth company as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (§230.405 of this chapter) or Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (§240.12b-2 of this chapter).

Risk factors that should be considered are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,"" of CPS’s most recent annual report on Form 10 - K and subsequent reports on Form 10 - Q, which reports are on file with the Commission and available for review at the Commission's website. Such description of risk factors is incorporated herein by reference.  Forward - looking statements in this presentation include the Company's recorded figures representing allowances for remaining expected lifetime credit losses, its markdown of carrying value for the portion of its portfolio accounted for at fair value, its charge to the provision for credit losses for its legacy portfolio, its estimates of fair value (most significantly for its receivables accounted for at fair value), its entries offsetting the preceding, its anticipated credit facility capacity, and figures derived from any of the preceding. In each case, such figures are forward - looking statements because they are dependent on the Company’s estimates of cash to be received and losses to be incurred in the future. The accuracy of such statements may be adversely affected by various factors, which include (in addition to risks relating to the economy generally) the following: possible increased delinquencies; repossessions and losses on retail installment contracts; incorrect prepayment speed and/or discount rate assumptions; possible unavailability of qualified personnel, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to service its portfolio; possible increases in the rate of consumer bankruptcy filings, which could adversely affect the Company’s rights to collect payments from its portfolio; other changes in government regulations affecting consumer credit; possible declines in the market price for used vehicles, which could adversely affect the Company’s realization upon repossessed vehicles; economic conditions in geographic areas in which the Company's business is concentrated; and a default under any credit facility debt agreement which, if not waived could result in acceleration of the related indebtedness and impair the Company’s ability to secure additional financing. Any or all of such factors also may affect the Company’s future financial results, as to which there can be no assurance. Any implication that past results or past consecutive earnings are indicative of future results or future earnings is disclaimed, and the reader should draw no such inference. Factors such as those identified above in relation to losses to be incurred in the future may affect future performance. "

Non-GAAP operating income was $240 million compared to $186 million a year ago and $111 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily due to higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment. • Net income was $120 million compared to $102 million a year ago and $35 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $219 million compared to $150 million a year ago and $92 million in the prior quarter. • Diluted earnings per share was $0.11 compared to $0.09 a year ago and $0.03 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.18 compared to $0.13 a year ago and $0.08 in the prior quarter. • Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary • Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 36 percent year-over-year and sequentially. Higher revenue was primarily driven by increased Ryzen client processor sales. • Client processor average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year primarily driven by Ryzen desktop processor sales and increased quarter-over-quarter driven by both Ryzen desktop and mobile processor sales. • GPU ASP increased year-over-year driven by higher channel sales and decreased quarter-over-quarter due to a higher proportion of mobile sales. • Operating income was $179 million compared to $100 million a year ago and $22 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher revenue. • Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $525 million, down 27 percent year-over-year and 11 percent sequentially. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue, partially offset by higher EPYC processor sales. 2 • Operating income was $61 million, compared to $86 million a year ago and $89 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. • All Other operating loss was $54 million compared to $36 million a year ago and $52 million in the prior quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) on investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, the Company also included a loss contingency on legal matter in the three months ended June 29, 2019 and the nine months ended September 28, 2019. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. All periods presented conform to the current period presentation. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 12 -;-EX-99.2:EX-99.2 3 amdq319earningsslides4b2.htm EXHIBIT 99.2 amdq319earningsslides4b2 THIRD QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS OCTOBER 29, 2019 1 | AMD Q3 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | OCTOBER 29, 2019 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT This presentation contains forward-looking statements concerning Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables at the end of AMD’s earnings press release. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this presentation should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Q3’19 year-to-date average stock price of $27.55 was assumed for the FY’19 estimate. (3) The dilutive impact of the warrant to purchase 75 million shares (Warrant) granted in 2016 to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company PJSC, West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in consideration for limited waiver and rights under the sixth amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. is based on the Treasury Stock method and is dependent upon the average stock price during the period. The Warrant was exercised, and common stock shares were issued on February 13, 2019. Therefore, Q1'19 and FY'19 includes the dilutive impact through the date of exercise. (4) The dilutive impact from the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2026 Convertible Notes) is based on the If-Converted method, where the interest costs associated with the 2026 Convertible Notes are added back to the Net Income and the shares underlying the 2026 Convertible Notes are assumed to be converted and are added to the share count. The impact from the 2026 Convertible Notes, if dilutive, is included in diluted EPS calculation. For the GAAP computation, the add-back to net income includes cash and non-cash interest expense, while only the cash interest expense is added back to non-GAAP net income. The dilutive shares associated with the 2026 Convertible Notes reflect the weighted average shares subject to conversion during each period. During Q3’19, 16 million shares of the Company’s common stock were issued to convert $126 million of the outstanding 2026 Convertible Notes. Moving forward, assuming positive earnings per share, the potential factors we expect may impact AMD's diluted share count include: • On-going employee equity grants, and • The 2026 Convertible Notes, which has 85 million underlying shares. 24 | AMD Q3 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | OCTOBER 29, 2019 APPENDICES Total Debt (Net) (Millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 Q2'18 Q3'18 Q4'18 Q1'19 Q2'19 Q3'19 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 $ 166 $ 153 $ 153 $ 66 $ 66 $ — $ — $ — 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 347 347 347 337 337 312 312 312 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 311 311 310 310 250 176 176 96 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 805 805 805 805 805 805 805 679 Borrowings from secured revolving line of credit, net 70 70 70 70 70 70 — — Total Debt (principal amount) $ 1,699 $ 1,686 $ 1,685 $ 1,588 $ 1,528 $ 1,363 $ 1,293 $ 1,087 Unamortized debt discount associated with 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (286) (280) (274) (268) (262) (256) (250) (205) Unamortized debt issuance costs (19) (19) (18) (17) (16) (13) (12) (10) Other 1 1 — — — — — — Total Debt (net) $ 1,395 $ 1,388 $ 1,393 $ 1,303 $ 1,250 $ 1,094 $ 1,031 $ 872 25 | AMD Q3 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | OCTOBER 29, 2019 DISCLAIMERS AND ATTRIBUTIONS The information contained herein is for informational purposes only, and is subject to change without notice.

Non-GAAP operating income was $240 million compared to $186 million a year ago and $111 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily due to higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment. • Net income was $120 million compared to $102 million a year ago and $35 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $219 million compared to $150 million a year ago and $92 million in the prior quarter. • Diluted earnings per share was $0.11 compared to $0.09 a year ago and $0.03 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.18 compared to $0.13 a year ago and $0.08 in the prior quarter. • Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.2 billion at the end of the quarter. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary • Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.28 billion, up 36 percent year-over-year and sequentially. Higher revenue was primarily driven by increased Ryzen client processor sales. • Client processor average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year primarily driven by Ryzen desktop processor sales and increased quarter-over-quarter driven by both Ryzen desktop and mobile processor sales. • GPU ASP increased year-over-year driven by higher channel sales and decreased quarter-over-quarter due to a higher proportion of mobile sales. • Operating income was $179 million compared to $100 million a year ago and $22 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher revenue. • Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $525 million, down 27 percent year-over-year and 11 percent sequentially. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue, partially offset by higher EPYC processor sales. 2 • Operating income was $61 million, compared to $86 million a year ago and $89 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. • All Other operating loss was $54 million compared to $36 million a year ago and $52 million in the prior quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other income (expense), net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, equity income (loss) on investee, stock-based compensation, and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, the Company also included a loss contingency on legal matter in the three months ended June 29, 2019 and the nine months ended September 28, 2019. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. All periods presented conform to the current period presentation. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 12 "

Q2 2019 PR Highlights • AMD launched its highly anticipated client and graphics processors based on advanced new architectures and leading-edge 7nm process technology. ◦ The “Zen 2” CPU core delivers up to an estimated 15 percent instructions per clock (IPC) uplift over the “Zen” architecture, outperforming the historical generational performance improvement industry trend. ◦ AMD Ryzen Desktop Processors are available now with up to 12 cores and 24 threads based on the new “Zen 2” core architecture to deliver leadership performance for gamers, creators and everyday PC users. ▪ AMD unveiled the new X570 chipset for AMD Socket AM4, enabling the world’s first PCIe® 4.0 ready platform for consumers. Motherboard manufacturers are expected to introduce more than 50 models using the new AMD X570 chipset by year end, creating the widest selection of motherboards at launch in AMD history. ◦ AMD introduced RDNA, a new foundational gaming architecture designed to drive the future of PC, console and cloud gaming. RDNA provides up to 1.25X higher performance-per-clock and up to 1.5X higher performance-per-watt compared to AMD’s previous generation Graphics Core Next architecture. ◦ AMD Radeon™ RX 5700 series graphics cards, built on the new AMD RDNA gaming architecture , deliver superior visual fidelity, performance and advanced features for the latest AAA and eSports titles at their respective price points. • AMD announced that it is working with Cray, the U.S. Department of Energy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build what is expected to be the world’s fastest supercomputer - Frontier. Based on future-generation high performance custom AMD EPYC CPUs and Radeon Instinct GPUs optimized for artificial intelligence (AI), Frontier is expected to deliver greater than 1.5 exaflops of processing performance. • 2 nd Gen EPYC processors are advancing the use of AI across diverse research fields on Indiana University’s Cray Shasta™ supercomputer. • Microsoft announced that AMD will power its upcoming next generation game console, codenamed Project Scarlett, with a custom, high performance SoC combining the AMD Ryzen “Zen 2” CPU core 3 and a next generation GPU based on the Radeon RDNA gaming architecture including hardware-accelerated ray tracing. • Samsung and AMD announced a multi-year strategic partnership through which Samsung will license AMD graphics IP to advance graphics technologies and solutions for mobile applications including smartphones. • Apple announced an all-new Mac Pro featuring AMD Radeon Pro Vega II GPUs that deliver exceptional computational performance by harnessing the power of the 7nm process technology, “Vega” graphics architecture and AMD Infinity Fabric™ Link GPU interconnect technology. • Acer announced the upcoming availability of the new Acer Nitro 5 and Swift 3 laptops, based on 2 nd Gen AMD Ryzen Mobile processors, adding to the more than 40 new consumer and commercial notebooks based on the latest Ryzen Mobile and Ryzen Mobile PRO processors launched this year from all leading global OEMs. Current Outlook AMD’s outlook statements are based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions and the factors set forth under “Cautionary Statement” below. For the third quarter of 2019, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.8 billion, plus or minus $50 million, an increase of approximately 18 percent sequentially and approximately 9 percent year-over-year. The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales. AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 43 percent in the third quarter of 2019. For full year 2019, AMD now expects revenue to increase a mid-single digit percent over 2018 driven by significant sales growth of our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processors, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom revenue. Revenue excluding semi-custom is expected to grow approximately 20 percent year over year. AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 42 percent for 2019.

These non-GAAP financial measures reflect certain adjustments as presented in the tables in this earnings press release. AMD has also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP operating income for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, the Company also included a loss contingency on legal matter in the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and the three months ended March 30, 2019. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest income and expense and income taxes that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. All periods presented conform to the current period presentation. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 12 -;-EX-99.2:EX-99.2 3 q219financialresultspres.htm EXHIBIT 99.2 q219financialresultspres SECOND QUARTER 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS JULY 30, 2019 1 | AMD Q2 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | JULY 30, 2019 CAUTIONARY STATEMENT This presentation contains forward-looking statements concerning Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(2) The adjustment in the three months ended March 30, 2019 represents a reduction of US taxes due to the completion of certain internal tax structuring. The associated tax benefit on a Non-GAAP basis is being recognized throughout 2019. (3) Q4'17 Non-GAAP diluted EPS calculations do not include 100.6 million shares related to the Company’s 2026 Convertible Notes and the associated interest expense add-back to Non-GAAP net income because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive under the ""if-converted' method. 25 |AMD Q2 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | July 30, 2019 APPENDICES Share Count Overview Shares (millions) (1) Q1'19 Q2'19 Q3'19 FY'19 Actual Actual Estimate Estimate Basic Shares 1,044 1,084 1,093 1,081 Dilutive impact from: Employee Equity Grants (2) 23 25 19 21 75 million share Warrant (3) 27 — — 7 Diluted Shares (without 2026 Convertible Notes) 1,094 1,109 1,112 1,109 2026 Convertible Notes (4) 101 101 101 101 Diluted Shares (with 2026 Convertible Notes) 1,195 1,210 1,213 1,210 The table above provides an estimate of share count that may be used when calculating GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q3`19 and FY'19. (Q1’19 and Q2'19 are actual share count) (1) Share counts are weighted average shares. (2) The dilutive impact of employee equity grants is based on the Treasury Stock method and is dependent upon the average stock price during the period. Q1’19 and Q2'19 average stock price was $22.63 and $28.53, respectively. The Q2'19 average stock price of $28.53 was assumed for Q3'19 and FY’19 estimates. (3) The dilutive impact of the warrant to purchase 75 million shares (Warrant) granted in 2016 to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mubadala Investment Company PJSC, West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), in consideration for limited waiver and rights under the sixth amendment to our Wafer Supply Agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. is based on the Treasury Stock method and is dependent upon the average stock price during the period. The Warrant was exercised and common stock shares were issued on February 13, 2019. Therefore, Q1'19 and FY'19 includes the dilutive impact through the date of exercise. (4) The dilutive impact from the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (2026 Convertible Notes) is based on the If-Converted method, where the interest costs associated with the 2026 Convertible Notes are added back to the Net Income and the 100.6 million shares underlying the 2026 Convertible Notes are assumed to be converted and are added to the share count. The impact from the 2026 Convertible Notes, if dilutive, is included in diluted EPS calculation. For the GAAP computation, the add-back to net income includes cash and non-cash interest expense, while only the cash interest expense is added back to non- GAAP net income. Moving forward, assuming positive earnings per share, the potential factors we expect may impact AMD's diluted share count include: • On-going employee equity grants, and • The 2026 Convertible Notes, which has 100.6 million underlying shares. 26 |AMD Q2 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | July 30, 2019 APPENDICES Total Debt (Net) (Millions) Q4'17 Q1'18 Q2'18 Q3'18 Q4'18 Q1'19 Q2'19 6.75% Senior Notes due 2019 $ 166 $ 153 $ 153 $ 66 $ 66 $ — $ — 7.50% Senior Notes due 2022 347 347 347 337 337 312 312 7.00% Senior Notes due 2024 311 311 310 310 250 176 176 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 805 805 805 805 805 805 805 Borrowings from secured revolving line of credit, net 70 70 70 70 70 70 — Total Debt (principal amount) $ 1,699 $ 1,686 $ 1,685 $ 1,588 $ 1,528 $ 1,363 $ 1,293 Unamortized debt discount associated with 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (286) (280) (274) (268) (262) (256) (250) Unamortized debt issuance costs (19) (19) (18) (17) (16) (13) (12) Other 1 1 — — — — — Total Debt (net) $ 1,395 $ 1,388 $ 1,393 $ 1,303 $ 1,250 $ 1,094 $ 1,031 27 |AMD Q2 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS | July 30, 2019 ENDNOTES Slide 19: AMD ""Zen 2"" CPU-based system scored an estimated 15% higher than previous generation AMD “Zen” based system using estimated SPECint®_base2006 results.

Revenue was up 20 percent quarter-over-quarter due to higher revenue in both segments. • Gross margin was 41 percent, up 4 percentage points year-over-year, primarily driven by increased Ryzen TM and EPYC TM processor sales. Gross margin was flat quarter-over-quarter. • Operating income was $59 million compared to $153 million a year ago and $38 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP operating income was $111 million compared to $186 million a year ago and $84 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower revenue and higher operating expenses. • Net income was $35 million compared to $116 million a year ago and $16 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $92 million compared to $156 million a year ago and $62 million in the prior quarter. • Diluted earnings per share was $0.03, compared to $0.11 a year ago and $0.01 in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.08, compared to $0.14 a year ago and $0.06 in the prior quarter. • Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Quarterly Financial Segment Summary • Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $940 million, down 13 percent year-over-year and up 13 percent quarter-over-quarter. Revenue was lower year-over-year primarily due to lower graphics channel sales, partially offset by increased client processor and datacenter GPU sales. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher GPU sales. • Client processor average selling price (ASP) was up year-over-year driven by Ryzen processor sales. Client processor ASP was down quarter-over-quarter due to a higher mix of mobile processor sales. • GPU ASP increased year-over-year primarily driven by datacenter GPU sales. GPU ASP was down slightly quarter-over-quarter due to lower datacenter GPU sales and higher graphics channel sales. • Operating income was $22 million, compared to $117 million a year ago and $16 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase was due to higher GPU sales. • Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $591 million, down 12 percent year-over-year and up 34 percent sequentially. The year-over-year revenue decrease was primarily due to lower semi-custom product revenue, partially offset by higher EPYC processor sales. The quarter-over-quarter increase was driven by higher semi-custom and EPYC processor revenue. 2 • Operating income was $89 million, compared to $69 million a year ago and $68 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily driven by higher EPYC processor sales. • All Other operating loss was $52 million compared to $33 million a year ago and $46 million in the prior quarter.

The sequential and year-over-year increases are expected to be driven by Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon product sales. AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 43 percent in the third quarter of 2019. For full year 2019, AMD now expects revenue to increase a mid-single digit percent over 2018 driven by significant sales growth of our new Ryzen, EPYC and Radeon processors, partially offset by lower than expected semi-custom revenue. Revenue excluding semi-custom is expected to grow approximately 20 percent year over year. AMD expects non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 42 percent for 2019.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP operating income for stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, the Company also included a loss contingency on legal matter in the three and six months ended June 29, 2019 and the three months ended March 30, 2019. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest income and expense and income taxes that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. All periods presented conform to the current period presentation. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these Non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 12 "
