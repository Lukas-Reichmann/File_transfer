Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2023 (the “2022 Form 10-K”).

Segment Information The following tables summarize revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment. Intersegment sales prices are market based. The “Other” column as it relates to Segment Income below primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Fiscal Quarters Ended September 10, 2023 and September 11, 2022 U.S. Supply International Intersegment Stores Chain Franchise Revenues Other Total Revenues 2023 $ 336,133 $ 643,728 $ 73,142 $ ( 25,642 ) $ — $ 1,027,361 2022 355,459 683,267 67,055 ( 37,185 ) — 1,068,596 Segment Income 2023 $ 120,351 $ 55,250 $ 61,495 N/A $ ( 19,809 ) $ 217,287 2022 100,529 49,892 53,762 N/A ( 2,919 ) 201,264 Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 10, 2023 and September 11, 2022 U.S. Supply International Intersegment Stores Chain Franchise Revenues Other Total Revenues 2023 $ 1,005,055 $ 1,935,332 $ 213,308 $ ( 77,309 ) $ — $ 3,076,386 2022 1,039,909 2,008,526 202,803 ( 106,311 ) — 3,144,927 Segment Income 2023 $ 356,626 $ 163,791 $ 178,499 N/A $ ( 54,396 ) $ 644,520 2022 301,876 149,874 161,698 N/A ( 16,250 ) 597,198 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across the Company’s franchise system. This allocation methodology change was implemented in order to reflect the way the chief operating decision maker allocates resources to the Company’s reportable segments and evaluates segment profitability, including the costs of internally developed software. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $ 15.9 million , an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $ 2.0 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $ 17.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $ 41.8 million , an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $ 5.9 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $ 47.7 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs had no impact on revenues, supply chain Segment Income or total Segment Income. The change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs is a prospective change and the comparative information has not been restated. 7 The following table reconciles total Segment Income to consolidated income before provision for income taxes.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Fair Value of Investments The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. Prior to March 28, 2023, the Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which were not in-substance common stock, represented an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and was recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. On March 28, 2023, DPC Dash completed its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Exchange (HK: 1405), at which point the Company’s 18,101,019 DPC Dash senior ordinary shares automatically converted to DPC Dash ordinary shares pursuant to the terms of the investment.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the Company accounts for its investment in DPC Dash as a trading security and records it at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recorded in other income or expense in its condensed consolidated statements of income. As of September 10, 2023 , the fair value of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash is based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security of HK$ 60.25 per share.

The Company transferred its investment from Level 3 to Level 1 on March 28, 2023, concurrent with DPC Dash’s initial public offering. 10 The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at September 10, 2023 and January 1, 2023: At September 10, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 57,239 $ 57,239 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 133,359 133,359 — — Investments in marketable securities 15,753 15,753 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 114,704 114,704 — — Investment in DPC Dash 139,107 139,107 — — At January 1, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 23,779 $ 23,779 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,212 117,212 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,395 13,395 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 124,496 124,496 — — Investment in DPC Dash 125,840 — — 125,840 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the Company ’s 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 notes as follows: September 10, 2023 January 1, 2023 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 746,000 $ 715,414 $ 752,000 $ 717,408 2017 Ten-Year Notes 945,000 875,070 952,500 875,348 2018 7.5-Year Notes 404,813 385,382 408,000 385,968 2018 9.25-Year Notes 381,000 355,473 384,000 355,584 2019 Ten-Year Notes 651,375 567,999 656,438 564,536 2021 7.5-Year Notes 830,875 705,413 837,250 695,755 2021 Ten-Year Notes 977,500 798,618 985,000 792,925 The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at September 10, 2023 or January 1, 2023 . 11 6.

On May 15, 2023, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries executed an amendment to the Company’s 2021 variable funding notes to affect the transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. In connection with this contract amendment, the Company adopted ASU 2020-04 (as updated by ASU 2022-06) in the second quarter of 2023. The amendment to the Company’s 2021 variable funding notes and the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”) , which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2023 and 2022 third quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended September 10, 2023 and September 11, 2022, respectively. The 2023 and 2022 three fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the thirty-six-week periods ended September 10, 2023 and September 11, 2022, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 20,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of September 10, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise and Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino’s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of September 10, 2023. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of U.S. Company-owned stores. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders. 16 Third Quarter of 2023 Highlights Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Highlights Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Domino’s experienced global retail sales growth during the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. same store sales declined 0.6% and increased 1.0% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively, compared to an increase of 2.0% and a decline of 1.6% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. The decline in U.S. same store sales in the third quarter of 2023 was due to lower order volumes, partially offset by a higher average ticket per transaction. The increase in U.S. same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 was attributable to a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing, partially offset by lower order volumes. In the three fiscal quarters of 2023 in the U.S., we also launched our newest menu items, Domino’s Loaded Tots and Pepperoni Stuffed Cheesy Bread. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 3.3% and 2.6% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively, rolling over a decline in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 1.8% and 0.8% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete. We had third quarter 2023 global net store decline of 8 stores, comprised of 27 net store openings in the U.S. and 35 net store closures internationally. Net store decline in the third quarter of 2023 reflects the closure of the remaining 143 stores in the Russia market. For the three fiscal quarters of 2023, we continued our global expansion with the opening of 317 net stores. Overall, we believe our global net store growth during the three fiscal quarters of 2023, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology, operations and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. On August 21, 2023, our master franchisee that owned and operated Domino’s Pizza ® stores in Russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. Therefore, as of August 21, 2023, we have considered the stores in the Russia market to be closed and they are excluded from our ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, we have presented our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 10, 2023 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the Russia market. We believe the impact of the Russia market on our statistical measure of global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 11, 2022 was immaterial and prior amounts have not been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. We believe the impact of the Russia market on our statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and we also believe the impact of the Russia market on our condensed consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the periods presented was immaterial. We have not received any royalties and fees from the operations of the Russia market subsequent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 17 Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. The 2023 global retail sales growth measures excluding the Russia market are calculated as the growth in retail sales excluding the retail sales from the Russia market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales base. Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. stores + 0.9% + 4.1% + 2.5% + 0.7% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) (1) + 9.4% + 5.2% + 8.9% + 5.7% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) (2) + 5.1% + 4.7% + 5.7% + 3.2% (1) (2) 2023 figures exclude the impact of the Russia market. Including the impact of the Russia market, international stores retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was 9.0% and 8.5% for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively. 2023 figures exclude the impact of the Russia market. Including the impact of the Russia market, total global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was 4.9% and 5.5% for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively. Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification. Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores + 2.9% (1.9)% + 5.2% (7.3)% U.S. franchise stores (0.7)% + 2.2% + 0.8% (1.2)% U.S. stores (0.6)% + 2.0% + 1.0% (1.6)% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 3.3% (1.8)% + 2.6% (0.8)% Store Growth Activity Net store growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Net store growth is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth. Net store decline in the third quarter of 2023 reflects the closure of the remaining 143 net stores in the Russia market. Net store growth in the trailing four quarters reflects the closure of the remaining 189 net stores in the Russia market.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 86.3 25.7 % $ 112.4 31.6 % $ 258.9 25.8 % $ 328.8 31.6 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 138.3 41.1 % 128.9 36.3 % 410.5 40.8 % 379.3 36.5 % U.S. franchise advertising 111.5 33.2 % 114.2 32.1 % 335.7 33.4 % 331.9 31.9 % Total U.S. stores revenues $ 336.1 100.0 % $ 355.5 100.0 % $ 1,005.1 100.0 % $ 1,039.9 100.0 % U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $26.1 million, or 23.2%, in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased $69.9 million, or 21.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the refranchising of 114 U.S. Company-owned stores in Arizona and Utah in the fourth quarter of 2022 to certain of our U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Sale”). This decrease was partially offset by higher same store sales, and, to a lesser extent in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, our purchase of 23 U.S. franchise stores in Michigan in the first quarter of 2022. 19 U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 2.9% in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 5.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 1.9% in the third quarter of 2022 and declined 7.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $9.4 million, or 7.3%, in the third quarter of 2023, and increased $31.2 million, or 8.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, as well as an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 Store Sale, and, to a lesser extent, net store growth. Lower same store sales in the third quarter of 2023 partially offset these increases in revenue, while higher same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 also contributed to the increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees. U.S. franchise same store sales declined 0.7% in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 0.8% in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 2.2% in the third quarter of 2022 and declined 1.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising decreased $2.7 million, or 2.3%, in the third quarter of 2023 due to a temporary reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution which was effectuated at the beginning of the second quarter of 2023, as well as a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales in the third quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 Store Sale, and, to a lesser extent, net store growth. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $3.9 million, or 1.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from the 2022 Store Sale, and, to a lesser extent, net store growth. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising also benefited from higher same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. These increases were partially offset by the 0.25% reduction in the standard advertising contribution referenced above. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues decreased $28.0 million, or 4.3%, in the third quarter of 2023 due to lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores as well as a decrease in our market basket pricing to stores of 1.7% in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in an estimated $12.8 million decrease in supply chain revenues. Supply chain revenues decreased $44.2 million, or 2.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 0.2% during the three fiscal quarters of 2023 which did not have a significant impact on supply chain revenues. The market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $6.1 million, or 9.1%, in the third quarter of 2023, and increased $10.5 million, or 5.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth during the trailing four quarters. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $6.4 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 partially offset the increases in international franchise royalties and fees. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to U.S. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 3.3% in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 2.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales declined 1.8% in the third quarter of 2022 and declined 0.8% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. 20 Cost of Sales / Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Total revenues $ 1,027.4 100.0 % $ 1,068.6 100.0 % $ 3,076.4 100.0 % $ 3,144.9 100.0 % Total cost of sales 629.2 61.2 % 686.7 64.3 % 1,888.0 61.4 % 2,008.2 63.9 % Gross margin $ 398.2 38.8 % $ 381.9 35.7 % $ 1,188.4 38.6 % $ 1,136.7 36.1 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $16.3 million, or 4.3%, in the third quarter of 2023, and increased $51.7 million, or 4.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to higher global franchise royalty revenues, as well as improved procurement productivity within supply chain. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 3.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 2.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 3.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 2.3 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. Supply chain gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 0.7 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. These changes in gross margin are described in more detail below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Revenues $ 86.3 100.0 % $ 112.4 100.0 % $ 258.9 100.0 % $ 328.8 100.0 % Cost of sales 72.6 84.2 % 98.6 87.7 % 214.6 82.9 % 280.0 85.2 % Store gross margin $ 13.7 15.8 % $ 13.8 12.3 % $ 44.3 17.1 % $ 48.8 14.8 % U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $0.1 million, or 1.0%, in the third quarter of 2023 and decreased $4.5 million, or 9.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to the 2022 Store Sale. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 3.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2023 and increased 2.3 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Revenues $ 618.1 100.0 % $ 646.1 100.0 % $ 1,858.0 100.0 % $ 1,902.2 100.0 % Cost of sales 556.6 90.0 % 588.2 91.0 % 1,673.4 90.1 % 1,728.2 90.8 % Supply chain gross margin $ 61.5 10.0 % $ 57.9 9.0 % $ 184.6 9.9 % $ 174.0 9.2 % Supply chain gross margin increased $3.6 million, or 6.2%, in the third quarter of 2023, and increased $10.6 million, or 6.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the third quarter of 2023, and increased 0.7 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to procurement productivity. Lower food costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues also benefited the supply chain gross margin in the third quarter of 2023. These improvements in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues were partially offset in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023 by higher labor costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues. 21 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $6.0 million, or 6.6%, in the third quarter of 2023, driven primarily by higher labor costs. General and administrative expenses increased $4.4 million, or 1.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, driven primarily by higher labor costs, partially offset by lower travel costs. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 2.3%, consistent with the decrease in U.S. franchise advertising revenues in the third quarter of 2023. U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $3.9 million, or 1.2%, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023, we recorded a $28.2 million and $13.3 million, respectively, unrealized gain on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in the first quarter of 2023 or three fiscal quarters of 2022. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $2.5 million, or 5.6%, in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased $7.4 million, or 5.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, each driven by higher interest income on our cash equivalents. Our weighted average borrowing rate increased to 3.8% in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2023 from 3.7% in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $3.4 million, or 11.0%, in the third quarter of 2023 due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 15.9% during the third quarter of 2023 as compared to 23.8% in the third quarter of 2022, driven in part by higher foreign tax credits and by a 1.1 percentage point change in the impact of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision. Provision for income taxes decreased $4.0 million, or 4.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 19.0% during the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to 23.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, driven in part by higher foreign tax credits and by a 0.4 percentage point change in the impact of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision. 22 Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across our franchise system. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $15.9 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $2.0 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $17.9 million in the third quarter of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $41.8 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $5.9 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $47.7 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. Third Quarter of 2023 Third Quarter of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. stores $ 120.4 $ 100.5 $ 356.6 $ 301.9 Supply chain 55.3 49.9 163.8 149.9 International franchise 61.5 53.8 178.5 161.7 Other (19.8 ) (2.9 ) (54.4 ) (16.3 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $19.8 million, or 19.7%, in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the $0.1 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income increased $54.8 million, or 18.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the $4.5 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $5.4 million, or 10.7%, in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the $3.6 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above. Supply chain Segment Income increased $13.9 million, or 9.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the $10.6 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $7.7 million, or 14.4%, in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. International franchise Segment Income increased $16.8 million, or 10.4%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income decreased $16.9 million, or 578.6%, in the third quarter of 2023, and decreased $38.1 million, or 234.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs as discussed above, as well as higher labor costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower travel costs in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. 23 Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of September 10, 2023, we had working capital of $26.2 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $202.3 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $151.5 million and advertising fund liabilities of $147.3 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $80.9 million. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes (as defined below). During the three fiscal quarters of 2023, we experienced an increase in both U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, both our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts during the three fiscal quarters of 2023. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. These facilities include our Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2022 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes,” and, together with the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, the “2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs. As of September 10, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $277.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.2 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, any excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of September 10, 2023, we had $151.0 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $51.1 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $202.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 10, 2023, we also held $136.6 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of September 10, 2023, we had approximately $4.99 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.8 million was classified as a current liability. As of September 10, 2023, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $12.9 million in the remainder of 2023, $51.5 million in 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. 24 Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. During the third quarter of 2023, we repurchased and retired 229,860 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $90.0 million. During the three fiscal quarters of 2023, we repurchased and retired 622,405 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $210.8 million. As of September 10, 2023, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $199.5 million. Dividends On July 20, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2023, which was paid on September 29, 2023. We had approximately $43.4 million accrued for common stock dividends at September 10, 2023. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 10, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2023, to be paid on December 29, 2023. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 422.1 $ 330.2 Net cash used in investing activities (60.0 ) (58.7 ) Net cash used in financing activities (337.2 ) (304.3 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.3 ) (0.6 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 24.6 $ (33.4 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $92.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $54.9 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities and inventory as well as changes in inventory pricing and the timing of payments on accounts payable in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2022. Additionally, net income increased $67.9 million and non-cash adjustments decreased $28.9 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2022 of $39.0 million. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $1.9 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts for advertising contributions. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $60.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, which primarily consisted of $59.3 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $337.2 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, which included the repurchase of approximately $210.8 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, dividend payments of $85.6 million, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $41.3 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $5.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $5.8 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2022 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 1, 2023. 25 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes and, at September 10, 2023, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. As of September 10, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. Accordingly, a rising interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense due on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed-rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 7.1% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2023, approximately 6.9% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2023, approximately 6.3% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately 6.4% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $18.8 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended September 10, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 27 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2023 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter and two fiscal quarters ended June 18, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 . 2. Segment Information The following tables summarize revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment. Intersegment sales prices are market based. The “Other” column as it relates to Segment Income below primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Fiscal Quarters Ended June 18, 2023 and June 19, 2022 U.S. Supply International Intersegment Stores Chain Franchise Revenues Other Total Revenues 2023 $ 338,421 $ 641,481 $ 70,495 $ ( 25,770 ) $ — $ 1,024,627 2022 351,681 683,298 66,915 ( 36,712 ) — 1,065,182 Segment Income 2023 $ 123,592 $ 60,026 $ 58,865 N/A $ ( 18,865 ) $ 223,618 2022 104,055 53,633 52,890 N/A ( 5,621 ) 204,957 Two Fiscal Quarters Ended June 18, 2023 and June 19, 2022 U.S. Supply International Intersegment Stores Chain Franchise Revenues Other Total Revenues 2023 $ 668,922 $ 1,291,605 $ 140,166 $ ( 51,668 ) $ — $ 2,049,025 2022 684,450 1,325,260 135,748 ( 69,127 ) — 2,076,331 Segment Income 2023 $ 236,275 $ 108,541 $ 117,004 N/A $ ( 34,587 ) $ 427,233 2022 201,347 99,982 107,936 N/A ( 13,331 ) 395,934 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across the Company’s franchise system. This allocation methodology change was implemented in order to reflect the way the chief operating decision maker allocates resources to the Company’s reportable segments and evaluates segment profitability, including the costs of internally developed software. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $ 15.8 million , an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $ 1.9 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $ 17.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $ 25.9 million , an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $ 3.8 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $ 29.7 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs had no impact on revenues, supply chain Segment Income or total Segment Income. The change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs is a prospective change and the comparative information has not been restated. 7 The following table reconciles total Segment Income to consolidated income before provision for income taxes.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Fair Value of Investments The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. Prior to March 28, 2023, the Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which were not in-substance common stock, represented an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and was recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. On March 28, 2023, DPC Dash completed its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Exchange (HK: 1405), at which point the Company’s 18,101,019 DPC Dash senior ordinary shares automatically converted to DPC Dash ordinary shares pursuant to the terms of the investment. The Company is required to hold the DPC Dash ordinary shares for at least 360 days from the date of the initial public offering. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the Company accounts for its investment in DPC Dash as a trading security and records it at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recorded in other income or expense in its condensed consolidated statements of income. As of June 18, 2023 , the fair value of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash is based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security of HK$ 47.90 per share. The Company recorded an adjustment to the carrying amount of its investment in DPC Dash of $ 15.0 million in the second quarter of 2023, with the loss recorded in other expense in its condensed consolidated statements of income. As of January 1, 2023, the fair value of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash was not readily determinable and was categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of its investment in the first quarter of 2023 or the two fiscal quarters of 2022. The Company transferred its investment from Level 3 to Level 1 on March 28, 2023, concurrent with DPC Dash’s initial public offering. 10 The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at June 18, 2023 and January 1, 2023: At June 18, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 32,110 $ 32,110 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 119,501 119,501 — — Investments in marketable securities 14,742 14,742 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 118,505 118,505 — — Investment in DPC Dash 110,876 110,876 — — At January 1, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 23,779 $ 23,779 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,212 117,212 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,395 13,395 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 124,496 124,496 — — Investment in DPC Dash 125,840 — — 125,840 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the Company ’s 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 notes as follows: June 18, 2023 January 1, 2023 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 748,000 $ 715,088 $ 752,000 $ 717,408 2017 Ten-Year Notes 947,500 878,333 952,500 875,348 2018 7.5-Year Notes 405,875 384,770 408,000 385,968 2018 9.25-Year Notes 382,000 357,170 384,000 355,584 2019 Ten-Year Notes 653,063 572,736 656,438 564,536 2021 7.5-Year Notes 833,000 706,384 837,250 695,755 2021 Ten-Year Notes 980,000 803,600 985,000 792,925 The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at June 18, 2023 or January 1, 2023 . 11 6. Revenue Disclosures Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees.

Change in Advertising Fund Contributions and Technology Fees Beginning in the second quarter of 2023 , as of March 27, 2023, Domino's National Advertising Fund Inc., the Company’s consolidated not-for-profit advertising subsidiary, effectuated a temporary reduction of 0.25 % to its standard 6.0 % advertising contribution, which is anticipated to be in effect for at least one year from the effective date. Concurrently, the Company also increased the U.S. digital per-transaction technology fees that are recognized as the related U.S. franchise retail sales occur by $ 0.08 to $ 0.395 for the same time period. Subsequent Events Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2023, the Company entered into a new global agreement with Uber (NYSE:UBER) to allow customers to order Domino’s products through the Uber Eats and Postmates apps with delivery by the Company and its franchisees’ delivery experts. The Company expects the U.S. rollout of this agreement to be enabled by the end of fiscal 2023. 7. Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, vehicles, equipment and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2041.

New Accounting Pronouncements The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and adopted the following accounting standards during the second quarter of 2023. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, updated by ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (“ASU 2022-06”) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. On May 15, 2023, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries executed an amendment to the Company’s 2021 variable funding notes to affect the transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. In connection with this contract amendment, the Company adopted ASU 2020-04 (as updated by ASU 2022-06) in the second quarter of 2023. The amendment to the Company’s 2021 variable funding notes and the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”) , which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. ASU 2022-03 also requires disclosure of the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) is subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the Company from selling the security for 360 days following DPC Dash’s initial public offering. The Company early adopted ASU 2022-03 in the second quarter of 2023 and the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. 14 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2023 and 2022 second quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended June 18, 2023 and June 19, 2022, respectively. The 2023 and 2022 two fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the twenty-four-week periods ended June 18, 2023 and June 19, 2022, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 20,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of June 18, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise and Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino’s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of June 18, 2023. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of U.S. Company-owned stores. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders. 15 Second Quarter of 2023 Highlights Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Highlights Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino’s experienced global retail sales growth during the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023, driven by both same store sales growth and net store count growth. U.S. same store sales increased 0.1% and 1.8% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively, rolling over a decline in U.S. same store sales of 2.9% and 3.3% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. The increases in U.S. same store sales in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023 were attributable to a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing. In the two fiscal quarters of 2023 in the U.S., we also launched our newest menu item, Domino’s Loaded Tots. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 3.6% and 2.3% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively, rolling over a decline in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 2.2% and 0.5% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as changes in consumer behavior. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 197 net stores in the second quarter of 2023, bringing our year-to-date total to 325. We had 27 net stores open in the U.S. and 170 net stores open internationally during the second quarter of 2023. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology, operations and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. 16 Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. stores + 1.7% (0.6)% + 3.4% (1.0)% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 10.1% + 3.7% + 8.3% + 6.0% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) + 5.8% + 1.5% + 5.8% + 2.5% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification. Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores + 5.5% (9.2)% + 6.4% (9.8)% U.S. franchise stores (0.1)% (2.5)% + 1.6% (2.9)% U.S. stores + 0.1% (2.9)% + 1.8% (3.3)% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 3.6% (2.2)% + 2.3% (0.5)% Store Growth Activity Net store growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Net store growth is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 87.7 25.9 % $ 112.5 32.0 % $ 172.6 25.8 % $ 216.4 31.6 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 139.3 41.2 % 128.1 36.4 % 272.1 40.7 % 250.4 36.6 % U.S. franchise advertising 111.5 32.9 % 111.1 31.6 % 224.2 33.5 % 217.7 31.8 % Total U.S. Stores $ 338.4 100.0 % $ 351.7 100.0 % $ 668.9 100.0 % $ 684.5 100.0 % U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $24.8 million, or 22.1%, in the second quarter of 2023, and decreased $43.8 million, or 20.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the refranchising of 114 U.S. Company-owned stores in Arizona and Utah in the fourth quarter of 2022 to certain of our U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Sale”). This decrease was partially offset by higher same store sales, and, to a lesser extent in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, our purchase of 23 U.S. franchise stores in Michigan in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 6.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 9.2% in the second quarter of 2022 and declined 9.8% in the two fiscal quarters of 2022. 18 U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $11.2 million, or 8.7%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $21.7 million, or 8.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 primarily due to an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees were also benefited by higher same store sales in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. franchise same store sales declined 0.1% and increased 1.6% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023, respectively. U.S. franchise same store sales declined 2.5% and 2.9% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $0.4 million, or 0.3%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $6.5 million, or 3.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising also benefited from higher same store sales in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of 0.25% to the standard 6.0% advertising contribution which was effectuated at the beginning of the second quarter of 2023. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues decreased $30.9 million, or 4.8%, in the second quarter of 2023 due to lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores as well as a decrease in our market basket pricing to stores of 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023, which resulted in an estimated $13.4 million decrease in supply chain revenues. Supply chain revenues decreased $16.2 million, or 1.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores, but this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our market basket pricing to stores. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 1.1% during the two fiscal quarters of 2023 which resulted in an estimated $11.7 million increase in supply chain revenues. The market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $3.6 million, or 5.4%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $4.4 million, or 3.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $6.3 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 partially offset the increases in international franchise royalties and fees revenues. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to U.S. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 3.6% in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 2.3% in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales declined 2.2% and 0.5% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. 19 Cost of Sales / Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Total revenues $ 1,024.6 100.0 % $ 1,065.2 100.0 % $ 2,049.0 100.0 % $ 2,076.3 100.0 % Total cost of sales 620.0 60.5 % 678.9 63.7 % 1,258.8 61.4 % 1,321.4 63.6 % Gross margin $ 404.7 39.5 % $ 386.3 36.3 % $ 790.2 38.6 % $ 754.9 36.4 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $18.4 million, or 4.8%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $35.3 million, or 4.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 3.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 2.2 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 2.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 1.5 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. Supply chain gross margin increased 1.4 percentage points in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 0.7 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. These changes in gross margin are described in more detail below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Revenues $ 87.7 100.0 % $ 112.5 100.0 % $ 172.6 100.0 % $ 216.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 71.4 81.4 % 94.1 83.6 % 142.0 82.3 % 181.4 83.8 % Store gross margin $ 16.3 18.6 % $ 18.4 16.4 % $ 30.6 17.7 % $ 35.0 16.2 % U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $2.1 million, or 11.7%, in the second quarter of 2023 and decreased $4.4 million, or 12.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to the 2022 Store Sale. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 2.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2023 and increased 1.5 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Revenues $ 615.7 100.0 % $ 646.6 100.0 % $ 1,239.9 100.0 % $ 1,256.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 548.5 89.1 % 584.9 90.5 % 1,116.8 90.1 % 1,140.0 90.8 % Supply chain gross margin $ 67.2 10.9 % $ 61.7 9.5 % $ 123.1 9.9 % $ 116.1 9.2 % Supply chain gross margin increased $5.5 million, or 8.8%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $7.0 million, or 6.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 1.4 percentage points in the second quarter of 2023 due primarily to lower food costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues, as well as procurement productivity. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 0.7 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to procurement productivity but was partially offset by higher food cost as a percentage of supply chain revenues. The improvements in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues were partially offset in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023 by higher labor costs. 20 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 0.7%, in the second quarter of 2023, driven primarily by higher labor costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $1.6 million, or 0.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, driven primarily by lower professional fees and travel costs, partially offset by higher labor costs. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $0.4 million, or 0.3%, in the second quarter of 2023, and increased $6.5 million, or 3.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Expense During the second quarter of 2023, we recorded a $15.0 million unrealized loss on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) based on the active exchange quoted price for the equity security. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in the first quarter of 2023 or two fiscal quarters of 2022. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $2.2 million, or 5.0%, in the second quarter of 2023, and decreased $4.9 million, or 5.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 each driven by higher interest income on our cash equivalents. Our weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023 and 2022. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $2.3 million, or 7.5%, in the second quarter of 2023 due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 20.8% during the second quarter of 2023 as compared to 23.2% in the second quarter of 2022, driven in part by higher foreign tax credits and a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction. Provision for income taxes decreased $0.5 million, or 0.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due to a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.1% during the two fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to 23.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, driven in part by higher foreign tax credits and a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction. 21 Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across our franchise system. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $15.8 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $1.9 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $17.7 million in the second quarter of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $25.9 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $3.8 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $29.7 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. Second Quarter of 2023 Second Quarter of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 U.S. stores $ 123.6 $ 104.1 $ 236.3 $ 201.3 Supply chain 60.0 53.6 108.5 100.0 International franchise 58.9 52.9 117.0 107.9 Other (18.9 ) (5.6 ) (34.6 ) (13.3 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $19.5 million, or 18.8%, in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the $2.1 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income increased $34.9 million, or 17.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the $4.4 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $6.4 million, or 11.9%, in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to the $5.5 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above. Supply chain Segment Income increased $8.6 million, or 8.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the $7.0 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $6.0 million, or 11.3%, in the second quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. International franchise Segment Income increased $9.1 million, or 8.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues as well as the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, each as discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income decreased $13.2 million, or 235.6%, in the second quarter of 2023, and decreased $21.3 million, or 159.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 due primarily to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs as discussed above, as well as higher labor costs. These decreases were partially offset by lower professional fees and travel costs in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. 22 Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of June 18, 2023, we had working capital of $58.7 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $189.7 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $154.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of $150.4 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $77.0 million. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes (as defined below). During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023, we experienced an increase in both U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, both our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts during the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2023. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. These facilities include our Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2022 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes,” and, together with the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, the “2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs. As of June 18, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $277.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.2 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, any excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of June 18, 2023, we had $138.5 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $51.0 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $189.7 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of June 18, 2023, we also held $139.1 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of June 18, 2023, we had approximately $5.0 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.7 million was classified as a current liability. As of June 18, 2023, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $25.8 million in the remainder of 2023, $51.5 million in 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. 23 Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2023, we repurchased and retired 292,030 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $90.8 million. During the two fiscal quarters of 2023, we repurchased and retired 392,545 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $120.8 million As of June 18, 2023, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $289.5 million. Dividends On April 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2023, which was paid on June 30, 2023. We had approximately $43.6 million accrued for common stock dividends at June 18, 2023. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, on July 20, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2023, to be paid on September 29, 2023. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: Two Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 242.3 $ 153.4 Net cash used in investing activities (39.2 ) (39.9 ) Net cash used in financing activities (193.0 ) (166.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 0.5 (0.6 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 10.6 $ (53.9 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $88.9 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $69.2 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities and inventory as well as changes in inventory pricing and the timing of receipts on accounts receivable in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2022. Additionally, net income increased $20.7 million and non-cash adjustments increased $4.7 million, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2022 of $25.4 million. These increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a $5.7 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the two fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts for advertising contributions. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $39.2 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, which primarily consisted of $38.0 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $193.0 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, which included the repurchase of approximately $120.8 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, dividend payments of $42.9 million, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $27.2 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $3.1 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.1 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2022 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 1, 2023. 24 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes and, at June 18, 2023, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. As of June 18, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. Accordingly, a rising interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense due on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed-rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.9% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2023, approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2023, approximately 6.3% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2022 and approximately 6.5% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $12.4 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2023. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended June 18, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 26 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023 included in the Company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2023 (the “2022 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended March 26, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023 . 2. Segment Information The following tables summarize revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment. Intersegment sales prices are market based. The “Other” column as it relates to Segment Income below primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Fiscal Quarters Ended March 26, 2023 and March 27, 2022 U.S. Supply International Intersegment Stores Chain Franchise Revenues Other Total Revenues 2023 $ 330,501 $ 650,124 $ 69,671 $ ( 25,898 ) $ — $ 1,024,398 2022 332,769 641,962 68,833 ( 32,415 ) — 1,011,149 Segment Income 2023 $ 112,683 $ 48,515 $ 58,139 N/A $ ( 15,722 ) $ 203,615 2022 97,292 46,349 55,046 N/A ( 7,710 ) 190,977 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company changed its allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across the Company’s franchise system. This allocation methodology change was implemented in order to reflect the way the chief operating decision maker allocates resources to the Company’s reportable segments and evaluates segment profitability, including the costs of internally developed software. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $ 10.1 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $ 2.0 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $ 12.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs had no impact on revenues, supply chain Segment Income or total Segment Income. The change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs is a prospective change and the comparative information has not been restated. The following table reconciles total Segment Income to consolidated income before provision for income taxes. Fiscal Quarter Ended March 26, March 27, 2023 2022 Total Segment Income $ 203,615 $ 190,977 Depreciation and amortization ( 18,170 ) ( 18,976 ) Refranchising loss ( 149 ) — Loss on sale/disposal of assets ( 275 ) ( 195 ) Non-cash equity-based compensation expense ( 7,538 ) ( 7,265 ) Income from operations 177,483 164,541 Interest income 2,391 49 Interest expense ( 46,547 ) ( 46,872 ) Income before provision for income taxes $ 133,327 $ 117,718 7 3.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at March 26, 2023 and January 1, 2023: At March 26, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 112,975 $ 112,975 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 122,896 122,896 — — Investments in marketable securities 14,622 14,622 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 100,768 100,768 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 At January 1, 2023 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 23,779 $ 23,779 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,212 117,212 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,395 13,395 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 124,496 124,496 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 9 The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd (“DPC Dash”), the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of its investment in DPC Dash of $ 125.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 or 2022. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2023, on March 28, 2023, DPC Dash completed its initial public offering on the Hong Kong Exchange (HK: 1405) at a price of HK$ 46.00 per share, at which point the Company’s 18,101,019 senior ordinary shares automatically converted to ordinary shares pursuant to the terms of the investment. The Company is required to hold the ordinary shares for at least 360 days from the date of the initial public offering. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the Company will account for its investment as a trading security and will record it at fair value at the end of each reporting period, with gains and losses recorded in other income or expense in its condensed consolidated statements of income. Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the Company's 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 notes as follows: March 26, 2023 January 1, 2023 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 750,000 $ 730,500 $ 752,000 $ 717,408 2017 Ten-Year Notes 950,000 900,600 952,500 875,348 2018 7.5-Year Notes 406,938 393,102 408,000 385,968 2018 9.25-Year Notes 383,000 366,531 384,000 355,584 2019 Ten-Year Notes 654,750 588,620 656,438 564,536 2021 7.5-Year Notes 835,125 725,724 837,250 695,755 2021 Ten-Year Notes 982,500 828,248 985,000 792,925 The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at March 26, 2023 or January 1, 2023 . 6.

Company-owned Store Transactions During the first quarter of 2023, the Company refranchised one U.S. Company-owned store for proceeds of less than $ 0.1 million. The pre-tax refranchising loss associated with the sale of the related assets and liabilities, including goodwill, was approximately $ 0.1 million. The refranchising loss associated with the sale of this store was recorded in refranchising loss in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. 12 10 . New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standards. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, updated by ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (“ASU 2022-06”) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s 2021 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents provide that after the date on which the administrator for LIBOR permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all available settings of U.S. dollar LIBOR, any new advances under the 2021 variable funding notes that would otherwise have borne interest based on LIBOR, as well as any existing LIBOR advances for which the interest period has expired, will instead bear interest at a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment. The loan documents also permit the lenders to affect a transition from LIBOR to Term SOFR at an earlier date, subject to certain conditions. The Company’s 2022 variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on Term SOFR. ASU 2020-04, as updated by ASU 2022-06, may currently be adopted and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (“ASU 2022-03”) , which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. ASU 2022-03 also requires disclosure of the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions, the nature and remaining duration of the restrictions and the circumstances that could cause a lapse in the restrictions. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) is subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the security for 360 days following its initial public offering. ASU 2022-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including applicable interim periods and early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt this accounting standard in the second quarter of 2023 and does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 13 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2023 and 2022 first quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended March 26, 2023 and March 27, 2022, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world, with more than 20,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of March 26, 2023, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, we are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on value while serving neighborhoods locally through our large network of franchise owners and Company-owned stores through both the delivery and carryout service models. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 99% of Domino’s global stores owned and operated by our independent franchisees as of March 26, 2023. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchised and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flow to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically provided strong returns for our shareholders. First Quarter of 2023 Highlights 14 Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino ’ s experienced global retail sales growth during the first quarter of 2023. U.S. same store sales increased 3.6% in the first quarter of 2023, rolling over a decline in U.S. same store sales of 3.6% in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in U.S. same store sales was primarily attributable to a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from increases in menu and national offer pricing. In the U.S., we also launched our newest menu item, Domino ’ s Loaded Tots, in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2023, we experienced higher supply chain revenues attributable to increases in market basket pricing to stores. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) increased 1.2% during the first quarter of 2023, rolling over an increase in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 1.2% in the first quarter of 2022. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 128 net stores in the first quarter of 2023. We had 22 net stores open in the U.S. and 106 net stores open internationally during the first quarter of 2023. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology, operations and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchised stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 U.S. stores + 5.1% (1.4)% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 6.5% + 8.4% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) + 5.9% + 3.6% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis, which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification. First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores + 7.3% (10.5)% U.S. franchise stores + 3.4% (3.2)% U.S. stores + 3.6% (3.6)% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) + 1.2% + 1.2% 15 Store Growth Activity Net store growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Net store growth is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth. U.S. Company- owned Stores U.S. Franchise Stores Total U.S. Stores International Stores Total Store count at January 1, 2023 286 6,400 6,686 13,194 19,880 Openings 1 24 25 143 168 Closings (1 ) (2 ) (3 ) (37 ) (40 ) Transfers (1 ) 1 — — — Store count at March 26, 2023 285 6,423 6,708 13,300 20,008 First quarter 2023 net store growth — 22 22 106 128 Trailing four quarters net store growth — 111 111 836 947 Income Statement Data First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 Revenues: U.S. Company-owned stores $ 84.9 $ 103.9 U.S. franchise royalties and fees 132.9 122.3 Supply chain 624.2 609.5 International franchise royalties and fees 69.7 68.8 U.S. franchise advertising 112.7 106.6 Total revenues 1,024.4 100.0 % 1,011.1 100.0 % Cost of sales: U.S. Company-owned stores 70.6 87.4 Supply chain 568.3 555.2 Total cost of sales 638.9 62.4 % 642.5 63.5 % Gross margin 385.5 37.6 % 368.6 36.5 % General and administrative 95.2 9.3 % 97.5 9.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 112.7 11.0 % 106.6 10.5 % Refranchising loss 0.1 0.0 % — 0.0 % Income from operations 177.5 17.3 % 164.5 16.3 % Interest expense, net (44.2 ) (4.3 )% (46.8 ) (4.7 )% Income before provision for income taxes 133.3 13.0 % 117.7 11.6 % Provision for income taxes 28.6 2.8 % 26.8 2.6 % Net income $ 104.8 10.2 % $ 91.0 9.0 % Revenues First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 84.9 8.3 % $ 103.9 10.3 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 132.9 13.0 % 122.3 12.1 % Supply chain 624.2 60.9 % 609.5 60.3 % International franchise royalties and fees 69.7 6.8 % 68.8 6.8 % U.S. franchise advertising 112.7 11.0 % 106.6 10.5 % Total revenues $ 1,024.4 100.0 % $ 1,011.1 100.0 % Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties and fees and advertising contributions from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 16 U.S. Stores Revenues First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 84.9 25.7 % $ 103.9 31.2 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 132.9 40.2 % 122.3 36.8 % U.S. franchise advertising 112.7 34.1 % 106.6 32.0 % Total U.S. Stores $ 330.5 100.0 % $ 332.8 100.0 % U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $19.0 million, or 18.3%, in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decrease in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from the refranchising of 114 U.S. Company-owned stores in Arizona and Utah in the fourth quarter of 2022 to certain of our U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Sale”). This decrease was partially offset by higher same store sales, and to a lesser extent, our purchase of 23 U.S. franchise stores in Michigan in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 7.3% in the first quarter of 2023 and decreased 10.5% in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $10.6 million, or 8.7%, in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale, higher same store sales and an increase in fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.4% in the first quarter of 2023 and decreased 3.2% in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, in the first quarter of 2023 due to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Sale, as well as higher same store sales. These increases were partially offset by approximately $0.9 million more in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $14.7 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2023 due to higher market basket pricing to stores; however, this increase was partially offset by lower order volumes at our U.S. franchised stores in the first quarter of 2023. The market basket pricing change, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from our U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance because as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 4.6% during the first quarter of 2023, which resulted in an estimated $25.1 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $0.8 million, or 1.2%, in the first quarter of 2023 due primarily to same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 partially offset the increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues, a statistical measure utilized by management, is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current year local currency results to U.S. dollars at current year exchange rates as compared to prior year exchange rates. We believe this measure is important to understanding Company performance given the significant variability in international franchise royalty revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.2% in the first quarter of 2023 and increased 1.2% in the first quarter of 2022. 17 Cost of Sales / Gross Margin First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 Total revenues $ 1,024.4 100.0 % $ 1,011.1 100.0 % Total cost of sales 638.9 62.4 % 642.5 63.5 % Gross margin $ 385.5 37.6 % $ 368.6 36.5 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $16.9 million, or 4.6%, in the first quarter of 2023, due primarily to higher global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin increased 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the first quarter of 2023. Supply chain gross margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023. These changes in gross margin are described in more detail below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Gross Margin First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 Revenues $ 84.9 100.0 % $ 103.9 100.0 % Cost of sales 70.6 83.1 % 87.4 84.1 % Store gross margin $ 14.3 16.9 % $ 16.5 15.9 % U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $2.2 million, or 13.2%, in the first quarter of 2023, due primarily to the 2022 Store Sale. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin increased 1.0 percentage point in the first quarter of 2023. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Gross Margin First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 Revenues $ 624.2 100.0 % $ 609.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 568.3 91.0 % 555.2 91.1 % Supply chain gross margin $ 55.9 9.0 % $ 54.4 8.9 % Supply chain gross margin increased $1.5 million, or 2.8%, in the first quarter of 2023. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain gross margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2023, due primarily to procurement productivity. This increase was partially offset by higher food costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $2.3 million, or 2.4%, in the first quarter of 2023, driven primarily by lower professional fees and travel costs. These decreases were partially offset by higher labor costs. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $6.1 million, or 5.8%, in the first quarter of 2023, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand, and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. 18 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $2.7 million, or 5.7%, in the first quarter of 2023 driven by higher interest income on our cash equivalents. Our weighted average borrowing rate increased to 3.8% in the first quarter of 2023 from 3.7% in the first quarter of 2022. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $1.8 million, or 6.7%, in the first quarter of 2023 due to higher income before provision for income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. The effective tax rate decreased to 21.4% during the first quarter of 2023 as compared to 22.7% in the first quarter of 2022, driven in part by a higher foreign derived intangible income deduction and higher foreign tax credits. Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. In the first quarter of 2023, we changed our allocation methodology for certain costs which support certain internally developed software used across our franchise system. The change in allocation methodology of certain software development costs resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. stores Segment Income of $10.1 million, an estimated increase in international franchise Segment Income of $2.0 million and an estimated decrease in other Segment Income of $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 U.S. stores $ 112.7 $ 97.3 Supply chain 48.5 46.3 International franchise 58.1 55.0 Other (15.7 ) (7.7 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $15.4 million, or 15.8%, in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. These increases were partially offset by the $2.2 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $2.2 million, or 4.7%, in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the $1.5 million increase in supply chain gross margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $3.1 million, or 5.6%, in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs as well as higher international franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income decreased $8.0 million, or 103.9%, in the first quarter of 2023, due primarily to the change in allocation methodology for certain software development costs, as well as higher labor cost. These increases were partially offset by lower professional fees and travel costs. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of March 26, 2023, we had working capital of $97.2 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $170.8 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $139.9 million and advertising fund liabilities of $136.6 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $154.2 million. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes (as defined below). During the first quarter of 2023, we experienced an increase in both U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, both our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts during the first quarter of 2023. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. In addition to our cash flows from operations, we have two variable funding note facilities. The facilities include our Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2022 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million, as well as our 2021 variable funding note facility (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes,” and, together with the 2022 Variable Funding Notes, the “2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes”), which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The letters of credit primarily relate to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of March 26, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings and $277.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business and other strategic opportunities, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2022 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of March 26, 2023, we had $119.8 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $50.8 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $170.8 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of March 26, 2023, we also held $119.8 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of March 26, 2023, we had approximately $5.01 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.2 million was classified as a current liability. As of March 26, 2023, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $38.6 million in the remainder of 2023, $51.5 million in 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. 20 Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. During the first quarter of 2023, we repurchased and retired 100,515 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $30.1 million. As of March 26, 2023, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $380.3 million. Dividends On February 21, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of March 15, 2023, which was paid on March 30, 2023. We had approximately $43.8 million accrued for common stock dividends at March 26, 2023. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, on April 25, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2023, to be paid on June 30, 2023. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) First Quarter of 2023 First Quarter of 2022 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 114.7 $ 78.8 Net cash used in investing activities (19.6 ) (20.6 ) Net cash used in financing activities (45.3 ) (62.1 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.2 ) 0.4 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 49.6 $ (3.6 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $42.5 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities as well as the timing and pricing of inventory in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $14.4 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts for advertising contributions. Additionally, net income increased $13.8 million; however, this included a $6.0 million decrease in non-cash adjustments, resulting in an overall increase to cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to the first quarter of 2022 of $7.8 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $19.6 million in the first quarter of 2023, which primarily consisted of $19.0 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $45.3 million in the first quarter of 2023, which primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately $30.1 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $13.9 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $1.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2022 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 1, 2023. 21 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions, nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes and, at March 26, 2023, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2022 and 2021 Variable Funding Notes. As of March 26, 2023, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 and 2022 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents provide that after the date on which the administrator for LIBOR permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all available settings of U.S. dollar LIBOR, any new advances under the 2021 Variable Funding Notes that would otherwise have borne interest based on LIBOR, as well as any existing LIBOR advances for which the interest period has expired, will instead bear interest at a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”), plus a spread adjustment, that in each case have been selected or recommended by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The loan documents also permit the lenders to affect a transition from LIBOR to Term SOFR at an earlier date, subject to certain conditions. Because the composition and characteristics of Term SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, there can be no assurance that Term SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Additionally, a rising interest rate environment could result in higher interest expense due on borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, as well as on our 2022 Variable Funding Notes, which bear interest at fluctuating interest rates that are based on Term SOFR. Our fixed-rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2022 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended March 26, 2023, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 23 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

Segment Information The following tables summarize revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment. Intersegment sales prices are market based. The “Other” column as it relates to Segment Income below primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs.

The 2022 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the Closing Date. The Company's existing $ 200.0 million Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”) also remain in place. 6. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at September 11, 2022 and January 2, 2022: At September 11, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 73,258 $ 73,258 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,195 117,195 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,498 13,498 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 146,235 146,235 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 At January 2, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 87,384 $ 87,384 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 115,185 115,185 — — Investments in marketable securities 15,433 15,433 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 140,115 140,115 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd, a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“DPC Dash”). Through its subsidiaries, DPC Dash serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. 10 The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 125.8 million in the third quarter or three fiscal quarters of 2022 . The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at September 12, 2021 as a result of the additional investment made in the first quarter of 2021: Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 12, 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, Unrealized September 12, 2021 Purchases Gain 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. M anagement estimated the approximate fair values of the Company's 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 fixed rate notes as follows: September 11, 2022 January 2, 2022 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 754,000 $ 734,396 $ 760,000 $ 777,480 2017 Ten-Year Notes 955,000 899,610 962,500 1,000,038 2018 7.5-Year Notes 409,063 394,336 412,250 420,907 2018 9.25-Year Notes 385,000 365,750 388,000 407,788 2019 Ten-Year Notes 658,125 590,996 663,188 693,031 2021 7.5-Year Notes 839,375 722,702 845,750 849,133 2021 Ten-Year Notes 987,500 834,438 995,000 1,017,885 The Company’s 2021 Variable Funding Notes are a variable rate loan and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2022 , the Company sold 114 U.S. Company-owned stores in Arizona and Utah to certain of its franchisees for $ 41.1 million, and the Company expects to record a gain on this transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. The accounting for this transaction is still in process as of the date these condensed consolidated financial statements were issued and therefore the Company is unable to make any additional disclosures. 13 11. New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has not yet adopted the following standard. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. The Company’s 2022 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on SOFR. ASU 2020-04 may currently be adopted and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 14 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2022 and 2021 third quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended September 11, 2022 and September 12, 2021, respectively. The 2022 and 2021 three fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the thirty-six-week periods ended September 11, 2022 and September 12, 2021, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 19,500 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of September 11, 2022, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s global stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the United States. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. Third Quarter of 2022 Highlights Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Highlights 15 Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino ’ s experienced global retail sales growth during the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. U.S. same store sales increased 2.0% in the third quarter of 2022 and declined 1.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, rolling over a decrease in U.S. same store sales of 1.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and an increase in U.S. same store sales of 4.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. The decline in U.S. same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 was attributable to lower order counts due in part to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets and economic stimulus activity in the U.S in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which did not recur in the respective periods of 2022. A higher average ticket per transaction resulting from higher menu and national offer pricing, as well as increases to our average delivery fee contributed to the increase in U.S. same store sales in the third quarter of 2022 and partially offset the decline in U.S. same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) declined 1.8% and 0.8% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively, rolling over increases in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 8.8% and 11.4% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. The decline in same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 in our international business was driven in part by a value added tax holiday in the United Kingdom in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 that did not recur in the second and third quarter of 2022. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, we experienced significant inflationary pressures in our commodity, labor and fuel costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., which had a significant impact on our overall operating results as compared to the respective periods of 2021. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 225 net stores in the third quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total to 671. We had 24 net stores open in the U.S. and 201 net stores open internationally during the third quarter of 2022. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. 16 Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. stores +4.1% +1.1% +0.7% +7.6% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +5.2% +16.5% +5.7% +19.2% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +4.7% +8.5% +3.2% +13.1% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores (1) (1.9)% (8.9)% (7.3)% (2.0)% U.S. franchise stores (1) +2.2% (1.5)% (1.2)% +5.1% U.S. stores +2.0% (1.9)% (1.6)% +4.6% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) (1.8)% +8.8% (0.8)% +11.4% (1) During the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Purchase”). The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. Company-owned stores in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022. Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance. U.S. Company- owned Stores U.S. Franchise Stores Total U.S. Stores International Stores Total Store count at June 19, 2022 401 6,218 6,619 12,675 19,294 Openings 1 26 27 263 290 Closings (1) — (3 ) (3 ) (62 ) (65 ) Store count at September 11, 2022 402 6,241 6,643 12,876 19,519 Third quarter 2022 net store growth 1 23 24 201 225 Trailing four quarters net store growth (2) 12 160 172 967 1,139 (1) Temporary store closures are not treated as store closures and affected stores are included in the ending store count. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of September 11, 2022, there were fewer than 125 international stores temporarily closed. (2) Trailing four quarters net store growth does not include the effect of transfers associated with the 2022 Store Purchase. 17 Income Statement Data Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores $112.4 $108.4 $328.8 $337.7 U.S. franchise royalties and fees 128.9 121.6 379.3 372.9 Supply chain 646.1 588.8 1,902.2 1,760.1 International franchise royalties and fees 67.1 70.6 202.8 207.1 U.S. franchise advertising 114.2 108.6 331.9 336.3 Total revenues 1,068.6 100.0% 998.0 100.0% 3,144.9 100.0% 3,014.2 100.0% U.S. Company-owned stores 98.6 86.9 280.0 260.7 Supply chain 588.2 525.9 1,728.2 1,571.4 Total cost of sales 686.7 64.3% 612.8 61.4% 2,008.2 63.9% 1,832.1 60.8% Gross margin 381.9 35.7% 385.2 38.6% 1,136.7 36.1% 1,182.0 39.2% General and administrative 91.2 8.5% 96.3 9.6% 285.8 9.1% 288.0 9.6% U.S. franchise advertising 114.2 10.7% 108.6 10.9% 331.9 10.5% 336.3 11.1% Income from operations 176.5 16.5% 180.3 18.1% 519.1 16.5% 557.7 18.5% Other income — 0.0% — 0.0% — 0.0% 2.5 0.1% Interest expense, net (44.6) (4.2)% (45.5) (4.6)% (136.1) (4.3)% (130.7) (4.3)% Income before provision for income taxes 131.8 12.3% 134.8 13.5% 383.0 12.2% 429.5 14.3% Provision for income taxes 31.3 2.9% 14.4 1.4% 89.1 2.9% 74.8 2.5% Net income $100.5 9.4% $120.4 12.1% $294.0 9.3% $354.8 11.8% Revenues Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 112.4 10.5 % $ 108.4 10.8 % $ 328.8 10.4 % $ 337.7 11.2 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 128.9 12.1 % 121.6 12.2 % 379.3 12.1 % 372.9 12.4 % Supply chain 646.1 60.4 % 588.8 59.0 % 1,902.2 60.5 % 1,760.1 58.4 % International franchise royalties and fees 67.1 6.3 % 70.6 7.1 % 202.8 6.4 % 207.1 6.9 % U.S. franchise advertising 114.2 10.7 % 108.6 10.9 % 331.9 10.6 % 336.3 11.1 % Total revenues $ 1,068.6 100.0 % $ 998.0 100.0 % $ 3,144.9 100.0 % $ 3,014.2 100.0 % Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties, advertising contributions and fees from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 112.4 31.6 % $ 108.4 32.0 % $ 328.8 31.6 % $ 337.7 32.3 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 128.9 36.3 % 121.6 35.9 % 379.3 36.5 % 372.9 35.6 % U.S. franchise advertising 114.2 32.1 % 108.6 32.1 % 331.9 31.9 % 336.3 32.1 % U.S. stores $ 355.5 100.0 % $ 338.6 100.0 % $ 1,039.9 100.0 % $ 1,047.0 100.0 % 18 U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $4.0 million, or 3.7%, in the third quarter of 2022 due to an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Purchase, and was partially offset by a decline in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $9.0 million, or 2.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due to a decline in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Purchase. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 1.9% and 7.3% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 8.9% and 2.0% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $7.3 million, or 6.0%, in the third quarter of 2022 due to an increase in U.S. franchise same store sales, as well as an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and higher revenues from fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $6.3 million, or 1.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to an increase in revenues from fees paid by our franchisees for the use of our technology platforms as well as an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. These increases were partially offset by a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees were negatively impacted by the 2022 Store Purchase in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 2.2% in the third quarter of 2022 and declined 1.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. franchise same store sales declined 1.5% in the third quarter of 2021 and increased 5.1% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $5.6 million, or 5.2%, in the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to an increase in U.S. franchise same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth, partially offset by the 2022 Store Purchase. Approximately $2.8 million in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in the third quarter of 2021, which did not recur in the third quarter of 2022, also contributed to the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenue in the third quarter of 2022. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising decreased $4.4 million, or 1.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales. Additionally, the Company recorded approximately $2.3 million more in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2021, which also contributed to the decrease in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. The decrease in U.S. franchise advertising revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 was partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth, but was partially offset by the 2022 Store Purchase. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $57.3 million, or 9.7%, in the third quarter of 2022, and increased $142.1 million, or 8.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due to higher market basket pricing to stores, partially offset by lower order volumes at our U.S. franchise stores during the respective periods. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 13.4% during the third quarter of 2022, which resulted in an estimated $69.0 million increase in supply chain revenues. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 13.5% during the three fiscal quarters of 2022, which resulted in an estimated $202.2 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees decreased $3.5 million, or 5.0%, in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $4.3 million, or 2.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $7.9 million and $18.0 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. A decline in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 also contributed to the decreases in international franchise revenues in the respective periods. An increase in the average number of international franchise stores open during the respective periods, resulting from net store growth, partially offset the declines in revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales declined 1.8% and 0.8% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 8.8% and 11.4% in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. 19 Cost of Sales / Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Total revenues $ 1,068.6 100.0 % $ 998.0 100.0 % $ 3,144.9 100.0 % $ 3,014.2 100.0 % Total cost of sales 686.7 64.3 % 612.8 61.4 % 2,008.2 63.9 % 1,832.1 60.8 % Gross margin $ 381.9 35.7 % $ 385.2 38.6 % $ 1,136.7 36.1 % $ 1,182.0 39.2 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate the related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) decreased $3.3 million, or 0.9%, in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $45.3 million, or 3.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, due primarily to lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues, as well as higher food, labor and delivery costs. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar gross margins remain unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin decreased 2.9 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased 3.1 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 7.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased 8.0 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. Supply chain gross margin decreased 1.7 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased 1.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. These changes in gross margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Revenues $ 112.4 100.0 % $ 108.4 100.0 % $ 328.8 100.0 % $ 337.7 100.0 % Cost of sales 98.6 87.7 % 86.9 80.2 % 280.0 85.2 % 260.7 77.2 % Store gross margin $ 13.8 12.3 % $ 21.5 19.8 % $ 48.8 14.8 % $ 77.0 22.8 % U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $7.7 million, or 35.8%, in the third quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher food and labor costs. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased $28.2 million, or 36.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to lower same store sales, as well as higher food and labor costs. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 7.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased 8.0 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Gross Margin Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Revenues $ 646.1 100.0 % $ 588.8 100.0 % $ 1,902.2 100.0 % $ 1,760.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 588.2 91.0 % 525.9 89.3 % 1,728.2 90.8 % 1,571.4 89.3 % Supply chain gross margin $ 57.9 9.0 % $ 62.9 10.7 % $ 174.0 9.2 % $ 188.7 10.7 % Supply chain gross margin decreased $5.0 million, or 8.0%, in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $14.7 million, or 7.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to higher delivery and labor costs. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, supply chain gross margin decreased 1.7 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022 and decreased 1.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due to higher food and delivery costs. The increases in food and delivery costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues resulted from macroeconomic inflationary pressures in the U.S., as well as lower sales leverage. 20 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $5.1 million, or 5.3%, in the third quarter of 2022 driven primarily by lower labor costs. General and administrative expenses decreased $2.3 million, or 0.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 driven primarily by lower labor costs, partially offset by higher travel expenses, amortization expense for capitalized software and non-cash equity-based compensation expense. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $5.6 million, or 5.2%, in the third quarter of 2022, and decreased $4.4 million, or 1.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 consistent with the changes in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded a $2.5 million unrealized gain on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 6) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of our additional $40.0 million investment. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in the third quarter or three fiscal quarters of 2022, or the third quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9%, in the third quarter of 2022 driven primarily by higher interest income. Interest expense, net increased $5.4 million, or 4.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 driven by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”), partially offset by higher interest income. Our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.7% in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 from 3.8% in the third quarter of 2021 and from 3.9% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due to lower interest rates on the debt outstanding as a result of the 2021 Recapitalization. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense increased $16.9 million, or 117.6%, in the third quarter of 2022 due to a higher effective tax rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 23.8% during the third quarter of 2022 as compared to 10.7% in the third quarter of 2021. Income tax expense increased $14.3 million, or 19.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 due to a higher effective tax rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 23.3% during the three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to 17.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. The higher effective tax rate in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 was driven in part by a 9.8 and 4.0 percentage point change in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the respective periods in 2021. The decreases in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation were a result of fewer stock option exercises in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the respective periods in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was also a result of lower foreign tax credits in the respective periods of 2022. 21 Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Third Quarter of 2022 Third Quarter of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. stores $ 100.5 $ 102.0 $ 301.9 $ 321.3 Supply chain 49.9 53.6 149.9 164.7 International franchise 53.8 57.3 161.7 168.1 Other (2.9 ) (10.0 ) (16.3 ) (25.7 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $1.4 million, or 1.4%, in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $7.7 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, and was partially offset by the $7.3 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $19.4 million, or 6.0%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $28.2 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, and was partially offset by the $6.3 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income decreased $3.7 million, or 6.9%, in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $5.0 million decrease in supply chain gross margin discussed above. Supply chain Segment Income decreased $14.8 million, or 9.0%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $14.7 million decrease in supply chain gross margin discussed above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income decreased $3.5 million, or 6.2%, in the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $3.5 million decrease in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise Segment Income decreased $6.4 million, or 3.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $4.3 million decrease in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income increased $7.1 million, or 70.8%, in the third quarter of 2022, and increased $9.5 million, or 36.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to lower labor costs. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities, resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of September 11, 2022, we had working capital of $55.2 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $184.6 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $181.2 million and advertising fund liabilities of $173.3 million. Working capital as of September 11, 2022 included unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $114.8 million. 22 Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2022, we continued to increase global retail sales (excluding foreign currency impact), which continued our ability to generate positive cash provided by operating activities. As of September 11, 2022, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of September 11, 2022, we had $120.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $35.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2022, we repaid $60.0 million of the outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Additionally, subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2022, on September 16, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), certain of our subsidiaries issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $120.0 million of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes (the “2022 Variable Funding Notes”). The 2022 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the Closing Date. Our existing 2021 Variable Funding Notes also remain in place. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of September 11, 2022, we had $136.6 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.8 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $184.6 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 11, 2022, we also held $157.7 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of September 11, 2022, we had approximately $5.15 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.8 million was classified as a current liability. As of September 11, 2022, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $12.9 million in the remainder of 2022, $51.5 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. Additionally, as of September 11, 2022, we had $120.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then-outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x, and accordingly, resumed making the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our notes beginning in the second quarter of 2021. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. 23 During the third quarter of 2022, we repurchased and retired 490,789 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $196.1 million. During the three fiscal quarters of 2022, we repurchased and retired 739,847 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $293.7 million. As of September 11, 2022, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $410.4 million. Dividends On July 19, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2022, which was paid on September 30, 2022. We had approximately $39.6 million accrued for common stock dividends at September 11, 2022. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 11, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2022 to be paid on December 30, 2022. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 330.2 $ 484.6 Net cash used in investing activities (58.7 ) (90.3 ) Net cash used in financing activities (304.3 ) (228.1 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.6 ) 0.1 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (33.4 ) $ 166.2 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $154.4 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a $53.5 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2021 due to receipts for advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 as well as the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $52.1 million. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities, accounts payable, income taxes and prepaid expenses in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2021. Additionally, net income decreased $60.8 million. However, this decrease in net income included a $12.0 million increase in non-cash adjustments, resulting in an overall decrease to cash provided by operating activities in the three fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2021 of $48.8 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $58.7 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, which primarily consisted of $50.5 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). As a result of the 2022 Store Purchase, we also acquired 23 U.S. franchise stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees in the first quarter of 2022 for $6.8 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $304.3 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, which primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately $293.7 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, dividend payments of $79.7 million, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $41.1 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $10.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes of $120.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.3 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2021 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 2, 2022. 24 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at September 11, 2022, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. As of September 11, 2022, we had $120.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2022, we entered into a facility for our 2022 Variable Funding Notes which bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on SOFR. Our existing 2021 Variable Funding Notes also remain in place. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. Our existing fixed rate notes have various maturities such that we would not be required to refinance all of our debt at one time. Refer to the original scheduled principal payments disclosed within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.3% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2022, approximately 6.4% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2022, approximately 7.1% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2021 and approximately 6.9% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $18.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2022. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended September 11, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 26 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at June 19, 2022 and January 2, 2022: At June 19, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 76,381 $ 76,381 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,426 117,426 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,740 13,740 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 150,752 150,752 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 At January 2, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 87,384 $ 87,384 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 115,185 115,185 — — Investments in marketable securities 15,433 15,433 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 140,115 140,115 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd, a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“DPC Dash”). Through its subsidiaries, DPC Dash serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 125.8 million in the second quarter or two fiscal quarters of 2022 . The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at June 20, 2021 as a result of the additional investment made in the first quarter of 2021. Two Fiscal Quarters Ended June 20, 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, Unrealized June 20, 2021 Purchases Gain 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 10 F air Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. M anagement estimated the approximate fair values of the Company's 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 notes as follows: June 19, 2022 January 2, 2022 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 756,000 $ 737,856 $ 760,000 $ 777,480 2017 Ten-Year Notes 957,500 901,008 962,500 1,000,038 2018 7.5-Year Notes 410,125 395,361 412,250 420,907 2018 9.25-Year Notes 386,000 368,244 388,000 407,788 2019 Ten-Year Notes 659,813 589,872 663,188 693,031 2021 7.5-Year Notes 841,500 720,324 845,750 849,133 2021 Ten-Year Notes 990,000 832,590 995,000 1,017,885 The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at June 19, 2022 or January 2, 2022 . 6.

New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has not yet adopted the following standard. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. ASU 2020-04 may currently be adopted and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 13 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2022 and 2021 second quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended June 19, 2022 and June 20, 2021, respectively. The 2022 and 2021 two fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the twenty-four-week periods ended June 19, 2022 and June 20, 2021, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 19,200 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of June 19, 2022, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the United States. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. Second Quarter of 2022 Highlights Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Highlights 14 Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, Domino ’ s experienced global retail sales growth during the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. U.S. same store sales declined 2.9% and 3.3% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively, rolling over increases in U.S. same store sales of 3.5% and 8.1% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. The decline in U.S. same store sales in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 was attributable to lower order counts due in part to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets and economic stimulus activity in the U.S in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which did not recur in the respective periods of 2022. These decreases were partially offset by a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from higher menu and national offer pricing, as well as more items purchased per transaction and increases to our average delivery fee. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) declined 2.2% and 0.5% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively, rolling over increases in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) of 13.9% and 12.8% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. The decline in same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 in our international business was driven in part by a value added tax holiday in the United Kingdom in the second quarter of 2021 that did not recur in the second quarter of 2022. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, we experienced significant inflationary pressures in our commodity, labor and fuel costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., which had a significant impact on our overall operating results as compared to the respective periods of fiscal 2021. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 233 net stores in the second quarter of 2022, bringing our year-to-date total to 446. We had 22 net stores open in the U.S. and 211 net stores open internationally during the second quarter of 2022. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact), emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. 15 Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. stores (0.6)% +7.4% (1.0)% +11.1% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +3.7% +29.5% +6.0% +20.6% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +1.5% +17.1% +2.5% +15.6% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores (1) (9.2)% (2.6)% (9.8)% +1.6% U.S. franchise stores (1) (2.5)% +3.9% (2.9)% +8.5% U.S. stores (2.9)% +3.5% (3.3)% +8.1% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) (2.2)% +13.9% (0.5)% +12.8% (1) During the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees (the “2022 Store Purchase”). The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. Company-owned stores in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022. Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 112.5 32.0 % $ 116.6 32.4 % $ 216.4 31.6 % $ 229.3 32.4 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 128.1 36.4 % 126.8 35.3 % 250.4 36.6 % 251.3 35.5 % U.S. franchise advertising 111.1 31.6 % 116.3 32.3 % 217.7 31.8 % 227.7 32.1 % U.S. stores $ 351.7 100.0 % $ 359.8 100.0 % $ 684.5 100.0 % $ 708.4 100.0 % 17 U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $4.1 million, or 3.5%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $12.9 million, or 5.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due to a decline in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth and the 2022 Store Purchase. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 9.2% and 9.8% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. U.S. Company-owned same store sales declined 2.6% in the second quarter of 2021 and increased 1.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $1.3 million, or 1.0%, in the second quarter of 2022 due to an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, as well as an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. These increases in revenues were partially offset by a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees decreased $0.9 million, or 0.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales, and was partially offset by an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms, as well as an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees were negatively impacted by the 2022 Store Purchase in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. franchise same store sales declined 2.5% and 2.9% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.9% and 8.5% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising decreased $5.3 million, or 4.5%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $10.0 million, or 4.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to a decline in U.S. franchise same store sales and to a lesser extent, the 2022 Store Purchase. Approximately $2.6 million and $5.1 million in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively, also contributed to the decreases in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $43.6 million, or 7.2%, in the second quarter of 2022, and increased $84.8 million, or 7.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due to higher market basket pricing to stores, partially offset by lower order volumes at our U.S. franchise stores during the respective periods. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 15.2% during the second quarter of 2022, which resulted in an estimated $77.1 million increase in supply chain revenues. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 13.6% during the two fiscal quarters of 2022 which resulted in an estimated $133.2 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees decreased $2.8 million, or 4.1%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $0.8 million, or 0.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $5.9 million and $10.1 million in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. A decline in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 also contributed to the decreases in international franchise revenues in the respective periods. An increase in the average number of international franchise stores open during the respective periods, resulting from net store growth, partially offset the declines in revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales declined 2.2% and 0.5% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 13.9% and 12.8% in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively. 18 Cost of Sales / Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Consolidated revenues $ 1,065.2 100.0 % $ 1,032.5 100.0 % $ 2,076.3 100.0 % $ 2,016.2 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 678.9 63.7 % 624.8 60.5 % 1,321.4 63.6 % 1,219.3 60.5 % Consolidated gross margin $ 386.3 36.3 % $ 407.7 39.5 % $ 754.9 36.4 % $ 796.8 39.5 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated gross margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) decreased $21.4 million, or 5.3%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $42.0 million, or 5.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues, as well as higher food, labor and delivery costs and lower global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on gross margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and gross margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar gross margins remain unchanged. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated gross margin decreased 3.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased 3.1 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2022. U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 8.1 percentage points in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased 8.0 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2022. Supply chain gross margin decreased 1.5 percentage points in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022. These changes in gross margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Revenues $ 112.5 100.0 % $ 116.6 100.0 % $ 216.4 100.0 % $ 229.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 94.1 83.6 % 88.0 75.5 % 181.4 83.8 % 173.8 75.8 % Store gross margin $ 18.4 16.4 % $ 28.6 24.5 % $ 35.0 16.2 % $ 55.6 24.2 % U.S. Company-owned store gross margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $10.1 million, or 35.5%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $20.6 million, or 37.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to lower same store sales, as well as higher food costs. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store gross margin decreased 8.1 percentage points in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased 8.0 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2022. These changes in gross margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Gross Margin Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Revenues $ 646.6 100.0 % $ 603.0 100.0 % $ 1,256.1 100.0 % $ 1,171.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 584.9 90.5 % 536.8 89.0 % 1,140.0 90.8 % 1,045.6 89.3 % Supply chain gross margin $ 61.7 9.5 % $ 66.2 11.0 % $ 116.1 9.2 % $ 125.7 10.7 % Supply chain gross margin decreased $4.5 million, or 6.7%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $9.6 million, or 7.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due primarily to higher labor and delivery costs. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, supply chain gross margin decreased 1.5 percentage points in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 due to higher food and delivery costs. The increases in food and delivery costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues resulted from macroeconomic inflationary pressures in the U.S., as well as lower sales leverage. Lower insurance expense resulting from favorable claims experience partially offset the decreases in supply chain gross margin as a percentage of supply chain revenues in the second quarter of 2022. 19 General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $3.4 million, or 3.4%, in the second quarter of 2022 driven primarily by lower labor costs, partially offset by higher professional fees and travel expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million, or 1.5%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 driven primarily by higher professional fees, travel expenses, non-cash equity-based compensation expense and amortization expense for capitalized software. These increases were partially offset by lower labor costs. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses decreased $5.3 million, or 4.5%, in the second quarter of 2022, and decreased $10.0 million, or 4.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 consistent with the decreases in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded a $2.5 million unrealized gain on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of our additional $40.0 million investment. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount in the second quarter or two fiscal quarters of 2022, or the second quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $1.2 million, or 2.6%, in the second quarter of 2022 driven primarily by approximately $2.3 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2021 in connection with our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”), partially offset by higher average borrowings resulting from the 2021 Recapitalization. Interest expense, net increased $6.2 million, or 7.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 driven by higher average borrowings resulting from the 2021 Recapitalization. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate was 3.8% in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 and 2021. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense increased $2.5 million, or 8.8%, in the second quarter of 2022 due to a higher effective tax rate, and was partially offset by a decrease in income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 23.2% during the second quarter of 2022 as compared to 19.6% in the second quarter of 2021. Income tax expense decreased $2.6 million, or 4.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 due to a decrease in income before provision for income taxes, but was partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate increased to 23.0% during the two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to 20.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. The higher effective tax rate in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 was driven in part by a 2.2 and 1.4 percentage point change in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, respectively. The decreases in excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation were a result of fewer stock option exercises in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the respective periods in 2021. The increase in the effective tax rate was also a result of lower foreign tax credits. Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Second Quarter of 2022 Second Quarter of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 U.S. stores $ 104.1 $ 111.8 $ 201.3 $ 219.3 Supply chain 53.6 58.6 100.0 111.1 International franchise 52.9 56.4 107.9 110.8 Other (5.6 ) (9.6 ) (13.3 ) (15.7 ) 20 U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $7.8 million, or 7.0%, in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $10.1 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, and was partially offset by the $1.3 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $17.9 million, or 8.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $20.6 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store gross margin, as well as the $0.9 million decrease in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income decreased $5.0 million, or 8.5%, in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $4.5 million decrease in supply chain gross margin discussed above. Supply chain Segment Income decreased $11.2 million, or 10.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $9.6 million decrease in supply chain gross margin discussed above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income decreased $3.5 million, or 6.2%, in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $2.8 million decrease in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise Segment Income decreased $2.9 million, or 2.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the $0.8 million decrease in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income increased $4.0 million, or 41.6%, in the second quarter of 2022, and increased $2.4 million, or 15.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to lower labor costs partially offset by higher professional fees and travel expenses in the respective periods. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of June 19, 2022, we had working capital of $104.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $158.2 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $182.5 million and advertising fund liabilities of $175.1 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $114.4 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2022, we continued to increase global retail sales (excluding foreign currency impact), which continued our ability to generate positive operating cash flows. As of June 19, 2022, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of June 19, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and $155.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 21 Restricted Cash As of June 19, 2022, we had $110.6 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.4 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $158.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of June 19, 2022, we also held $164.1 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of June 19, 2022, we had approximately $5.05 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.7 million was classified as a current liability. As of June 19, 2022, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $25.8 million in the remainder of 2022, $51.5 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then-outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x, and accordingly, resumed making the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our notes beginning in the second quarter of 2021. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. During the second quarter of 2022, we repurchased and retired 148,248 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $50.0 million. During the two fiscal quarters of 2022, we repurchased and retired 249,058 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $97.7 million. As of June 19, 2022, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $606.4 million. Dividends On April 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2022, which was paid on June 30, 2022. We had approximately $40.6 million accrued for common stock dividends at June 19, 2022. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, on July 19, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2022 to be paid on September 30, 2022. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Two Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 153.4 $ 295.4 Net cash used in investing activities (39.9 ) (72.9 ) Net cash used in financing activities (166.7 ) (101.2 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (0.6 ) 0.3 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (53.9 ) $ 121.6 22 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $142.0 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $81.7 million. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of payments on accrued liabilities, income taxes and prepaid expenses, as well as the timing of collections on accounts receivable in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2021. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $27.7 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2021 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts for advertising contributions. Additionally, net income decreased $40.9 million. However, this decrease in net income included an $8.3 million increase in non-cash adjustments, resulting in an overall decrease to cash provided by operating activities in the two fiscal quarters of 2022 as compared to the two fiscal quarters of 2021 of $32.6 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $39.9 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, which primarily consisted of $32.7 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). As a result of the 2022 Store Purchase, we also acquired 23 U.S. franchise stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees in the first quarter of 2022 for $6.8 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $166.7 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, which primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately $97.7 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, dividend payments of $39.7 million, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $27.5 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $2.4 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.5 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2021 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 2, 2022. 23 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. The following cautionary statements are being made pursuant to the provisions of the Act and with the intention of obtaining the benefits of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Act. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “should,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “potential,” “outlook” and similar terms and phrases that concern our strategy, plans or intentions, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements address various matters including information concerning future results of operations and business strategy, our anticipated profitability, estimates in same store sales growth, the growth of our U.S. and international business, our ability to service our indebtedness, our future cash flows, our operating performance, trends in our business and other descriptions of future events reflect the Company’s expectations based upon currently available information and data. While we believe these expectations and projections are based on reasonable assumptions, such forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are more fully described under the section headed “Risk Factors” in this filing and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the section headed “Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to: our substantial increased indebtedness as a result of our recapitalization transactions and our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance or renegotiate key terms of that indebtedness in the future; the impact a downgrade in our credit rating may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations; our future financial performance and our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness; our ability to manage difficulties associated with or related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of COVID-19 and related regulations and policies on our business and supply chain, including impacts on the availability of labor; labor shortages or changes in operating expenses resulting from changes in prices of food (particularly cheese), fuel and other commodity costs, labor, utilities, insurance, employee benefits and other operating costs; the effectiveness of our advertising, operations and promotional initiatives; shortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products and store equipment; the strength of our brand, including our ability to compete in the U.S. and internationally in our intensely competitive industry, including the food service and food delivery markets; the impact of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies on our business, brand and reputation; the impact of new or improved technologies and alternative methods of delivery on consumer behavior; new product, digital ordering and concept developments by us, and other food-industry competitors; our ability to maintain good relationships with and attract new franchisees, and franchisees’ ability to successfully manage their operations without negatively impacting our royalty payments and fees or our brand’s reputation; our ability to successfully implement cost-saving strategies; our ability and that of our franchisees to successfully operate in the current and future credit environment; changes in the level of consumer spending given general economic conditions, including interest rates, energy prices and consumer confidence; our ability and that of our franchisees to open new restaurants and keep existing restaurants in operation; the impact that widespread illness, health epidemics or general health concerns, severe weather conditions and natural disasters may have on our business and the economies of the countries where we operate; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in income tax rates; our ability to retain or replace our executive officers and other key members of management and our ability to adequately staff our stores and supply chain centers with qualified personnel; our ability to find and/or retain suitable real estate for our stores and supply chain centers; changes in government legislation and regulations, including changes in laws and regulations regarding information privacy, payment methods and consumer protection and social media; adverse legal judgments or settlements; food-borne illness or contamination of products or food tampering; data breaches, power loss, technological failures, user error or other cyber risks threatening us or our franchisees; the impact that environmental, social and governance matters may have on our business and reputation; the effect of war, terrorism, catastrophic events or climate change; our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares; changes in consumer tastes, spending and traffic patterns and demographic trends; actions by activist investors; changes in accounting policies; and adequacy of our insurance coverage. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this filing might not occur.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at June 19, 2022, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of June 19, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. Our existing fixed rate notes have various maturities such that we would not be required to refinance all of our debt at one time. Refer to the original scheduled principal payments disclosed within the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.3% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2022, approximately 6.5% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2022, approximately 6.7% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2021 and approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2021 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $12.1 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2022. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Russell J. Weiner, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Sandeep Reddy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Weiner and Mr. Reddy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended June 19, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 25 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

Segment Information The following tables summarize revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments. Intersegment revenues are comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from the supply chain segment to the Company-owned stores in the U.S. stores segment.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at March 27, 2022 and January 2, 2022: At March 27, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 130,561 $ 130,561 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 119,832 119,832 — — Investments in marketable securities 14,417 14,417 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 139,780 139,780 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 At January 2, 2022 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 87,384 $ 87,384 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 115,185 115,185 — — Investments in marketable securities 15,433 15,433 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 140,115 140,115 — — Investments 125,840 — — 125,840 The Company holds a non-controlling interest in DPC Dash Ltd, a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“DPC Dash”). Through its subsidiaries, DPC Dash serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in DPC Dash’s senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 125.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 . The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in DPC Dash from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at March 28, 2021. Fiscal Quarter Ended March 28, 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, Unrealized March 28, 2021 Purchases Gain 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 9 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the Company's 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2021 notes as follows: March 27, 2022 January 2, 2022 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Notes $ 758,000 $ 764,064 $ 760,000 $ 777,480 2017 Ten-Year Notes 960,000 951,360 962,500 1,000,038 2018 7.5-Year Notes 411,188 411,599 412,250 420,907 2018 9.25-Year Notes 387,000 386,226 388,000 407,788 2019 Ten-Year Notes 661,500 635,702 663,188 693,031 2021 7.5-Year Notes 843,625 773,604 845,750 849,133 2021 Ten-Year Notes 992,500 912,108 995,000 1,017,885 The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at March 27, 2022 or January 2, 2022 . 6.

Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Rent expense for certain short-term supply chain center tractor and trailer rentals was $ 2.2 million and $ 1.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively. Variable rent expense and rent expense for other short-term leases were immaterial in both the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2021.

New Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. If the Company further needs to renegotiate its loan documents, the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 may currently be adopted and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 12 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2022 and 2021 first quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended March 27, 2022 and March 28, 2021, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world with more than 19,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of March 27, 2022, and operates two distinct service models within its stores with a significant business in both delivery and carryout. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the United States. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. We believe we have a proven business model for success, which includes leading with technology, service and product innovation and leveraging our global scale, which has historically driven strong returns for our shareholders. First Quarter of 2022 Highlights Domino ’ s experienced global retail sales growth during the first quarter of 2022. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. We continued our strong international same store sales performance with the 113 th consecutive quarter of positive international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact). U.S. same store sales declined 3.6% in the first quarter of 2022, rolling over an increase in U.S. same store sales of 13.4% in the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in U.S. same store sales was attributable in part to lower order counts resulting from labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets, as well as economic stimulus activity in the U.S in the first quarter of 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which did not recur in the first quarter of 2022. The decline in U.S. store order counts was partially offset by a higher average ticket per transaction resulting from higher menu prices as well as more items purchased per transaction and increases to our average delivery fee. 13 During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced significant inflationary pressures in our commodity, labor and fuel costs resulting from the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., which had a significant impact on our overall operating results as compared to the prior year quarter. Internationally, we continued to experience increases in retail sales during the first quarter of 2022. Our U.S. and international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 213 net stores in the first quarter of 2022. We had 37 net stores open in the U.S. and 176 net stores open internationally during the first quarter of 2022. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our sales growth, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 U.S. stores (1.4)% +15.3% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +8.4% +12.8% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +3.6% +14.0% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores (1) (10.5)% +6.3% U.S. franchise stores (1) (3.2)% +13.9% U.S. stores (3.6)% +13.4% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +1.2% +11.8% (1) During the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees. The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. Company-owned stores in the first quarter of 2022. 14 Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance. U.S. Company- owned Stores U.S. Franchise Stores Total U.S. Stores International Stores Total Store count at January 2, 2022 375 6,185 6,560 12,288 18,848 Openings 2 38 40 217 257 Closings (1) — (3 ) (3 ) (41 ) (44 ) Transfers (2) 23 (23 ) — — — Store count at March 27, 2022 400 6,197 6,597 12,464 19,061 First quarter 2022 net store growth 2 35 37 176 213 Trailing four quarters net store growth 13 193 206 1,036 1,242 (1) Temporary store closures are not treated as store closures and affected stores are included in the ending store count. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of March 27, 2022, there were approximately 200 international stores temporarily closed. (2) Net store growth does not include the effect of transfers. During the first quarter of 2022, we purchased 23 U.S. franchised stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 15 U.S. Stores Revenues First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 103.9 31.2 % $ 112.7 32.3 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 122.3 36.8 % 124.5 35.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 106.6 32.0 % 111.4 32.0 % U.S. stores $ 332.8 100.0 % $ 348.6 100.0 % U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $8.8 million, or 7.8%, in the first quarter of 2022 due to a decrease in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period. U.S. Company-owned same store sales decreased 10.5% in the first quarter of 2022 and increased 6.3% in the first quarter of 2021. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees decreased $2.2 million, or 1.8%, in the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to a decrease in U.S. franchise same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. U.S. franchise same store sales decreased 3.2% in the first quarter of 2022 and increased 13.9% in the first quarter of 2021. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising decreased $4.8 million, or 4.3%, in the first quarter of 2022 due to a decrease in U.S. franchise same store sales as well as approximately $2.5 million in advertising incentives related to certain brand promotions. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $41.2 million, or 7.3%, in the first quarter of 2022 due to higher market basket pricing to stores, partially offset by lower order volumes at our U.S. franchise stores. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 11.9% during the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in an estimated $56.1 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $2.1 million, or 3.1%, in the first quarter of 2022 due primarily to higher international retail sales resulting from international same store sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $4.3 million in the first quarter of 2022 partially offset the increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.2% in the first quarter of 2022 and increased 11.8% in the first quarter of 2021. Cost of Sales / Operating Margin First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 Consolidated revenues $ 1,011.1 100.0 % $ 983.7 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 642.5 63.5 % 594.5 60.4 % Consolidated operating margin $ 368.6 36.5 % $ 389.2 39.6 % Consolidated cost of sales consists of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) decreased $20.6 million, or 5.3%, in the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues, as well as higher food, labor and delivery costs and lower global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. Additionally, as our market basket prices fluctuate, our revenues and margin percentages in our supply chain segment also fluctuate; however, actual product-level dollar margins remain unchanged. 16 As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin decreased 3.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 8.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022. Supply chain operating margin decreased 1.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022. These changes in operating margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Operating Margin First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 Revenues $ 103.9 100.0 % $ 112.7 100.0 % Cost of sales 87.4 84.1 % 85.7 76.1 % Store operating margin $ 16.5 15.9 % $ 27.0 23.9 % U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $10.5 million, or 38.8%, in the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to lower same store sales, as well as higher food costs. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 8.0 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. Supply Chain Operating Margin First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 Revenues $ 609.5 100.0 % $ 568.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 555.2 91.1 % 508.8 89.5 % Supply chain operating margin $ 54.4 8.9 % $ 59.5 10.5 % Supply chain operating margin decreased $5.1 million, or 8.6%, in the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher labor and delivery costs . As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 1.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2022 due to higher food, labor and delivery costs resulting from inflationary pressures due to the macroeconomic environment in the U.S., as well as lower sales leverage. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $6.2 million, or 6.8%, in the first quarter of 2022, driven primarily by higher labor costs, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense, as well as higher amortization expense for capitalized software. These increases were partially offset by lower variable performance-based compensation expense. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses decreased $4.8 million, or 4.3%, in the first quarter of 2022, consistent with the decrease in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and other activities that promote the Domino’s brand and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income During the first quarter of 2021, we recorded a $2.5 million unrealized gain on our investment in DPC Dash (Note 5) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional $40.0 million investment we made in the first quarter of 2021. We did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $125.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. 17 Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $7.4 million, or 18.8%, in the first quarter of 2022 driven by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”). The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.7% in the first quarter of 2022 from 3.9% in the first quarter of 2021, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding due to the 2021 Recapitalization. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense decreased $5.1 million, or 16.1%, in the first quarter of 2022 due to a decrease in income before provision for income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 22.7% during the first quarter of 2022 as compared to 21.3% in the first quarter of 2021. The higher effective tax rate was driven in part by a 0.5 percentage point change in the impact of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, as a result of fewer stock option exercises in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 U.S. stores $ 97.3 $ 107.4 Supply chain 46.3 52.6 International franchise 55.0 54.5 Other (7.7 ) (6.1 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income decreased $10.1 million, or 9.4%, in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $10.5 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store operating margin, as well as the $2.2 million decrease in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, each as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income decreased $6.2 million, or 11.8%, in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $5.1 million decrease in operating margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $0.6 million, or 1.1%, in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the $2.1 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, therefore changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income decreased $1.6 million, or 26.6%, in the first quarter of 2022, due primarily to higher labor, professional fees and travel costs. These increases were partially offset by lower variable performance-based compensation expense. 18 Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities resulting in efficient deployment of working capital. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits variations in our working capital requirements. These factors allow us to manage our working capital and our ongoing cash flows from operations to invest in our business and other strategic opportunities, pay dividends and repurchase and retire shares of our common stock. As of March 27, 2022, we had working capital of $90.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $168.2 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $175.5 million and advertising fund liabilities of $168.2 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $165.0 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first quarter of 2022, we experienced an increase in international same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) versus the comparable periods in the prior year. While our U.S. same store sales declined, both the U.S. and international businesses grew store counts in the first quarter of 2022. These factors contributed to our global retail sales growth realized in the first quarter of 2022, which resulted in our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. As of March 27, 2022, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of March 27, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and $155.8 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $44.2 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our 2021 Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of March 27, 2022, we had $120.9 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.1 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $168.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of March 27, 2022, we also held $153.7 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of March 27, 2022, we had approximately $5.06 billion of long-term debt, of which $55.6 million was classified as a current liability. As of March 27, 2022, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $38.6 million in the remainder of 2022, $51.5 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then-outstanding notes in the first quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x, and accordingly, resumed making the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our notes beginning in the second quarter of 2021. The notes are subject to certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a debt service coverage ratio calculation. The covenant requires a minimum coverage ratio of 1.75x total debt service to securitized net cash flow, as defined in the related agreements. In the event that certain covenants are not met, the notes may become due and payable on an accelerated schedule. 19 Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. During the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased and retired 100,810 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $47.7 million. As of March 27, 2022, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $656.4 million. Dividends On February 24, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of March 15, 2022, which was paid on March 30, 2022. We had approximately $40.6 million accrued for common stock dividends at March 27, 2022. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, on April 26, 2022, our Board of Directors declared a $1.10 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2022 to be paid on June 30, 2022. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) First Quarter of 2022 First Quarter of 2021 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 78.8 $ 152.9 Net cash used in investing activities (20.6 ) (56.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (62.1 ) (23.1 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 0.4 0.2 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (3.6 ) $ 73.5 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $74.1 million in the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $32.2 million. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of payments on accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income taxes as well as the timing and pricing of inventory in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $23.3 million negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to payments for advertising activities outpacing receipts for advertising contributions. Additionally, net income decreased $26.8 million; however, this included an $8.2 million increase in non-cash adjustments, resulting in an overall decrease to cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021 of $18.6 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $20.6 million in the first quarter of 2022, which primarily consisted of $12.5 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). We also acquired 23 U.S. franchise stores from certain of our existing U.S. franchisees for $6.8 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $62.1 million in the first quarter of 2022, which primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately $47.7 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $13.9 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $0.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.3 million. Critical Accounting Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2021 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be long-lived assets, casualty insurance reserves and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since January 2, 2022. 20 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at March 27, 2022, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of March 27, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. Severe increases in commodity prices or food costs, including as a result of inflation, could affect the global and U.S. economies and could also adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2021 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (who is also serving as the Company’s principal financial officer), Richard E. Allison, Jr., performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended March 27, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 22 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims.

During the third quarter of 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 391,007 shares of its common stock, including 238,190 shares received at settlement of the ASR Agreement and 152,817 shares of its common stock under this Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $ 79.7 million. During the three fiscal quarters of 2021, the Company repurchased and retired 2,469,473 shares of its common stock, including the 2,250,786 shares of common stock repurchased under the ASR Agreement and 218,687 shares of common stock repurchased under the Company's Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $ 1.1 billion. As of September 12, 2021, the end of the third quarter, the Company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $ 920.3 million . Subsequent to the end of the third quarter and through October 12, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired an additional 205,145 shares of common stock for a total of approximately $ 100.1 million. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 12, 2021 , the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $ 0.94 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2021 , to be paid on December 30, 2021 . The following table summarizes changes in stockholders’ deficit for the third quarter of 2020.

Recapitalization On April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), the Company completed a recapitalization transaction (the “2021 Recapitalization”) in which certain of the Company’s subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The new notes consist of $ 850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”) and $ 1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of September 12, 2021, the 2021 Notes had scheduled principal payments of $ 4.6 million in 2021, $ 18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027, $ 804.8 million in 2028, $ 10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $ 905.0 million in 2031. Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $ 1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $ 200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, the Company’s previous $ 200.0 million variable funding note facility was canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $ 291.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $ 582.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, prefund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment of the 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, the Company expensed approximately $ 2.0 million for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Additionally, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company capitalized $ 14.9 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into interest expense over the 7.5 and 10-year expected terms of the 2021 Notes. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0 x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment for its then-outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of the Company’s outstanding notes were classified as long-term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0 x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its notes in the second quarter of 2021. On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into the $ 1.0 billion ASR Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization to pay the counterparty $ 1.0 billion in cash and received and retired 2,012,596 shares of its common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, the Company received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of its common stock at an average price of $ 444.29 . 10 6. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at September 12, 2021 and January 3, 2021: At September 12, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 247,009 $ 247,009 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 131,725 131,725 — — Investments in marketable securities 15,103 15,103 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 151,763 151,763 — — Investments 82,500 — — 82,500 At January 3, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 151,502 $ 151,502 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,595 126,595 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,251 13,251 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 104,197 104,197 — — Investments 40,000 — — 40,000 During the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands Ltd., a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Dash Brands”), for $ 40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in Dash Brands’ senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company invested an additional $ 40.0 million in Dash Brands based on Dash Brands’ achievement of certain pre-established performance conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a positive adjustment of $ 2.5 million to the original carrying amount of $ 40.0 million resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This amount was recorded in other income in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 82.5 million in the second or third quarter of 2021. The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Dash Brands from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at September 12, 2021. Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, Unrealized September 12, 2021 Purchases Gain 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 11 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes, the 2019 fixed rate notes and the 2021 fixed rate notes as follows: September 12, 2021 January 3, 2021 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 762,000 $ 794,766 $ 766,000 $ 809,662 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes — — 582,000 582,582 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 965,000 1,028,690 970,000 1,035,960 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes — — 291,000 291,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 413,313 429,018 415,438 437,456 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 389,000 420,898 391,000 422,280 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 664,875 715,406 668,250 712,355 2021 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 847,875 880,094 — — 2021 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 997,500 1,053,360 — — The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at September 12, 2021 or January 3, 2021 . 7.

Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, equipment and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2041. The components of operating and finance lease cost for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 and the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 12, September 6, September 12, September 6, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 10,451 $ 10,267 $ 31,201 $ 30,099 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 1,022 548 2,944 1,248 Interest on lease liabilities 1,050 794 2,798 2,066 Total finance lease cost $ 2,072 $ 1,342 $ 5,742 $ 3,314 Rent expense totaled $ 18.3 million and $ 54.4 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 , respectively. Rent expense totaled $ 17.4 million and $ 50.0 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rent expense for short-term leases were immaterial for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s finance leases as of September 12, 2021 and January 3, 2021 was as follows: September 12, January 3, 2021 2021 Land and buildings $ 74,085 $ 68,084 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 12,991 ) ( 10,049 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 61,094 $ 58,035 Current portion of long-term debt $ 3,346 $ 2,855 Long-term debt, less current portion 61,180 57,700 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 64,526 $ 60,555 As of September 12, 2021 and January 3, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: September 12, 2021 January 3, 2021 Operating Finance Operating Finance Leases Leases Leases Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 15 years 7 years 16 years Weighted average discount rate 3.7 % 6.5 % 3.7 % 6.8 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 and the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 12, September 6, September 12, September 6, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 10,236 $ 9,288 $ 29,528 $ 29,455 Operating cash flows from finance leases 1,050 794 2,798 2,066 Financing cash flows from finance leases 771 348 2,068 1,388 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 7,785 10,719 19,138 26,297 Finance leases 390 1,717 6,050 20,463 13 Maturities of lease liabilities as of September 12, 2021 were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases 2021 $ 16,203 $ 2,394 2022 44,458 7,197 2023 39,019 6,759 2024 37,769 7,216 2025 31,375 7,018 Thereafter 92,261 74,509 Total future minimum rental commitments 261,085 105,093 Less – amounts representing interest ( 30,968 ) ( 40,567 ) Total lease liabilities $ 230,117 $ 64,526 As of September 12, 2021 , the Company has additional leases for one supply chain center and certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 66.6 million.

The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $ 10.3 million and $ 12.6 million as of September 12, 2021 and January 3, 2021 , respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 9. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 4.0 million at September 12, 2021 and $ 4.3 million at January 3, 2021 . The Company also had less than $ 0.1 million of non-cash investing activities related to lease incentives in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. 10. Equity Incentive Plans The Company’s current equity incentive plan, named the Domino’s Pizza, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Equity Incentive Plan”), benefits certain of the Company’s employees and members of the Company’s Board of Directors. In the three fiscal quarters of 2021, the Company granted non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units to certain employees and members of its Board of Directors under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. As a result of the changes to the characteristics and types of awards granted to date in 2021 under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company has included disclosure of the nature and terms of these awards granted in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, as well as the methods used to estimate their fair values below. The cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is amortized over the requisite service period of each award. All non-cash compensation expense amounts are recorded in general and administrative expense. Stock Options Stock options granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of the grant, expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. Additionally, all stock options granted become fully exercisable upon vesting. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Management estimated the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The expected life is based on several factors, including, among other things, the vesting term and contractual term as well as historical experience. The expected volatility is based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 14 Other Equity-Based Compensation Arrangements Restricted stock awards granted to members of the Company’s Board of Directors in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and vest one year from the date of grant, generally subject to the director’s continued service. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. These restricted stock units are separated into two or three tranches and have time-based ratable vesting conditions with the last tranche of the award vesting three years from the grant date, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. These awards generally also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date, adjusted for the estimated fair value of the market condition included in the award. These performance-based restricted stock units may vest three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment, and have time and performance-based vesting conditions which provide for potential payouts of the target award amount between zero percent and two hundred percent, based on the Company’s three-year cumulative achievement as compared to the specified target performance conditions. The performance-based restricted stock units also include provisions for a potential modifier (upward or downward) based on the Company’s cumulative three-year common stock performance relative to that of a pre-established peer group. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting of the time-based vesting condition upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Management estimated the fair value of each performance-based restricted stock unit using a Monte-Carlo simulation pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The Monte-Carlo simulation also includes assumptions for expected volatility based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price, as well as the correlation of the Company’s share price as compared to that of the pre-established peer group. 11. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”) , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2021, and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company’s 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. If the Company further needs to renegotiate its loan documents, the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 may currently be adopted and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 15 Ite m 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2021 and 2020 third quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended September 12, 2021 and September 6, 2020, respectively. The 2021 and 2020 three fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the thirty-six-week periods ended September 12, 2021 and September 6, 2020, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to the respective periods of 2020. Description of the Business Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout, and more than 18,300 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of September 12, 2021. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large worldwide network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. These factors emphasize our focus on our stakeholders, including our customers, team members, franchisees, communities and shareholders. Third Quarter of 2021 Highlights Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Highlights 16 Overview Domino's experienced global retail sales growth during both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. We continued our strong international same store sales performance with 111 straight quarters of positive international same store sales. Although U.S. same store sales were positive for the three fiscal quarters of 2021, U.S. same store sales declined 1.9% in the third quarter of 2021, rolling over an increase in U.S. same store sales of 17.5% in the third quarter of 2020. This decrease in U.S. same store sales was attributable in part to labor shortages affecting store hours and staffing levels in many of our markets, as well as a waning in the level of economic stimulus activity in the U.S in the third quarter of 2021. Same store sales in the U.S. continue to be positively affected by changes in consumer ordering behavior observed since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Internationally, we continued to experience sustained increases in retail sales during the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 resulting from evolving consumer trends, as well as the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of the second and third quarters of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our U.S. and international same store sales results continue to be pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 323 net stores in the third quarter of 2021, bringing our year-to-date total to 736 net store openings. We had 45 net stores open in the U.S. and 278 net stores open internationally during the third quarter of 2021. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our sales growth, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. stores +1.1% +21.3% +7.6% +15.3% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +16.5% +8.5% +19.2% +4.0% Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +8.5% +14.8% +13.1% +9.6% Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores (8.9)% +16.6% (2.0)% +12.4% U.S. franchise stores (1.5)% +17.5% +5.1% +11.6% U.S. stores (1.9)% +17.5% +4.6% +11.7% International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +8.8% +6.2% +11.4% +3.0% 17 Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 18 U.S. Stores Revenues Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 108.4 32.0 % $ 113.3 33.4 % $ 337.7 32.3 % $ 329.8 33.8 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 121.6 35.9 % 118.1 34.8 % 372.9 35.6 % 335.9 34.5 % U.S. franchise advertising 108.6 32.1 % 108.1 31.8 % 336.3 32.1 % 309.4 31.7 % U.S. stores $ 338.6 100.0 % $ 339.5 100.0 % $ 1,047.0 100.0 % $ 975.1 100.0 % U.S. Company-owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $4.8 million, or 4.3%, in the third quarter of 2021 due to a decrease in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $7.9 million, or 2.4%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 due to an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period resulting from net store growth, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. Company-owned same store sales. U.S. Company-owned same store sales decreased 8.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and decreased 2.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 16.6% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 12.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $3.6 million, or 3.0%, in the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. The decrease in U.S. franchise same store sales partially offset the increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fee revenues. Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $37.0 million, or 11.0%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period resulting from net store growth. U.S. franchise royalties were also negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 as a result of funding we provided to our franchisees as part of an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities. U.S. franchise royalties and fees further benefited in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. franchise same store sales decreased 1.5% in the third quarter of 2021 and increased 5.1% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 17.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 11.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $0.4 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2021 due primarily to an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in U.S. franchise same store sales as well as approximately $2.8 million in advertising incentives related to the Domino’s Surprise Frees TM promotion. Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $26.9 million, or 8.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. These increases were partially offset by the advertising incentives referenced above. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $15.2 million, or 2.6%, in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to higher market basket pricing to stores and higher revenues from sales of equipment to U.S. franchised stores. Supply chain revenues increased $134.6 million, or 8.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders and higher market basket pricing to stores. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.1% during the third quarter of 2021, which resulted in an estimated $6.3 million increase in supply chain revenues. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.6% during the three fiscal quarters of 2021, which resulted in an estimated $38.0 million increase in supply chain revenues. 19 International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $16.0 million, or 29.2%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $46.9 million, or 29.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 due primarily to higher retail sales resulting from same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. These increases in retail sales were benefited by the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of the Company’s international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of the second and third quarters of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.3 million and $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2021 and three fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively, also contributed to the increases in international franchise royalties and fees revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 8.8% in the third quarter of 2021, and increased 11.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020, and increased 3.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Consolidated revenues $ 998.0 100.0 % $ 967.7 100.0 % $ 3,014.2 100.0 % $ 2,760.8 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 612.8 61.4 % 605.7 62.6 % 1,832.1 60.8 % 1,701.6 61.6 % Consolidated operating margin $ 385.2 38.6 % $ 362.0 37.4 % $ 1,182.0 39.2 % $ 1,059.2 38.4 % Consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $23.2 million, or 6.4%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $122.8 million, or 11.6%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 1.2 percentage points in the third quarter of 2021 and increased 0.8 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin remained consistent in the third quarter of 2021 and increased 1.0 percentage point in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. Supply chain operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2021 and decreased 0.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. These changes in operating margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Operating Margin Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Revenues $ 108.4 100.0 % $ 113.3 100.0 % $ 337.7 100.0 % $ 329.8 100.0 % Cost of sales 86.9 80.2 % 90.8 80.2 % 260.7 77.2 % 258.0 78.2 % Store operating margin $ 21.5 19.8 % $ 22.5 19.8 % $ 77.0 22.8 % $ 71.8 21.8 % U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $1.0 million, or 4.4%, in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower same store sales, partially offset by lower labor costs. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased $5.2 million, or 7.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to lower labor costs and higher retail sales due to net store growth, but these increases were partially offset by lower same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store operating margin remained consistent in the third quarter of 2021 and increased 1.0 percentage point in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in additional detail below. 20 Supply Chain Operating Margin Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Revenues $ 588.8 100.0 % $ 573.7 100.0 % $ 1,760.1 100.0 % $ 1,625.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 525.9 89.3 % 515.0 89.8 % 1,571.4 89.3 % 1,443.6 88.8 % Supply chain operating margin $ 62.9 10.7 % $ 58.7 10.2 % $ 188.7 10.7 % $ 181.9 11.2 % Supply chain operating margin increased $4.2 million, or 7.2%, in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher equipment revenues as well as lower supply cost. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2021. While the market basket pricing to stores increased 2.1% during the third quarter of 2021, we incurred additional supply costs during the third quarter of 2020 as a result of certain expenses related to the provision of safety and cleaning equipment in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher labor cost as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter of 2021 partially offset the effect of the lower supply costs. Supply chain operating margin increased $6.8 million, or 3.6%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to higher equipment revenues as well as lower supply cost and higher volumes from increased store orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 primarily due to higher food and labor cost. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $4.7 million, or 5.1%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $19.8 million, or 7.4%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, driven primarily by higher labor costs, including non-cash equity-based compensation expense as well as higher travel expense. The increases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by lower professional fees in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $0.4 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $26.9 million, or 8.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income Other income was $2.5 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, representing the unrealized gain recorded on the Company’s investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional $40.0 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $7.1 million, or 18.4%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $14.7 million, or 12.6%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. These increases were driven by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”). In connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, we recorded $2.3 million of incremental interest expense in the second quarter of 2021, primarily representing the expense for $2.0 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes, and $0.3 million of additional interest expense incurred on the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes, resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes and the 2021 Notes (as defined in the ""2021 Recapitalization"" section below) for a short period of time. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.8% in the third quarter of 2021 from 3.9% in the third quarter of 2020, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding due to the 2021 Recapitalization. The Company's weighted average borrowing rate was 3.9% in the three fiscal quarters of both 2021 and 2020. 21 Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense decreased $10.2 million, or 41.6%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $48.6 million, or 185.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due to changes in excess tax benefits on non-cash equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, as well as higher pre-tax income in the respective periods of 2021. The Company recognized $14.0 million in excess tax benefits in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2020, and $18.3 million in excess tax benefits in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to $56.9 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These changes in excess tax benefits from non-cash equity-based compensation resulted primarily from the timing of stock options exercised in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020. The effective tax rate decreased to 10.7% during the third quarter of 2021 as compared to 19.9% in the third quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate increased to 17.4% during the three fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to 7.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to a reportable segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Third Quarter of 2021 Third Quarter of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Stores $ 102.0 $ 101.5 $ 321.3 $ 292.7 Supply Chain 53.6 51.1 164.7 159.5 International Franchise 57.3 44.5 168.1 124.4 Other (10.0 ) (13.7 ) (25.7 ) (34.4 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $0.5 million, or 0.4%, in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the $3.6 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, partially offset by the $1.0 million decrease in U.S. Company-owned store operating margin, as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income increased $28.5 million, or 9.7%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to the $37.0 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues and the $5.2 million increase in U.S. Company-owned store operating margin, as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. These increases in U.S. stores Segment Income were partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives for the respective periods. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $2.5 million, or 4.8%, in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to the $4.2 million increase in operating margin described above. Supply chain Segment Income increased $5.3 million, or 3.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to the $6.8 million increase in operating margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $12.9 million or 28.9%, in the third quarter of 2021, due primarily to the $16.0 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise Segment Income increased $43.8 million or 35.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to the $46.9 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. The increases in international franchise Segment Income were partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021. Other Other Segment Income increased $3.7 million, or 26.9%, in the third quarter of 2021, and increased $8.7 million, or 25.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2020, as well as lower professional fees. The increase in allocated costs in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our U.S. and international franchise stores. Higher labor and travel costs partially offset the increases in other Segment Income. 22 Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. As of September 12, 2021, we had working capital of $215.1 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $206.3 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $186.8 million and advertising fund liabilities of $178.5 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $295.4 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021, we experienced increases in international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. While our U.S. same store sales declined in the third quarter of 2021, same store sales increased during the three fiscal quarters of 2021. Additionally, both our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021. These factors contributed to our global retail sales growth realized in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2021 which resulted in our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. As of September 12, 2021, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of September 12, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.5 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.5 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of September 12, 2021, we had $158.6 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.5 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $206.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 12, 2021, we also held $166.7 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of September 12, 2021, we had approximately $5.07 billion of long-term debt, of which $54.8 million was classified as a current liability. As of September 12, 2021, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $12.9 million in the remainder of 2021, $51.5 million in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then-outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of our outstanding notes were classified as long-term debt in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x, and accordingly, resumed making the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our outstanding notes beginning in the second quarter of 2021. 23 2021 Recapitalization During the second quarter of 2021, on April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), we completed the 2021 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to our asset-backed securitization structure. The new notes consist of $850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”), and $1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of September 12, 2021, the 2021 Notes had scheduled principal payments of $4.6 million in 2021, $18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027, $804.8 million in 2028, $10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of our subsidiaries also issued the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, which allow for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, our previous variable funding note facility was canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $291.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $582.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year fixed rate notes. The proceeds were also used to pre-fund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment of the 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, we expensed approximately $2.0 million for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Additionally, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, we capitalized $14.9 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into interest expense over the 7.5 and 10-year expected terms of the 2021 Notes. We used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which primarily included a $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with a counterparty. The ASR Agreement is described in additional detail below. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased and retired 65,870 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $25.0 million. Our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock on February 24, 2021. On April 30, 2021, we entered into the ASR Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization to pay the counterparty $1.0 billion in cash and received and retired 2,012,596 shares of our common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, we received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of our common stock at an average price of $444.29, including the 2,012,596 shares of our common stock received and retired during the second quarter of 2021. On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This repurchase program replaced our previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was fully utilized in connection with the ASR Agreement. During the third quarter of 2021, we repurchased and retired 152,817 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $79.7 million. During the three fiscal quarters of 2021, we repurchased and retired 2,469,473 shares of our common stock (including 2,250,786 shares of common stock repurchased under the ASR Agreement and 218,687 shares of common stock repurchased under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program) for a total of approximately $1.1 billion. As of September 12, 2021, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $920.3 million. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter and through October 12, 2021, we repurchased and retired an additional 205,145 shares of common stock for a total of approximately $100.1 million. Dividends On July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2021, which was paid on September 30, 2021. We had approximately $35.1 million accrued for common stock dividends at September 12, 2021. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, on October 12, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2021, to be paid on December 30, 2021. 24 Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Cash flows provided by (used in) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 484.6 $ 370.4 Net cash used in investing activities (90.3 ) (91.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (228.1 ) (153.6 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 0.1 0.2 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 166.2 $ 126.0 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $114.2 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $73.0 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities, income tax payments as well as the timing of collections on accounts receivable in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in net income, adjusted for the impact of non-cash transactions, of $24.5 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021 also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $16.7 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the receipt of advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $90.3 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, which primarily consisted of $50.7 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations) and an additional investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) of $40.0 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $228.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $1.1 billion in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program (including $1.0 billion under the ASR Agreement), repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $896.2 million, dividend payments of $71.2 million, cash paid for financing costs as part of the 2021 Recapitalization of $14.9 million and tax payments for the vesting of restricted stock of $6.8 million. Of the total amount of repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, $873.0 million represents the repayment of the remaining principal under our then-outstanding 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes as part of the 2021 Recapitalization. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from our 2021 Recapitalization of $1.85 billion and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $15.9 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2020 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be revenue recognition, long-lived assets, insurance and legal matters, share-based payments and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since January 3, 2021. 25 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at September 12, 2021, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of September 12, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 7.1% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2021, approximately 6.9% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2021, approximately 5.6% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2020 and approximately 5.8% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $18.4 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2021. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (who is also serving as the Company’s interim principal financial officer), Richard E. Allison, Jr., performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended September 12, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 27 PA RT II. OTHER INFORMATION Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The total number of shares purchased in Period 8, 2021 (July 19, 2021 to August 15, 2021) includes 238,190 shares received at final settlement of the ASR Agreement. In connection with the ASR Agreement, the Company received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of its common stock at an average price of $444.29. On July 20, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. As of September 12, 2021, $920.3 million remained available for future purchases of the Company’s common stock under this share repurchase program. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter and through October 12, 2021, the Company repurchased and retired an additional 205,145 shares of common stock for a total of approximately $100.1 million, or an average price of $487.90 per share. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

Recapitalization On April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), the Company completed a recapitalization transaction (the “2021 Recapitalization”) in which certain of the Company’s subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The new notes consist of $ 850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”) and $ 1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of June 20, 2021, the 2021 Notes had scheduled principal payments of $ 9.3 million in 2021, $ 18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027, $ 804.8 million in 2028, $ 10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $ 905.0 million in 2031. Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $ 1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $ 200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, the Company’s previous $ 200.0 million variable funding note facility was canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $ 291.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $ 582.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, prefund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment of the 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, the Company expensed approximately $ 2.0 million for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Additionally, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company capitalized $ 14.9 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into interest expense over the 7.5 and 10-year expected terms of the 2021 Notes. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0 x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment for its then-outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of the Company’s outstanding notes were classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0 x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its notes in the second quarter of 2021. On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into the $ 1.0 billion ASR Agreement . Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization to pay the counterparty $ 1.0 billion in cash and received and retired 2,012,596 shares of its common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, the Company received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of its common stock at an average price of $ 444.29 , including the 2,012,596 shares of its common stock received and retired during the second quarter of 2021. 6. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. 10 Table of Contents The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at June 20, 2021 and January 3, 2021: At June 20, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 261,183 $ 261,183 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 117,783 117,783 — — Investments in marketable securities 14,195 14,195 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 129,810 129,810 — — Investments 82,500 — — 82,500 At January 3, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 151,502 $ 151,502 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,595 126,595 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,251 13,251 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 104,197 104,197 — — Investments 40,000 — — 40,000 During the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands Ltd., a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Dash Brands”), for $ 40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in Dash Brands’ senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company invested an additional $ 40.0 million in Dash Brands based on Dash Brands’ achievement of certain pre-established performance conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a positive adjustment of $ 2.5 million to the original carrying amount of $ 40.0 million resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This amount was recorded in other income in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 82.5 million in the second quarter of 2021. The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Dash Brands from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at June 20, 2021. Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, Unrealized June 20, 2021 Purchases Gain 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated below. 11 Table of Contents Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes, the 2019 fixed rate notes and the 2021 fixed rate notes as follows: June 20, 2021 January 3, 2021 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 764,000 $ 802,200 $ 766,000 $ 809,662 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes — — 582,000 582,582 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 967,500 1,032,323 970,000 1,035,960 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes — — 291,000 291,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 414,375 433,022 415,438 437,456 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 390,000 422,370 391,000 422,280 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 666,563 715,222 668,250 712,355 2021 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 850,000 872,950 — — 2021 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 1,000,000 1,042,000 — — The Company’s variable funding notes are a variable rate loan, and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at June 20, 2021 or January 3, 2021. 7.

Rent expense totaled $ 16.2 million and $ 32.6 million in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rent expense for short-term leases were immaterial for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 and 2020, respectively. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s finance leases as of June 20, 2021 and January 3, 2021 was as follows: June 20, 2021 January 3, 2021 Land and buildings $ 73,822 $ 68,084 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 11,979 ) ( 10,049 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 61,843 $ 58,035 Current portion of long-term debt $ 3,269 $ 2,855 Long-term debt, less current portion 61,697 57,700 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 64,966 $ 60,555 As of June 20, 2021 and January 3, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: June 20, 2021 January 3, 2021 Operating Leases Finance Leases Operating Leases Finance Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 15 years 7 years 16 years Weighted average discount rate 3.7 % 6.5 % 3.7 % 6.8 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 and the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Two Fiscal Quarters Ended June 20, 2021 June 14, 2020 June 20, 2021 June 14, 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 9,105 $ 10,048 $ 19,292 $ 20,167 Operating cash flows from finance leases 722 897 1,748 1,272 Financing cash flows from finance leases 593 691 1,297 1,040 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 6,681 6,596 11,353 15,578 Finance leases 5,261 18,746 5,660 18,746 13 Table of Contents Maturities of lease liabilities as of June 20, 2021 were as follows: Operating Leases Finance Leases 2021 $ 26,194 $ 3,996 2022 43,813 7,202 2023 38,220 6,722 2024 36,928 7,181 2025 30,470 6,983 Thereafter 89,142 74,290 Total future minimum rental commitments 264,767 106,374 Less – amounts representing interest ( 32,299 ) ( 41,408 ) Total lease liabilities $ 232,468 $ 64,966 As of June 20, 2021, the Company has additional leases for one supply chain center and certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 51.1 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2021 and 2022 with lease terms of up to 16 years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above. The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $ 11.1 million and $ 12.6 million as of June 20, 2021 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 9. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 4.6 million at June 20, 2021 and $ 4.3 million at January 3, 2021. The Company also had less than $ 0.1 million of non-cash investing activities related to lease incentives in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. 10. Equity Incentive Plans The Company’s current equity incentive plan, named the Domino’s Pizza, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2004 Equity Incentive Plan”), benefits certain of the Company’s employees and members of the Company’s Board of Directors. In the two fiscal quarters of 2021, the Company granted non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units to certain employees and members of its Board of Directors under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan. As a result of the changes to the characteristics and types of awards granted to date in 2021 under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company has included disclosure of the nature and terms of these awards granted in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, as well as the methods used to estimate their fair values below. The cost of all employee stock options, as well as other equity-based compensation arrangements, is reflected in the condensed consolidated statements of income based on the estimated fair value of the awards and is amortized over the requisite service period of each award. All non-cash compensation expense amounts are recorded in general and administrative expense. Stock Options Stock options granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of the grant, expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. Additionally, all stock options granted become fully exercisable upon vesting. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Management estimated the fair value of each option grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The expected life is based on several factors, including, among other things, the vesting term and contractual term as well as historical experience. The expected volatility is based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price. 14 Table of Contents Other Equity-Based Compensation Arrangements Restricted stock awards granted to members of the Company’s Board of Directors in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date and vest one year from the date of grant, generally subject to the director’s continued service. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date. These restricted stock units are separated into three tranches and have time-based ratable vesting conditions with the last tranche of the award vesting three years from the grant date, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements . Performance-based restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2021 were granted with a fair value equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the grant date, adjusted for the estimated fair value of the market condition included in the award. These performance-based restricted stock units may vest three years from the date of grant, generally subject to the holder’s continued employment, and have time and performance-based vesting conditions which provide for potential payouts of the target award amount between zero percent and two hundred percent, based on the Company’s three-year cumulative achievement as compared to the specified target performance conditions. The performance-based restricted stock units also include provisions for a potential modifier (upward or downward) based on the Company’s cumulative three-year common stock performance relative to that of a pre-established peer group. These awards also contain provisions for accelerated vesting of the time-based vesting condition upon the retirement eligibility of holders that have achieved specified service and age requirements. Management estimated the fair value of each performance-based restricted stock unit using a Monte-Carlo simulation pricing method. The risk-free interest rate is based on the estimated expected life and is estimated based on U.S. Treasury Bond rates as of the grant date. The Monte-Carlo simulation also includes assumptions for expected volatility based principally on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price, as well as the correlation of the Company’s share price as compared to that of the pre-established peer group . 11. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”) , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2021, and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company’s 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. However, the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. If the Company further needs to renegotiate its loan documents, the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 is currently effective and upon adoption may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 15 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2021 and 2020 second quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended June 20, 2021 and June 14, 2020, respectively. The 2021 and 2020 two fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the twenty-four-week periods ended June 20, 2021 and June 14, 2020, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to the respective periods of 2020. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout, and more than 18,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of June 20, 2021. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large global network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. These factors emphasize our focus on our stakeholders, including our customers, team members, franchisees, communities and shareholders. Second Quarter of 2021 Highlights • Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores worldwide), increased 17.1% as compared to 2020. U.S. retail sales increased 7.4% and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 29.5% as compared to 2020. • Same store sales increased 3.5% in our U.S. stores and increased 13.9% in our international stores. • Revenues increased 12.2%. • Income from operations increased 16.7%. • Net income decreased 1.7%. • Diluted earnings per share increased 2.3%. Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Highlights • Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 15.6% as compared to 2020. U.S. retail sales increased 11.1% and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 20.6% as compared to 2020. • Same store sales increased 8.1% in our U.S. stores and increased 12.8% in our international stores. • Revenues increased 12.4%. • Income from operations increased 18.2%. • Net income decreased 2.5%. • Diluted earnings per share increased 0.2%. 16 Table of Contents During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, we experienced global retail sales growth and U.S. and international same store sales growth. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. We also continued our strong U.S. and international same store sales performance with 41 straight quarters of positive U.S. same store sales and 110 straight quarters of positive international same store sales. We continued to experience sustained increases in U.S. and international same store sales during the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 resulting from evolving consumer trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our U.S. supply chain experienced higher volumes from the increases in U.S. retail sales in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. Our international retail sales in the second quarter of 2021 were also benefited by the reopening and resumption of normal store hours at certain of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed for portions of the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth has been pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 238 net stores in the second quarter of 2021, bringing our year-to-date total to 413 net store openings. We had 35 net stores open in the U.S. and 203 net stores open internationally during the second quarter of 2021. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our sales growth, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. stores +7.4 % +19.9 % +11.1 % +12.4 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +29.5 % (3.4 )% +20.6 % +1.8 % Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +17.1 % +8.1 % +15.6 % +7.0 % Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in international local currency sales. Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores (2.6 )% +16.9 % +1.6 % +10.4 % U.S. franchise stores +3.9 % +16.0 % +8.5 % +8.7 % U.S. stores +3.5 % +16.1 % +8.1 % +8.8 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +13.9 % +1.3 % +12.8 % +1.4 % 17 Table of Contents Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 18 Table of Contents U.S. Stores Revenues Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 116.6 32.4 % $ 114.2 34.3 % $ 229.3 32.4 % $ 216.6 34.1 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 126.8 35.3 % 113.1 34.0 % 251.3 35.5 % 217.8 34.2 % U.S. franchise advertising 116.3 32.3 % 105.4 31.7 % 227.7 32.1 % 201.3 31.7 % U.S. stores $ 359.8 100.0 % $ 332.8 100.0 % $ 708.4 100.0 % $ 635.7 100.0 % U.S. Company-Owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $2.4 million, or 2.1%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $12.7 million, or 5.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Same store sales growth in the two fiscal quarters of 2021 also benefited U.S. Company-owned stores revenues. The decrease in U.S. Company-owned same store sales in the second quarter of 2021 partially offset the increase in U.S. Company-owned stores revenues. U.S. Company-owned same store sales decreased 2.6% in the second quarter of 2021 and increased 1.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Company-owned same store sales increased 16.9% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 10.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $13.7 million, or 12.1%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $33.5 million, or 15.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. U.S. franchise royalties were also negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020 as a result of funding we provided to our franchisees as part of an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities. U.S. franchise royalties and fees further benefited in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2021 from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.9% in the second quarter of 2021 and increased 8.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 16.0% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 8.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $10.9 million, or 10.3%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $26.4 million, or 13.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $63.9 million, or 11.8%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $119.5 million, or 11.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from U.S. franchise retail sales growth. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 5.5% during the second quarter of 2021, which resulted in an estimated $29.7 million increase in supply chain revenues. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.9% during the two fiscal quarters of 2021, which resulted in an estimated $31.7 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $21.6 million, or 45.0%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $30.9 million, or 29.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021 due primarily to higher retail sales resulting from same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. These increases in retail sales were also benefited by the reopening and resumption of normal store hours and operating procedures at certain of the Company’s international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed or affected by changes in operating procedures and store hours for portions of the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $4.0 million and $6.1 million in the second quarter of 2021 and two fiscal quarters of 2021, respectively, also contributed to the increases in international franchise royalties and fees revenues. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 13.9% in the second quarter of 2021 and increased 12.8% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.3% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 1.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. 19 Table of Contents Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Consolidated revenues $ 1,032.5 100.0 % $ 920.0 100.0 % $ 2,016.2 100.0 % $ 1,793.1 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 624.8 60.5 % 562.9 61.2 % 1,219.3 60.5 % 1,095.9 61.1 % Consolidated operating margin $ 407.7 39.5 % $ 357.1 38.8 % $ 796.8 39.5 % $ 697.2 38.9 % Consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $50.6 million, or 14.2%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $99.6 million, or 14.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 0.7 percentage points in the second quarter of 2021 and increased 0.6 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased 1.4 percentage points in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2021. Supply chain operating margin decreased 0.9 percentage points in the second quarter of 2021 and decreased 1.0 percentage point in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. These changes in margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Revenues $ 116.6 100.0 % $ 114.2 100.0 % $ 229.3 100.0 % $ 216.6 100.0 % Cost of sales 88.0 75.5 % 87.8 76.9 % 173.8 75.8 % 167.2 77.2 % Store operating margin $ 28.6 24.5 % $ 26.4 23.1 % $ 55.6 24.2 % $ 49.3 22.8 % U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) increased $2.2 million, or 8.2%, in the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to lower labor costs. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased $6.3 million, or 12.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher same store sales and lower labor costs. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased 1.4 percentage points in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below. • Food costs increased 1.8 percentage points to 27.5% in the second quarter of 2021, due to higher food prices. Food costs increased 0.6 percentage points to 27.3% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due to higher food prices, partially offset by the leveraging of higher same store sales. • Labor costs decreased 4.5 percentage points to 27.4% in the second quarter of 2021, and decreased 2.6 percentage points to 27.9% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to additional bonus pay incurred during the second quarter of 2020 for frontline team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. • Insurance costs increased 0.6 percentage points to 3.9% in the second quarter of 2021, and increased 0.3 percentage points to 3.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. • Occupancy costs increased 0.5 percentage points to 7.4% in the second quarter of 2021, and increased 0.3 percentage points to 7.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher rent expense. Supply Chain Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Revenues $ 603.0 100.0 % $ 539.1 100.0 % $ 1,171.3 100.0 % $ 1,051.8 100.0 % Cost of sales 536.8 89.0 % 475.1 88.1 % 1,045.6 89.3 % 928.7 88.3 % Supply chain operating margin $ 66.2 11.0 % $ 64.0 11.9 % $ 125.7 10.7 % $ 123.2 11.7 % Supply chain operating margin increased $2.2 million, or 3.4%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $2.5 million, or 2.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased store orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.9 percentage points in the second quarter of 2021, and decreased 1.0 percentage point in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to higher insurance, food and delivery costs, as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the new supply chain facilities that were opened in fiscal 2020. These decreases in the supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues were partially offset by lower labor costs in the second quarter of 2021 as a result of higher sales leverage. 20 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $12.3 million, or 14.1%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $15.1 million, or 8.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, driven primarily by higher labor costs, including variable performance-based compensation and non-cash equity-based compensation expense. These increases were partially offset by lower professional fees in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $10.9 million, or 10.3%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $26.4 million, or 13.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income Other income was $2.5 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, representing the unrealized gain recorded on the Company’s investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional $40.0 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $6.7 million, or 17.2%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $7.6 million, or 9.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. These increases were driven by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 16, 2021 (the “2021 Recapitalization”), offset in part by a lower weighted average borrowing rate in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. In connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, we recorded approximately $2.3 million of incremental interest expense in the second quarter of 2021, primarily representing the expense for approximately $2.0 million of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes, and approximately $0.3 million of additional interest expense incurred on the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes, resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2017 five-year fixed rate notes and 2017 five-year floating rate notes and the 2021 Notes (as defined below) for a short period of time. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.8% in both the second quarter of 2021 and two fiscal quarters of 2021 from 3.9% in both the second quarter of 2020 and two fiscal quarters of 2020, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding due to the 2021 Recapitalization. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense increased $22.7 million, or 388.6%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $58.9 million, or 3,865.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, as well as higher pre-tax income. The Company recognized $3.4 million in excess tax benefits in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $23.0 million in the second quarter of 2020, and $4.3 million in excess tax benefits in the two fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to $53.4 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These decreases in excess tax benefits resulted from a significant decrease in stock options exercised in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020. The effective tax rate increased to 19.6% during the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 4.7% in the second quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate increased to 20.5% during the two fiscal quarters of 2021 as compared to 0.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. 21 Table of Contents Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to an operating segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. Second Quarter of 2021 Second Quarter of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 U.S. Stores $ 111.8 $ 102.9 $ 219.3 $ 191.2 Supply Chain 58.6 56.9 111.1 108.3 International Franchise 56.4 36.4 110.8 79.9 Other (9.6 ) (12.6 ) (15.7 ) (20.7 ) U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $8.9 million, or 8.7%, in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the $13.7 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues, as discussed above. U.S. stores Segment Income increased $28.1 million, or 14.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to the $33.5 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. The $2.2 million and $6.3 million increases in U.S. Company-owned store operating margins in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 discussed above also contributed to the increases in U.S. stores Segment Income for the respective periods. These increases in U.S. stores Segment Income were partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives for the respective periods. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $1.7 million, or 3.0%, in the second quarter of 2021, primarily due to the $2.2 million increase in operating margin described above. Supply chain Segment Income increased $2.8 million, or 2.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily due to the $2.5 million increase in operating margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $20.0 million or 54.8%, in the second quarter of 2021, due primarily to the $21.6 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. The increase in international franchise Segment Income was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives in the second quarter of 2021. International franchise Segment Income increased $30.9 million, or 38.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to the $30.9 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income increased $3.0 million, or 23.3%, in the second quarter of 2021, and increased $5.0 million, or 24.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, due primarily to higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2020, as well as lower professional fees. The increase in allocated costs in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our U.S. and international franchise stores. Higher labor costs, including variable performance-based compensation expense, partially offset the increases in other Segment Income. 22 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. As of June 20, 2021, we had working capital of $234.2 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $184.7 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $165.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of $157.5 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $292.1 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2021. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. As of June 20, 2021, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of June 20, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.5 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.5 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of June 20, 2021, we had approximately $136.9 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $47.5 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.3 million of other restricted cash for a total of $184.7 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of June 20, 2021, we also held $147.0 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of June 20, 2021, we had approximately $5.08 billion of long-term debt, of which $54.8 million was classified as a current liability. As of June 20, 2021, our fixed rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2021, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $25.8 million in the remainder of 2021, $51.5 million in each of 2022, 2023 and 2024, $1.17 billion in 2025, $39.3 million in 2026, $1.31 billion in 2027, $811.5 million in 2028, $625.9 million in 2029, $10.0 million in 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. In accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then-outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of our outstanding notes were classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 3, 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x, and accordingly, resumed making the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our outstanding notes beginning in the second quarter of 2021. 23 Table of Contents 2021 Recapitalization During the second quarter of 2021, on April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), we completed the 2021 Recapitalization in which certain of our subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to our asset-backed securitization structure. The new notes consist of $850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”), and $1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of June 20, 2021, the 2021 Notes had scheduled principal payments of $9.3 million in 2021, $18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027, $804.8 million in 2028, $10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of our subsidiaries also issued the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, which allow for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit. The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, our previous variable funding note facility was canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $291.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $582.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year fixed rate notes. The proceeds were also used to pre-fund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment of the 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes, we expensed approximately $2.0 million for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Additionally, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, we capitalized $14.9 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into interest expense over the 7.5 and 10-year expected terms of the 2021 Notes. We used the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which primarily included a $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “ASR Agreement”) with a counterparty. The ASR Agreement is described in additional detail below. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased and retired 65,870 shares of our common stock in open market repurchases under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $25.0 million. Our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock on February 24, 2021. On April 30, 2021, we entered into the ASR Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, we used a portion of the proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization to pay the counterparty $1.0 billion in cash and received and retired 2,012,596 shares of our common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, we received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of our common stock at an average price of $444.29, including the 2,012,596 shares of our common stock received and retired during the second quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, on July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. This repurchase program replaces our previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program, which was fully utilized in connection with the ASR Agreement. Dividends On April 27, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2021, which was paid on June 30, 2021. We had approximately $35.5 million accrued for common stock dividends at June 20, 2021. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, on July 20, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2021, to be paid on September 30, 2021. 24 Table of Contents Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Two Fiscal Quarters of 2021 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 295.4 $ 211.8 Net cash used in investing activities (72.9 ) (74.2 ) Net cash used in financing activities (101.2 ) (50.9 ) Exchange rate changes 0.3 (0.3 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 121.6 $ 86.4 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $83.6 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2021 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $51.5 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of collections on accounts receivable and payments for accrued liabilities in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $30.6 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the receipt of advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $72.9 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, which primarily consisted of an additional investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) of $40.0 million and $33.2 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate store operations). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $101.2 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $1.025 billion in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program (including $1.0 billion under the ASR Agreement), repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations of $882.5 million, dividend payments of $36.4 million and cash paid for financing costs as part of the 2021 Recapitalization of $14.9 million. Of the total amount of repayments of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, $873.0 million represents the repayment of the remaining principal under our then-outstanding 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five-year fixed rate notes as part of the 2021 Recapitalization. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from our 2021 Recapitalization of $1.85 billion and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9.0 million. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates For a description of the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to “Part II—Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2020 Form 10-K. The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be revenue recognition, long-lived assets, insurance and legal matters, share-based payments and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since January 3, 2021. 25 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at June 20, 2021, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of June 20, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our 2021 Variable Funding Notes. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Our 2021 Variable Funding Notes loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk, although we have not done so historically. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.7% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2021, approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2021, approximately 5.2% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2020 and approximately 5.9% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $12.1 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (who is also serving as the Company’s interim principal financial officer), Richard E. Allison, Jr., performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended June 20, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 27 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2020 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. c. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers.

During the second quarter, the shares were purchased at an average price of $412.96. (2) On February 24, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. On April 30, 2021, the Company entered into the ASR Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Agreement, on May 3, 2021, the Company received and retired 2,012,596 shares of its common stock. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on July 21, 2021. In connection with the ASR Agreement, the Company received and retired a total of 2,250,786 shares of its common stock at an average price of $444.29, including the 2,012,596 shares of its common stock received and retired during the second quarter of 2021. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, on July 20, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. This repurchase program replaces the Company’s previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program that was authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors on February 24, 2021 which was fully utilized in connection with the ASR Agreement. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future. (3) The average price paid per share of $434.73 for Period #5 (April 26, 2021 to May 23, 2021) excludes the average price paid per share for shares purchased under the ASR Agreement. Because the total number of shares ultimately delivered was not determined until the end of the applicable purchase period in the third quarter of 2021, the average purchase price per share was not determinable until July 21, 2021, subsequent to the end of the second quarter. 28 Table of Contents Item 3.

Recapitalization Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2021, on April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), the Company completed a recapitalization (the “2021 Recapitalization”) in which certain of the Company’s subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to an asset-backed securitization. The new notes consist of $ 850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “ 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”), and $ 1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151 % Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (the “ 2021 A-2-II Fixed Rate Notes” and, collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “ 2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended. The 2021 Notes have scheduled principal payments of $ 9.3 million in 2021 , $ 18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027 , $ 804.8 million in 2028 , $ 10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $ 905.0 million in 2031 . Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $ 1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries also issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $ 200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Variable Funding Notes, the Company’s previous $ 200.0 million variable funding note facility was canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $ 291.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $ 582.0 million in outstanding principal under the Company’s 2017 five -year fixed rate notes, prefund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. In connection with the repayment of the 2017 five-year floating rate notes and 2017 five -year fixed rate notes, the Company expensed approximately $ 2.0 million for the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with these notes. Additionally, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company capitalized $ 14.9 million of debt issuance costs, which are being amortized into interest expense over the 7.5 and 10-year expected terms of the 2021 Notes. As of the first quarter of 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 , the Company had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0 x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment for its then outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of the Company’s outstanding notes have been classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0 x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its notes in the second quarter of 2021 . 6. Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. Fair Value of Cash Equivalents and Investments The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021: At March 28, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 194,325 $ 194,325 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 104,232 104,232 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,384 13,384 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 113,384 113,384 — — Investments 82,500 — — 82,500 9 At January 3, 2021 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 151,502 $ 151,502 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,595 126,595 — — Investments in marketable securities 13,251 13,251 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 104,197 104,197 — — Investments 40,000 — — 40,000 During the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands Ltd., a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Dash Brands”), for $ 40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. The Company’s investment in Dash Brands’ senior ordinary shares, which are not in-substance common stock, represents an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company invested an additional $ 40.0 million in Dash Brands based on Dash Brands’ achievement of certain preestablished performance conditions. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company recorded a positive adjustment of $ 2.5 million to the original carrying amount of $ 40.0 million resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This amount was recorded in other income in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. The following table summarizes the reconciliation of the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in Dash Brands from the opening balance at January 3, 2021 to the closing balance at March 28, 2021. First Quarter of 2021 Carrying Amount Carrying Amount January 3, 2021 Purchases Unrealized Gain March 28, 2021 Investments $ 40,000 $ 40,000 $ 2,500 $ 82,500 Fair Value of Debt The estimated fair values of the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes and the 2019 fixed rate notes as follows: March 28, 2021 January 3, 2021 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 766,000 $ 808,896 $ 766,000 $ 809,662 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 582,000 583,164 582,000 582,582 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 970,000 1,034,020 970,000 1,035,960 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 291,000 291,291 291,000 291,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 415,438 436,625 415,438 437,456 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 391,000 422,671 391,000 422,280 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 668,250 703,667 668,250 712,355 The Company’s variable funding notes are a variable rate loan, and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company did not have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at March 28, 2021 or January 3, 2021. 10 7. Revenue Disclosures Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees. Changes in deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees for the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 28, 2021 March 22, 2020 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at beginning of period $ 19,090 $ 20,463 Revenue recognized during the period ( 1,390 ) ( 1,417 ) New deferrals due to cash received and other 803 724 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at end of period $ 18,503 $ 19,770 Advertising Fund Assets As of March 28, 2021, advertising fund assets, restricted of $ 162.1 million consisted of $ 131.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 28.8 million of accounts receivable and $ 1.4 million of prepaid expenses.

As of January 3, 2021, advertising fund cash and cash equivalents included $ 6.5 million of cash contributed from U.S. Company-owned stores that had not yet been expended. 8. Leases The Company leases certai n retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles, equipment and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2041. The components of operating and finance lease cost for the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 28, 2021 March 22, 2020 Operating lease cost $ 10,424 $ 9,582 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 919 249 Interest on lease liabilities 1,026 375 Total finance lease cost $ 1,945 $ 624 Rent expense totaled $ 18.2 million and $ 16.4 million in the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020, respectively. Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rent expense for short-term leases were immaterial in both the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s finance leases as of March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021 was as follows: March 28, 2021 January 3, 2021 Land and buildings $ 68,489 $ 68,084 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 10,973 ) ( 10,049 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 57,516 $ 58,035 Current portion of long-term debt $ 2,931 $ 2,855 Long-term debt, less current portion 57,338 57,700 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 60,269 $ 60,555 11 As of March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: March 28, 2021 January 3, 2021 Operating Leases Finance Leases Operating Leases Finance Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 16 years 7 years 16 years Weighted average discount rate 3.7 % 6.8 % 3.7 % 6.8 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2020 was as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 28, 2021 March 22, 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 10,187 $ 10,119 Operating cash flows from finance leases 1,026 375 Financing cash flows from finance leases 704 349 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 4,672 8,982 Finance leases 399 — Maturities of lease liabilities as of March 28, 2021 were as follows: Operating Leases Finance Leases 2021 $ 34,764 $ 4,620 2022 43,209 6,754 2023 37,620 6,274 2024 36,260 6,732 2025 29,559 6,527 Thereafter 87,007 69,983 Total future minimum rental commitments 268,419 100,890 Less – amounts representing interest ( 33,721 ) ( 40,621 ) Total lease liabilities $ 234,698 $ 60,269 As of March 28, 2021, the Company has additional leases for certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 15.7 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2021 with lease terms of up to 9 years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above. The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $ 12.0 million and $ 12.6 million as of March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 9. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 3.1 million at March 28, 2021 and $ 4.3 million at January 3, 2021. 12 10. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU 2019-12”) , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2021, and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”) , which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, the Company’s 2021 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR and the associated loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. If the Company further needs to renegotiate its loan documents, the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020- 0 4 is currently effective and upon adoption may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 13 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2021 and 2020 first quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended March 28, 2021 and March 22, 2020, respectively. In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout, and more than 17,800 locations in over 90 markets around the world as of March 28, 2021. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. We are a highly recognized global brand, and we focus on serving neighborhoods locally through our large global network of franchise owners and U.S. Company-owned stores. We are primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Domino’s stores currently owned and operated by our independent franchisees. Franchising enables an individual to be his or her own employer and maintain control over all employment-related matters and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of the Domino’s global brand and operating system with limited capital investment by us. The Domino’s business model is straightforward: Domino’s stores handcraft and serve quality food at a competitive price, with easy ordering access and efficient service, enhanced by our technological innovations. Our hand-tossed dough is made fresh and distributed to stores around the world by us and our franchisees. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our franchisees. Royalties are ongoing percent-of-sales fees for use of the Domino’s ® brand marks. We also generate revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees through our supply chain operations, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of Company-owned stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they may profit by sub-franchising and selling food and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can purchase Domino’s menu items for themselves and their family conveniently and economically. The Domino’s business model can yield strong returns for our franchise owners and our Company-owned stores. It can also yield significant cash flows to us, through a consistent franchise royalty payment and supply chain revenue stream, with moderate capital expenditures. We have historically returned cash to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. These factors emphasize our focus on our stakeholders, including our customers, team members, franchisees, communities and shareholders. First Quarter of 2021 Highlights • Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact (which includes total retail sales at Company-owned and franchised stores worldwide) increased 14.0% as compared to 2020. U.S. retail sales increased 15.3% and international retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, increased 12.8% as compared to 2020. • Same store sales increased 13.4% in our U.S. stores and increased 11.8% in our international stores. • Revenues increased 12.7% • Income from operations increased 19.7%. • Net income decreased 3.2%. • Diluted earnings per share decreased 2.3%. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced global retail sales growth and U.S. and international same store sales growth. We believe our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. We also continued our strong U.S. and international same store sales performance with 40 straight quarters of positive U.S. same store sales and 109 straight quarters of positive international same store sales. Changes in consumer ordering behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in U.S. and international same store sales during the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, our U.S. supply chain experienced higher volumes from the increases in U.S. store sales. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth has been pressured by our fortressing strategy, which includes increasing store concentration in certain markets where we compete, as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 175 net stores in the first quarter of 2021. We had 36 net stores open in the U.S. and 139 net stores open internationally during the first quarter of 2021. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our sales growth, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. 14 Statistical Measures The tables below outline certain statistical measures we utilize to analyze our performance. This historical data is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. Global Retail Sales Growth (excluding foreign currency impact) Global retail sales growth (excluding foreign currency impact) is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Global retail sales growth refers to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. We believe global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and, in the U.S., advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. We review comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales in the U.S. and Canada. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to us by our franchisees and are not included in our revenues. Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 U.S. stores +15.3 % +4.9 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +12.8 % +6.8 % Total (excluding foreign currency impact) +14.0 % +5.9 % Same Store Sales Growth Same store sales growth is a commonly used statistical measure in the quick-service restaurant industry that is important to understanding performance. Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported on a constant dollar basis which reflects changes in international local currency sales. First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores +6.3 % +3.9 % U.S. franchise stores +13.9 % +1.5 % U.S. stores +13.4 % +1.6 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +11.8 % +1.5 % Store Growth Activity Store counts and net store growth are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding performance.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 112.7 32.3 % $ 102.3 33.8 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 124.5 35.7 % 104.7 34.6 % U.S. franchise advertising 111.4 32.0 % 95.8 31.6 % U.S. stores $ 348.6 100.0 % $ 302.9 100.0 % U.S. Company-Owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $10.4 million, or 10.2%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. Company-owned stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Company-owned same store sales increased 6.3% in the first quarter of 2021 and 3.9% in the first quarter of 2020. 16 U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $19.8 million, or 18.8%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 13.9% in the first quarter of 2021 and 1.5% in the first quarter of 2020. U.S. franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $15.6 million, or 16.2%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, resulting from net store growth. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $55.6 million, or 10.9%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from U.S. franchise retail sales growth. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 0.3% during the first quarter of 2021, which resulted in an estimated $2.0 million increase in supply chain revenue. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $9.3 million, or 16.1%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to same store sales growth and an increase in the average number of international franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 11.8% in the first quarter of 2021 and increased 1.5% in the first quarter of 2020. The positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.1 million also contributed to the increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues in the first quarter of 2021. Cost of Sales / Operating Margin First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 Consolidated revenues $ 983.7 100.0 % $ 873.1 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 594.5 60.4 % 532.9 61.0 % Consolidated operating margin $ 389.2 39.6 % $ 340.2 39.0 % Consolidated cost of sales consists primarily of U.S. Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $49.0 million, or 14.4%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021. U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021 and supply chain operating margin decreased 1.0 percentage point in the first quarter of 2021. These changes in margin are described below. U.S. Company-Owned Store Operating Margin First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 Revenues $ 112.7 100.0 % $ 102.3 100.0 % Cost of sales 85.7 76.1 % 79.4 77.6 % Store operating margin $ 27.0 23.9 % $ 22.9 22.4 % U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) increased $4.1 million, or 17.7%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to higher same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021, as discussed in more detail below. • Food costs decreased 0.7 percentage points to 27.1% in the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales. • Labor costs decreased 0.6 percentage points to 28.4% in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales. 17 Supply Chain Operating Margin First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 Revenues $ 568.3 100.0 % $ 512.7 100.0 % Cost of sales 508.8 89.5 % 453.6 88.5 % Supply chain operating margin $ 59.5 10.5 % $ 59.1 11.5 % Supply chain operating margin increased $0.4 million, or 0.7%, in the first quarter of 2021, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased store orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 1.0 percentage point in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher operating costs, including depreciation and amortization, labor and insurance expense as a result of the two new supply chain centers and new thin crust facility that were opened in fiscal 2020. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 3.1%, in the first quarter of 2021, driven primarily by higher advertising expense and labor costs. These increases were partially offset by lower travel expense resulting from travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $15.6 million, or 16.2%, in the first quarter of 2021, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Other Income Other income was $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2021, representing the unrealized gain recorded on the Company’s investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) resulting from the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional $40.0 million investment made in the first quarter of 2021. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $0.9 million, or 2.2%, in the first quarter of 2021 driven primarily by lower interest income. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% in the first quarter of 2021, from 4.0% in the first quarter of 2020. Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense increased $36.2 million, or 840.3%, in the first quarter of 2021 due primarily to lower excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, as well as higher pre-tax income. The Company recognized $0.9 million in excess tax benefits in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to $30.4 million in the first quarter of 2020, resulting from a significant decrease in stock options exercised in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The effective tax rate increased to 21.3% during the first quarter of 2021 as compared to negative 3.7% in the first quarter of 2020. Segment Income We evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and allocate resources to them based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, referred to as Segment Income. Segment Income for each of our reportable segments is summarized in the table below. Other Segment Income primarily includes corporate administrative costs that are not allocable to an operating segment, including labor, computer expenses, professional fees, travel and entertainment, rent, insurance and other corporate administrative costs. First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 U.S. Stores $ 107.4 $ 88.3 Supply Chain 52.6 51.4 International Franchise 54.5 43.5 Other (6.1 ) (8.1 ) 18 U.S. Stores U.S. stores Segment Income increased $19.2 million, or 21.7%, in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a $19.8 million increase in U.S. franchise royalties and fees revenues as discussed above. U.S. franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on U.S. stores Segment Income. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized and had no impact on U.S. stores Segment Income. The $4.1 million increase in U.S. Company-owned store operating margin discussed above also contributed to the increase in U.S. stores Segment Income. The increase in U.S. stores Segment Income was partially offset by increased investments in technological initiatives. Supply Chain Supply chain Segment Income increased $1.1 million, or 2.2%, in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the $0.4 million increase in operating margin described above. International Franchise International franchise Segment Income increased $11.0 million, or 25.2%, in the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to the $9.3 million increase in international franchise royalties and fees revenues discussed above. International franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on international franchise Segment Income. Lower bad debt expense and lower travel expenses, primarily due to travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, also contributed to the increase in international franchise Segment Income. Other Other Segment Income increased $2.0 million, or 25.1%, in the first quarter of 2021, due primarily to higher corporate administrative costs allocated to our segments as compared to 2020. The increase in allocated costs in the first quarter of 2021 was due primarily to higher investments in technological initiatives to support technology for our U.S. and international franchise stores. Lower travel expenses, primarily due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as lower professional fees, also contributed to the increase in other Segment Income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale and we generally experience multiple inventory turns per month. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. These factors, coupled with the use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock, reduce our working capital amounts. As of March 28, 2021, we had working capital of $240.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $176.0 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $162.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of $155.0 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $267.7 million. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first quarter of 2021, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts in the first quarter of 2021. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. As of March 28, 2021, we had a variable funding note facility which allowed for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2019-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2019 Variable Funding Notes”). The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and certain supply chain center leases. As of March 28, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings and $157.5 million of available borrowing capacity under our 2019 Variable Funding Notes, net of letters of credit issued of $42.5 million. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. 19 Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to service our debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our outstanding senior notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of March 28, 2021, we had approximately $136.1 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $39.6 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.3 million of other restricted cash for a total of $176.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of March 28, 2021, we also held $131.9 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. Long-Term Debt As of March 28, 2021, we had approximately $4.12 billion of long-term debt, of which $2.9 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 had original scheduled principal payments of $42.0 million in 2021, $897.0 million in 2022, $33.0 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.15 billion in 2025, $20.8 million in 2026, $1.28 billion in 2027, $6.8 million in 2028 and $614.3 million in 2029. However, in accordance with our debt agreements, the payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if our leverage ratio is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related agreements, and no catch-up provisions are applicable. As of the first quarter of 2021 and fourth quarter of 2020, we had a leverage ratio of less than 5.0x, and accordingly, did not make the previously scheduled debt amortization payment on our then outstanding notes beginning in the first quarter of 2021. Accordingly, all principal amounts of our outstanding notes have been classified as long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2021 and January 3, 2021. 2021 Recapitalization Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of 2021, on April 16, 2021 (the “closing date”), we completed a recapitalization (the “2021 Recapitalization”) in which certain of our subsidiaries issued new notes pursuant to our asset-backed securitization structure. The new notes consist of $850.0 million Series 2021-1 2.662% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I with an anticipated term of 7.5 years (the “2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes”), and $1.0 billion Series 2021-1 3.151% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II with an anticipated term of 10 years (the “2021 A-2-II Fixed Rate Notes” and, collectively with the 2021 A-2-I Fixed Rate Notes, the “2021 Notes”) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The 2021 Notes have scheduled principal payments of $9.3 million in 2021, $18.5 million in each of 2022 through 2027, $804.8 million in 2028, $10.0 million in each of 2029 and 2030 and $905.0 million in 2031. Gross proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Notes were $1.85 billion. Concurrently, certain of our subsidiaries also issued a new variable funding note facility which allows for advances of up to $200.0 million of Series 2021-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 Notes and certain other credit instruments, including letters of credit (the “2021 Variable Funding Notes”). The 2021 Variable Funding Notes were undrawn on the closing date. In connection with the issuance of our 2021 Variable Funding Notes, our 2019 Variable Funding Notes were canceled. A portion of proceeds from the 2021 Recapitalization was used to repay the remaining $291.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year floating rate notes and $582.0 million in outstanding principal under our 2017 five-year fixed rate notes. The proceeds were also used to pre-fund a portion of the interest payable on the 2021 Notes and pay transaction fees and expenses. We expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include distributions to holders of our common stock, other equivalent payments and/or stock repurchases. Subsequent to the closing of the 2021 Recapitalization, we had a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, we resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on our notes in the second quarter of 2021. 20 Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first quarter of 2021, we repurchased and retired 65,870 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $25.0 million. Our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock on February 24, 2021 which replaced the remaining availability of approximately $76.6 million under our previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program. As of March 28, 2021, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of $1.0 billion. Dividends On February 24, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of March 15, 2021, which was paid on March 30, 2021. We had approximately $37.1 million accrued for common stock dividends at March 28, 2021. Subsequent to the first quarter, on April 27, 2021, our Board of Directors declared a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend on our outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2021, to be paid on June 30, 2021. Sources and Uses of Cash The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) First Quarter of 2021 First Quarter of 2020 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 152.9 $ 95.4 Net cash used in investing activities (56.4 ) (17.9 ) Net cash used in financing activities (23.1 ) (82.1 ) Exchange rate changes 0.2 (1.0 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 73.5 $ (5.6 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $57.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $51.0 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of collections on accounts receivable in 2021 as compared to 2020, and to a lesser extent, the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was also due to a $10.9 million positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted, in 2021 as compared to 2020 due to the receipt of advertising contributions outpacing payments for advertising activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in net income of $3.8 million. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $56.4 million in the first quarter of 2021, which primarily consisted of an additional investment in Dash Brands (Note 6) of $40.0 million and $16.6 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, corporate store operations and supply chain centers). Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2021, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $25.0 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $1.0 million and repayments of finance lease obligations of $0.7 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.7 million.

The Company considers its most significant accounting policies and estimates to be revenue recognition, long-lived assets, insurance and legal matters, share-based payments and income taxes. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates since January 3, 2021. 21 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we have issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at March 28, 2021, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of March 28, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2023. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2021, in connection with the 2021 Recapitalization, our loan documents contemplate a transition from LIBOR to secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”) in the event that LIBOR ceases to exist. Because the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR, in such event, there can be no assurance that SOFR will perform the same way LIBOR would have at any given time or for any applicable period. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2021 and approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2020 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Stuart A. Levy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Levy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended March 28, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 23 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2020 Form 10-K. Item 2.

During the first quarter, the shares were purchased at an average price of $357.43. (2) On February 24, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock. This repurchase program replaced the remaining availability of approximately $76.6 million under the Company’s previously approved $1.0 billion share repurchase program. As of March 28, 2021, $1.0 billion remained available for future purchases of the Company’s common stock under the Company’s Board of Directors approved share repurchase program. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

tabular amounts in thousands, except percentages, share and per share amounts) September 6, 2020 1. Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended September 6, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending January 3, 2021. Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”) in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for the measurement of credit losses below. Refer to Note 10 for information related to the impact of the adoption of ASC 326 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Credit Losses The Company closely monitors accounts and notes receivable balances and estimates the allowance for credit losses. These estimates are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company’s allowances for accounts and notes receivable have not historically been material. The Company also monitors its off-balance sheet exposures under its letters of credit, surety bonds and lease guarantees. None of these arrangements has had or is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. During the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands Ltd., a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Dash Brands”), for $ 40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. As a result of the investment, the Company’s significant accounting policy related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values is stated below. Refer to Note 9 for information related to this investment and its impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments and are classified as long-term other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Any adjustments to the carrying amount are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of its investments based on various analyses including financial results and operating trends, implied values from recent similar transactions and other relevant available information. If the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the estimated fair value of the investment, an impairment loss is recognized, and the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. 7 Table of Contents 2.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment (Note 9) is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of certain assets at September 6, 2020 and December 29, 2019: At September 6, 2020 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 276,905 $ 276,905 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 102,763 102,763 — — Investments in marketable securities 12,043 12,043 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 97,190 97,190 — — Investments (Note 9) 40,000 — — 40,000 10 Table of Contents At December 29, 2019 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 180,459 $ 180,459 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,963 126,963 — — Investments in marketable securities 11,982 11,982 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 67,851 67,851 — — Company management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes and the 2019 fixed rate notes as follows: September 6, 2020 December 29, 2019 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 768,000 $ 821,760 $ 774,000 $ 804,960 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 583,500 585,251 588,000 588,588 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 972,500 1,046,410 980,000 1,017,240 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 291,750 291,458 294,000 294,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 416,500 443,156 419,688 431,439 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 392,000 425,320 395,000 414,355 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 669,938 706,114 675,000 675,675 The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. The Company’s variable funding notes are a variable rate loan and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company borrowed $ 158.0 million under its variable funding notes in the second quarter of 2020. The Company repaid $ 100.0 million of these borrowings in the second quarter of 2020 and approximately $ 58.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. The Company had less than $ 0.1 million of outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at September 6, 2020. The Company did no t have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes as of December 29, 2019. The fair values in the table above represent the fair value of such notes at September 6, 2020 and December 29, 2019. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic (discussed further in Note 11) and its impact on financial markets, these fair values fluctuated significantly during the three fiscal quarters of 2020 and may continue to fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors. 6. Revenue Disclosures Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees. Changes in deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees were as follows: Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 6, 2020 September 8, 2019 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at beginning of period $ 20,463 $ 19,900 Revenue recognized during the period ( 4,302 ) ( 3,923 ) New deferrals due to cash received and other 3,937 4,613 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at end of period $ 20,098 $ 20,590 11 Table of Contents Advertising Fund Assets As of September 6, 2020, advertising fund assets, restricted of $ 144.3 million consisted of $ 118.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 20.5 million of accounts receivable and $ 4.9 million of prepaid expenses.

The components of operating and finance lease cost for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 and the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 6, 2020 September 8, 2019 September 6, 2020 September 8, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 10,267 $ 9,150 $ 30,099 $ 29,464 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 548 254 1,248 763 Interest on lease liabilities 794 473 2,066 1,269 Total finance lease cost $ 1,342 $ 727 $ 3,314 $ 2,032 Rent expense totaled $ 17.4 million and $ 50.0 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively, and totaled $ 16.1 million and $ 48.4 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019, respectively. Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rent expense for short-term leases were immaterial for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 and 2019, respectively. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases as of September 6, 2020 and December 29, 2019 was as follows: September 6, 2020 December 29, 2019 Land and buildings $ 45,992 $ 25,476 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 9,208 ) ( 7,846 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 36,784 $ 17,630 Current portion of long-term debt $ 1,662 $ 1,394 Long-term debt, less current portion 36,986 18,263 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 38,648 $ 19,657 As of September 6, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: September 6, 2020 December 29, 2019 Operating Leases Finance Leases Operating Leases Finance Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 7 years 17 years 8 years 14 years Weighted average discount rate 3.8 % 8.9 % 3.8 % 11.7 % 12 Table of Contents Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 and the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019 was as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 6, September 8, September 6, September 8, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 9,288 $ 9,968 $ 29,455 $ 30,056 Operating cash flows from finance leases 794 473 2,066 1,269 Financing cash flows from finance leases 348 161 1,388 422 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease obligations: Operating leases 10,719 23,434 26,297 49,802 Finance leases 1,717 — 20,463 — Maturities of lease liabilities as of September 6, 2020 were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases 2020 $ 15,170 $ 1,275 2021 42,865 4,965 2022 40,942 5,016 2023 35,519 5,075 2024 34,148 4,870 Thereafter 106,034 53,491 Total future minimum rental commitments 274,678 74,692 Less – amounts representing interest ( 36,189 ) ( 36,044 ) Total lease liabilities $ 238,489 $ 38,648 As of September 6, 2020, the Company has additional leases for one supply chain center and certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 28.8 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2020 with lease terms of up to 15 years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above. The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees w a s $ 13.9 million as of September 6, 2020. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 8. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 5.1 million at September 6, 2020 and $ 6.9 million at December 29, 2019. 9. Investment in Dash Brands In the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands for $ 40.0 million. This investment is an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments within long-term other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 40.0 million in the third quarter or three fiscal quarters of 2020. The Company is contractually required to invest an additional $ 40.0 million in Dash Brands in the first quarter of 2021, assuming certain performance conditions are satisfied. If such performance conditions are not satisfied, the Company has the option to make such additional investment at its discretion. 13 Table of Contents 10. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . ASC 326 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted this standard as of December 30, 2019, the first day of its 2020 fiscal year, using the modified retrospective approach and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30 , 2019 for the adoption of ASC 326 were as follows: Balance at December 29, 2019 Adjustments Due to ASC 326 Balance at December 30, 2019 Assets Current assets: Accounts receivable, net $ 210,260 $ 1,435 $ 211,695 Prepaid expenses and other 19,129 4 19,133 Other assets: Other assets 12,521 27 12,548 Deferred income taxes 10,073 ( 364 ) 9,709 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Stockholders’ deficit: Retained deficit ( 3,412,649 ) 1,102 ( 3,411,547 ) The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 326 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained deficit. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. An adjustment to beginning retained deficit and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable of approximately $ 1.5 million was recorded on the date of adoption, representing the remeasurement of these accounts to the Company’s estimate for current expected credit losses. The adjustment to beginning retained deficit was also net of a $ 0.4 million adjustment to deferred income taxes. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standards. ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s floating rate notes and variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may need to renegotiate its loan documents and the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 is currently effective and upon adoption may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 14 Table of Contents 11. COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. During the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to increase its U.S. Stores revenues. Supply Chain also remained operational, with minimal interruptions due to COVID-19 and experienced higher volumes as a result of the increases in store sales. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company’s International Franchise revenues during the second quarter of 2020 due to temporary store closures in certain markets as well as changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across the Company’s international franchise markets. In the third quarter of 2020, these negative impacts lessened due to the reopening and resumption of normal store hours at the majority of the Company’s international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed for portions of the prior quarter. The Company also made certain investments during the COVID-19 pandemic related to safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for the Company’s franchisees and their communities. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business and is unable at this time to predict the continued impact that COVID-19 will have on its business, financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties. 15 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2020 and 2019 third quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended September 6, 2020 and September 8, 2019, respectively. The 2020 and 2019 three fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the thirty-six-week periods ended September 6, 2020 and September 8, 2019, respectively. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 17,200 locations in over 90 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza ® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. Third Quarter Third Quarter Three Fiscal Three Fiscal of 2020 of 2019 Quarters of 2020 Quarters of 2019 Global retail sales growth (versus prior year period, excluding foreign currency impact) +14.8 % +7.5 % +9.6 % +8.1 % Same store sales growth (1): U.S. Company-owned stores +16.6 % +1.7 % +12.4 % +2.3 % U.S. franchise stores +17.5 % +2.5 % +11.6 % +3.2 % U.S. stores +17.5 % +2.4 % +11.7 % +3.1 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +6.2 % +1.7 % +3.0 % +2.0 % Store counts (at end of period): U.S. Company-owned stores 348 333 U.S. franchise stores 5,891 5,652 U.S. stores 6,239 5,985 International stores 11,017 10,543 Total stores (2) 17,256 16,528 Income statement data: Total revenues $ 967.7 100.0 % $ 820.8 100.0 % $ 2,760.8 100.0 % $ 2,468.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 605.7 62.6 % 504.6 61.5 % 1,701.6 61.7 % 1,513.2 61.3 % General and administrative 91.7 9.4 % 83.7 10.2 % 268.2 9.7 % 262.6 10.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 108.1 11.2 % 89.5 10.9 % 309.4 11.2 % 267.1 10.8 % Income from operations 162.2 16.8 % 143.0 17.4 % 481.6 17.4 % 425.5 17.2 % Interest expense, net (38.4 ) (4.0 )% (32.8 ) (4.0 )% (116.0 ) (4.2 )% (100.1 ) (4.0 )% Income before provision for income taxes 123.8 12.8 % 110.2 13.4 % 365.6 13.2 % 325.4 13.2 % Provision for income taxes 24.6 2.6 % 23.9 2.9 % 26.2 0.9 % 54.0 2.2 % Net income $ 99.1 10.2 % $ 86.4 10.5 % $ 339.4 12.3 % $ 271.4 11.0 % (1) Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. (2) Temporary store closures are not treated as store closures and affected stores are included in the ending store count. 16 Table of Contents During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020, we experienced global retail sales growth and U.S. and international same store sales growth. Our commitment to value, convenience, quality and new products continues to keep consumers engaged with the brand. During the third quarter, we launched three new products in the U.S., including chicken wings and two new specialty pizzas, each of which have been positively received by consumers. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 and through the date of this filing, customer ordering behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in U.S. same store sales. We did not experience significant temporary closures in our U.S. business. Additionally, our supply chain experienced minimal disruptions due to COVID-19 and experienced higher volumes from the increases in store sales. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our international franchise revenues during the second quarter of 2020 due to temporary store closures in certain markets as well as changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across our international franchise markets. In the third quarter of 2020, these negative impacts lessened due to the reopening and resumption of normal store hours at the majority of our international franchised stores that had been temporarily closed for portions of the prior quarter. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth was also partially offset by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete. We also continued our global expansion with the opening of 83 net new stores in the third quarter of 2020, bringing our year-to-date total to 236. We had 44 net new stores open in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2020. Although 162 gross new stores opened internationally, 123 stores closed, primarily in India. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on anticipated store openings in our international business to-date due to delays in approvals and government restrictions in certain of the markets that our master franchisees operate. Overall, we believe this global store growth, along with our strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, which includes total retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores worldwide, increased 14.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 9.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were driven by U.S. and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in store counts during the trailing four quarters. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset this increase, resulting from a generally stronger U.S. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete. U.S. same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms, as well as shifts in consumer behavior across the restaurant industry toward delivery and larger order sizes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. International same store sales growth also reflected continued positive performance but has been adversely affected by temporary store closures in certain of our international markets as discussed above. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of September 6, 2020, there were fewer than 400 international stores temporarily closed. Total revenues increased $146.9 million, or 17.9%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $292.4 million, or 11.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were due primarily to higher U.S. retail sales, which resulted in higher supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. U.S. Company-owned stores revenues increased in the third quarter of 2020 and three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to same store sales growth, but were partially offset in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to the sale of 59 Company-owned stores to certain of our existing U.S. franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 (the “2019 Store Sale”). International franchise revenues in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020 were pressured by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and targeted financial relief provided to certain of our master franchisees. These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $19.2 million, or 13.4%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $56.1 million, or 13.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from our U.S. franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. Higher general and administrative expenses partially offset these increases. Net income increased $12.8 million, or 14.8%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $68.0 million, or 25.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020, driven by higher income from operations, partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from a higher average debt balance following our recapitalization transaction completed on November 19, 2019 (the “2019 Recapitalization”) and, to a lesser extent, borrowings under our variable funding notes in 2020. Net income in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 also benefited from lower tax expense resulting primarily from higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.

The increase in revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 was partially offset by lower revenues resulting from the 2019 Store Sale. Company-owned same store sales increased 16.6% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 12.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Company-owned same store sales increased 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 2.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $21.1 million, or 21.6%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $46.6 million, or 16.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth. U.S. franchise royalties were negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 related to funding we provided to our franchisees for an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 17.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 11.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 2.5% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 3.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. franchise royalties and fees further benefited in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2020 from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $18.6 million, or 20.8%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $42.3 million, or 15.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth. Supply Chain Supply chain revenues increased $88.6 million, or 18.3%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $200.7 million, or 14.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were primarily due to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from U.S. franchise retail sales growth. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 3.8% during the third quarter of 2020, which resulted in an estimated $19.7 million increase in supply chain revenues. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 1.9% during the three fiscal quarters of 2020, which resulted in an estimated $28.1 million increase in supply chain revenues. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees were flat in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased $3.9 million, or 2.4%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue from international royalties and fees by $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2020 and $4.3 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Temporary store closures in certain markets and changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across certain of the markets in which we operate, as well as targeted financial relief provided to certain of our master franchisees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, also had a negative impact on international franchise revenues in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020. These pressures were partially offset by same store sales growth. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 6.2% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 3.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 2.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Third Quarter Third Quarter Three Fiscal Three Fiscal of 2020 of 2019 Quarters of 2020 Quarters of 2019 Consolidated revenues $ 967.7 100.0 % $ 820.8 100.0 % $ 2,760.8 100.0 % $ 2,468.4 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 605.7 62.6 % 504.6 61.5 % 1,701.6 61.6 % 1,513.2 61.3 % Consolidated operating margin $ 362.0 37.4 % $ 316.3 38.5 % $ 1,059.2 38.4 % $ 955.2 38.7 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $45.7 million, or 14.5%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $104.0 million, or 10.9%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher U.S. franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin decreased 1.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased 0.3 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 4.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased 1.6 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Supply chain operating margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in the third quarter of 2020 and remained flat in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These changes in operating margin are more fully discussed below.

The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin decreased $3.7 million, or 4.9%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to the 2019 Store Sale and to a lesser extent, higher labor costs, partially offset by same store sales growth. As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 4.5 percentage points in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased 1.6 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below. • Food costs increased 0.1 percentage points to 27.5% in the third quarter of 2020 due to higher food prices, partially offset by the leveraging of higher same store sales. Food costs decreased 0.1 percentage points to 27.0% in the first three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to the leveraging of higher same store sales. • Labor costs increased 3.7 percentage points to 31.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 1.4 percentage points to 31.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to additional compensation expense for frontline team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the three fiscal quarters of 2020, these increases were partially offset by reduced labor costs as a percentage of store revenues resulting from the 2019 Store Sale due to the higher labor rates in the market in which the sold stores operated. • Occupancy costs decreased 0.8 percentage points to 7.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased 0.4 percentage points to 7.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales. • Repairs and maintenance cost increased 0.9 percentage points to 1.8% in the third quarter of 2020 and increased 0.4 percentage points to 1.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to preventative maintenance in our stores.

As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in the third quarter of 2020 and remained flat in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher food costs, partially offset in the third quarter of 2020 and fully offset in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 by lower labor and delivery costs as a percentage of revenues. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $8.0 million, or 9.5%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $5.6 million, or 2.1%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020, driven by higher variable performance-based compensation expense. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $18.6 million, or 20.8%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $42.3 million, or 15.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $5.6 million, or 17.2%, in the third quarter of 2020 and increased $15.9 million, or 15.9%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 driven primarily by higher average debt balances resulting from the 2019 Recapitalization and borrowings under the Company’s variable funding notes in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2020, from 4.1% in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2019, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $0.8 million, or 3.2%, in the third quarter of 2020 due to higher pre-tax income, partially offset by higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision. Provision for income taxes decreased $27.8 million, or 51.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The Company recognized $3.4 million in excess tax benefits in the third quarter of 2020 as compared to $1.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 and recognized $56.9 million in excess tax benefits in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 as compared to $19.7 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, resulting from a significant increase in stock options exercised in 2020 as compared to 2019. The effective tax rate decreased to 19.9% in the third quarter of 2020 and decreased to 7.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 as compared to 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and 16.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. COVID-19 Impact As of September 6, 2020, nearly all of our U.S. stores remained open, with stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of September 6, 2020, there were fewer than 400 international stores temporarily closed. As discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, given the market uncertainty arising from COVID-19, we took a precautionary measure and borrowed $158.0 million under our variable funding notes during the second quarter of 2020. We repaid $100.0 million of these borrowings during the second quarter of 2020 and $58.0 million in the third quarter of 2020. As of September 6, 2020, we had less than $0.1 million outstanding under our variable funding notes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we also made certain investments related to safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and compensation for frontline team members and support for our franchisees and their communities. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and, as a result, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of September 6, 2020, we had working capital of $301.7 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $160.3 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $144.3 million and advertising fund liabilities of $138.3 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $330.7 million. During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2020, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our U.S. and international businesses grew store counts in the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2020. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 6, 2020. Based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of September 6, 2020, we had approximately $113.6 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $46.1 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.6 million of other restricted cash for a total of $160.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 6, 2020, we also held $118.9 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand. Long-Term Debt As of September 6, 2020, we had approximately $4.11 billion of total debt, of which $43.7 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $10.5 million in the remainder of 2020, $42.0 million in 2021, $897.0 million in 2022, $33.0 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.15 billion in 2025, $20.8 million in 2026, $1.28 billion in 2027, $6.8 million in 2028 and $614.3 million in 2029. As of September 6, 2020, we had less than $0.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and approximately $160.0 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $40.0 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock on October 4, 2019. During the first week of the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased and retired 271,064 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $79.6 million. We did not repurchase and retire any shares of our common stock during the remainder of the first quarter or during the second or third quarters of 2020. As of September 6, 2020, the Company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $326.6 million. 21 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 384,338 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $93.7 million. During the three fiscal quarters of 2019, we repurchased and retired 430,182 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $105.1 million. Dividends On June 30, 2020, the Company paid a $0.78 dividend to its shareholders of record as of June 15, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, on July 15, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2020, which was paid on September 30, 2020. Subsequent to the third quarter, on October 6, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2020 to be paid on December 30, 2020. The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 370.4 $ 324.6 Net cash used in investing activities (91.1 ) (3.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (153.6 ) (246.3 ) Exchange rate changes 0.2 0.1 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 126.0 $ 75.3 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $45.8 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020 due to an increase in net income of $68.0 million and higher non-cash amounts of $6.6 million. These increases were partially offset by a $28.8 million negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2020 as compared to 2019, which primarily related to an increase in our inventory and accounts receivable balances, as well as the timing of payments on accounts payable. These operating asset and liability changes were partially offset by an increase in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to lower spending of fund assets. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $91.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020, which consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $51.2 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate stores) and the investment in Dash Brands of $40.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was $3.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. We used $42.7 million of cash for capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). This use of cash was partially offset by maturities of advertising fund investments, restricted of $30.2 million and proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.7 million, which primarily related to the 2019 Store Sale. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $153.6 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. We borrowed $158.0 million under our variable funding notes during the three fiscal quarters of 2020 and repaid $190.8 million of long-term debt (of which approximately $158.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes). We also repurchased approximately $79.6 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program in the first week of 2020, made dividend payments to our shareholders of $61.1 million and made tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $6.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $26.5 million. Cash used in financing activities was $246.3 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily related to purchases of common stock of $105.1 million under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, repayments of long-term debt of $91.9 million (of which $65.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes), dividend payments to our shareholders of $53.6 million and tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $5.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.1 million. 22 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at September 6, 2020, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of September 6, 2020, we had less than $0.1 million of outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 5.6% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2020, approximately 5.8% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2020, approximately 6.7% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2019 and approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange rate risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $14.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Stuart A. Levy, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Levy concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended September 6, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned a $9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic such as COVID-19 poses the risk that we and/or our employees, franchisees, supply chain centers, suppliers, customers and other partners may be, or may continue to be, prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities, or due to the impact of the disease itself on the business’ workforces. In addition, COVID-19 may impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of our 2019 Form 10-K, including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy, our supply chain and increased food and labor costs, disruption in operations, loss of key employees, our indebtedness, general economic conditions and our international operations. In response to governmental requirements, we and our franchisees have, among other measures, temporarily closed certain of our stores, modified certain stores’ hours and closed locations to in-store dining, and continue to monitor additional developments. We have also made additional operating changes to respond to changes in consumer behavior resulting from COVID-19, including offering contactless delivery and carryout options to our customers. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 could have on our business going forward, the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken by governments or by us in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain, including our access to face coverings and gloves for use in our operations, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company’s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including inflation, deflation, prolonged weak consumer demand, political instability or other changes. The significance of the operational and financial impact to the Company will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by COVID-19, and the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it, prove to be. 25 Table of Contents Item 2.

tabular amounts in thousands, except percentages, share and per share amounts) June 14, 2020 1. Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended June 14, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending January 3, 2021 . Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”) in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for the measurement of credit losses below. Refer to Note 10 for information related to the impact of the adoption of ASC 326 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Credit Losses The Company closely monitors accounts and notes receivable balances and estimates the allowance for credit losses. These estimates are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company’s allowances for accounts and notes receivable have not historically been material. The Company also monitors its off-balance sheet exposures under its letters of credit, surety bonds and lease guarantees. None of these arrangements has had or is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. During the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands Ltd., a privately-held business company limited by shares incorporated with limited liability under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“Dash Brands”), for $ 40.0 million. Through its subsidiaries, Dash Brands serves as the Company’s master franchisee in China that owns and operates Domino’s Pizza stores in that market. As a result of the investment, the Company’s significant accounting policy related to equity investments without readily determinable fair values is stated below. Refer to Note 9 for information related to this investment and its impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments and are classified as long-term other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Any adjustments to the carrying amount are recognized in other income (expense), net in the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of its investments based on various analyses including financial results and operating trends, implied values from recent similar transactions and other relevant available information. If the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the estimated fair value of the investment, an impairment loss is recognized, and the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. 7 Table of Contents 2. Segment Information The following table summarizes revenues, income from operations and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of the Company’s Level 3 investment (Note 9) is not readily determinable. The fair value represents its cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of certain assets at June 14 , 2020 and December 29 , 2019 : At June 14, 2020 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 223,664 $ 223,664 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 167,319 167,319 — — Investments in marketable securities 11,278 11,278 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 71,488 71,488 — — Investments (Note 9) 40,000 — — 40,000 10 Table of Contents At December 29, 2019 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 180,459 $ 180,459 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,963 126,963 — — Investments in marketable securities 11,982 11,982 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 67,851 67,851 — — Company management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes and the 2019 fixed rate notes as follows: June 14, 2020 December 29, 2019 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 770,000 $ 813,120 $ 774,000 $ 804,960 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 585,000 587,340 588,000 588,588 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 975,000 1,042,275 980,000 1,017,240 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 292,500 287,820 294,000 294,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 417,563 441,782 419,688 431,439 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 393,000 424,047 395,000 414,355 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 671,625 699,833 675,000 675,675 The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. The Company’s variable funding notes are a variable rate loan and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company had $ 58.0 million of outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at June 14, 2020 and, subsequent to the second quarter of 2020, repaid $ 15.0 million of these outstanding borrowings. The Company did no t have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes as of December 29, 2019. The fair values in the table above represent the fair value of such notes at June 14, 2020 and December 29, 2019. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic (discussed further in Note 11), these fair values fluctuated significantly during the second quarter and may continue to fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors. 6.

Lease s The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2041. The components of operating and finance lease cost for the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020 and the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Two Fiscal Quarters Ended June 14, 2020 June 16, 2019 June 14, 2020 June 16, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 10,250 $ 9,518 $ 19,832 $ 20,314 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 451 255 700 509 Interest on lease liabilities 897 317 1,272 796 Total finance lease cost $ 1,348 $ 572 $ 1,972 $ 1,305 Rent expense totaled $ 16.2 million and $ 32.6 million in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively, and totaled $ 15.9 million and $ 32.3 million in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019, respectively.

The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $ 14.9 million as of June 14, 2020. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 8. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 2.5 million at June 14, 2020 and $ 6.9 million at December 29, 2019. 9. Investment in Dash Brands In the second quarter of 2020, a subsidiary of the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Dash Brands for $ 40.0 million. This investment is an equity investment without a readily determinable fair value and is recorded at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices resulting from orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairments within long-term other assets in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company did not record any adjustments to the carrying amount of $ 40.0 million in the second quarter ended June 14, 2020. The Company is contractually required to invest an additional $ 40.0 million in Dash Brands in the first quarter of 2021 , assuming certain performance conditions are satisfied . If such performance conditions are not satisfied, the Company has the option to make such additional investment in its discretion. 13 Table of Contents 10. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . ASC 326 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted this standard as of December 30, 2019, the first day of its 2020 fiscal year, using the modified retrospective approach and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2019 for the adoption of ASC 326 were as follows: Balance at December 29, 2019 Adjustments Due to ASC 326 Balance at December 30, 2019 Assets Current assets: Accounts receivable, net $ 210,260 $ 1,435 $ 211,695 Prepaid expenses and other 19,129 4 19,133 Other assets: Other assets 12,521 27 12,548 Deferred income taxes 10,073 ( 364 ) 9,709 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Stockholders’ deficit: Retained deficit ( 3,412,649 ) 1,102 ( 3,411,547 ) The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 326 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained deficit. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. An adjustment to beginning retained deficit and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable of approximately $ 1.5 million was recorded on the date of adoption, representing the remeasurement of these accounts to the Company’s estimate for current expected credit losses. The adjustment to beginning retained deficit was also net of a $ 0.4 million adjustment to deferred income taxes. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standards. ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848) In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The Company’s floating rate notes and variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, the Company may need to renegotiate its loan documents and the Company cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with its lenders. ASU 2020-04 is currently effective and upon adoption may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements . 14 Table of Contents 11. COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to increase its U.S. Stores revenues. Supply Chain also remained operational, with minimal interruptions due to COVID-19 and experienced higher volumes as a result of the increases in store sales. However, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the Company’s International Franchise revenues due to temporary store closures in certain markets as well as changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across its international markets. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business and is unable at this time to predict the continued impact that COVID-19 will have on its business, financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties. 15 Table of Contents Item 2.

The 2020 and 2019 two fiscal quarters referenced herein represent the twenty-four-week periods ended June 14, 2020 and June 16, 2019, respectively. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 17,100 locations in over 90 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. Second Quarter of 2020 Second Quarter of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Global retail sales growth (versus prior year period, excluding foreign currency impact) +8.1 % +8.4 % +7.0 % +8.4 % Same store sales growth (1): U.S. Company-owned stores +16.9 % +2.1 % +10.4 % +2.6 % U.S. franchise stores +16.0 % +3.1 % +8.7 % +3.5 % U.S. stores +16.1 % +3.0 % +8.8 % +3.5 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +1.3 % +2.4 % +1.4 % +2.1 % Store counts (at end of period): U.S. Company-owned stores 346 333 U.S. franchise stores 5,849 5,612 U.S. stores 6,195 5,945 International stores 10,978 10,369 Total stores (2) 17,173 16,314 Income statement data: Total revenues $ 920.0 100.0 % $ 811.6 100.0 % $ 1,793.1 100.0 % $ 1,647.6 100.0 % Cost of sales 562.9 61.2 % 495.0 61.0 % 1,095.9 61.1 % 1,008.7 61.2 % General and administrative 88.1 9.5 % 89.2 11.0 % 176.6 9.9 % 178.9 10.9 % U.S. franchise advertising 105.4 11.5 % 88.5 10.9 % 201.3 11.2 % 177.6 10.8 % Income from operations 163.6 17.8 % 138.9 17.1 % 319.4 17.8 % 282.4 17.1 % Interest expense, net (39.1 ) (4.3 )% (32.9 ) (4.0 )% (77.6 ) (4.3 )% (67.3 ) (4.0 )% Income before provision for income taxes 124.5 13.5 % 106.0 13.1 % 241.8 13.5 % 215.1 13.1 % Provision for income taxes 5.8 0.6 % 13.6 1.7 % 1.5 0.1 % 30.1 1.9 % Net income $ 118.7 12.9 % $ 92.4 11.4 % $ 240.3 13.4 % $ 185.0 11.2 % (1) Same store sales growth is calculated for a given period by including only sales from stores that had sales in the comparable weeks of both years.

(2) Temporary store closures are not treated as store closures and affected stores are included in the ending store count. 16 Table of Contents During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020, we experienced global retail sales growth. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 through the date of this filing, customer ordering behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in U.S. same store sales. We did not experience significant temporary closures in our U.S. business. Additionally, our supply chain experienced minimal disruptions due to COVID-19 and experienced higher volumes from the increases in store sales. However, during the same period, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our international retail sales growth and same store sales growth due to temporary store closures and changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across certain of the markets in which we operate. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth was also partially offset by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020, we also continued our global expansion with the opening of 84 net new stores in the second quarter of 2020, bringing our year-to-date total to 153. We opened 45 net new stores internationally and 39 net new stores in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on anticipated store openings in our international business due to delays in approvals and government restrictions in certain of the markets that our master franchisees operate. Overall, we believe this global store growth, along with our strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, which includes total retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores worldwide, increased 8.1% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 7.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were driven by U.S. and international same store sales growth as well as an increase in U.S. store counts during the trailing four quarters, but were partially offset by a significant number of temporary store closures in certain of our international markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, we reached a peak of approximately 2,400 temporary store closures across our international markets. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of June 14, 2020, there were fewer than 700 international stores temporarily closed. U.S. same store sales growth reflected a shift in consumer behavior across the restaurant industry toward delivery and carryout throughout the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms. Total revenues increased $108.4 million, or 13.4%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $145.5 million, or 8.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were due primarily to higher global retail sales, which resulted in higher supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower international franchise revenues due to the temporary store closures in certain of our markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. U.S. Company-owned stores revenues increased in the second quarter of 2020 due to same store sales growth, but decreased in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due to the sale of 59 Company-owned stores to certain of our existing U.S. franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 (the “2019 Store Sale”). These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $24.7 million, or 17.8%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $37.0 million, or 13.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from our U.S. franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. Lower international franchise royalty revenues resulting primarily from temporary store closures in certain of our markets due to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset these increases. Net income increased $26.3 million, or 28.5%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $55.3 million, or 29.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020, driven by higher income from operations and lower tax expense resulting primarily from higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. This increase in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from a higher average debt balance following our recapitalization transaction completed on November 19, 2019 (the “2019 Recapitalization”) and borrowings under our variable funding notes in the second quarter of 2020.

Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. 17 Table of Contents U.S. Stores Revenues Second Quarter of 2020 Second Quarter of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 114.2 34.3 % $ 105.0 36.3 % $ 216.6 34.1 % $ 228.5 38.2 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 113.1 34.0 % 95.6 33.1 % 217.8 34.2 % 192.3 32.1 % U.S. franchise advertising 105.4 31.7 % 88.5 30.6 % 201.3 31.7 % 177.6 29.7 % U.S. stores $ 332.8 100.0 % $ 289.1 100.0 % $ 635.7 100.0 % $ 598.4 100.0 % U.S. Company-Owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $9.2 million, or 8.8%, in the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to same store sales growth, partially offset by lower revenues resulting from the 2019 Store Sale. Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $11.9 million, or 5.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to the 2019 Store Sale, partially offset by higher revenues resulting from same store sales growth. Company-owned same store sales increased 16.9% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 10.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. Company-owned same store sales increased 2.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 2.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $17.5 million, or 18.3%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $25.5 million, or 13.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the 2019 Store Sale. U.S. franchise royalties were negatively impacted by $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2020 related to funding we provided to our franchisees for an effort to donate 10 million slices of pizza to people and organizations at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in the franchisees’ local communities. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 16.0% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 8.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 3.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $16.9 million, or 19.1%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $23.7 million, or 13.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the 2019 Store Sale. Supply Chain Revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Supply chain revenues increased $71.6 million, or 15.3%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $112.2 million, or 11.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These increases were primarily due to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from U.S. franchise retail sales growth. Our market basket pricing to stores decreased 1.2% during the second quarter of 2020, which resulted in an estimated $6.4 million decrease in supply chain revenue. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 0.9% during the two fiscal quarters of 2020, which resulted in an estimated $10.7 million increase in supply chain revenue. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees decreased $6.9 million, or 12.5%, in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased $4.0 million, or 3.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These decreases were due primarily to temporary store closures in certain markets and changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across certain of the markets in which we operate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2020 and $3.7 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 also contributed to the decrease in international royalties and fees revenues. These decreases were partially offset by same store sales growth. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.3% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 1.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 2.1% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2020 Second Quarter of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Consolidated revenues $ 920.0 100.0 % $ 811.6 100.0 % $ 1,793.1 100.0 % $ 1,647.6 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 562.9 61.2 % 495.0 61.0 % 1,095.9 61.1 % 1,008.7 61.2 % Consolidated operating margin $ 357.1 38.8 % $ 316.7 39.0 % $ 697.2 38.9 % $ 639.0 38.8 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $40.4 million, or 12.8%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $58.2 million, or 9.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher U.S. franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Lower international franchise royalties and fee revenues negatively impacted the consolidated operating margin in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin decreased 0.2 percentage points in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 0.1 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 0.2 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. Supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 0.3 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These changes in operating margin are more fully discussed below. U.S. Company-Owned Stores Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2020 Second Quarter of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Revenues $ 114.2 100.0 % $ 105.0 100.0 % $ 216.6 100.0 % $ 228.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 87.8 76.9 % 80.4 76.5 % 167.2 77.2 % 175.9 77.0 % Store operating margin $ 26.4 23.1 % $ 24.6 23.5 % $ 49.3 22.8 % $ 52.5 23.0 % The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) increased $1.8 million, or 7.2%, in the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales, partially offset by the 2019 Store Sale and higher labor costs. The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin decreased $3.2 million, or 6.1%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to the 2019 Store Sale, partially offset by same store sales growth. Operating margin in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2020 was also negatively impacted by higher labor costs, partially offset by higher same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 0.4 percentage points in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 0.2 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below. • Food costs decreased 1.2 percentage points to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020 due to the leveraging of higher same store sales and lower food prices. Food costs decreased 0.3 percentage points to 26.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales, partially offset by higher food prices. • Labor costs increased 2.5 percentage points to 31.9% in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 0.3 percentage points to 30.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to additional bonus pay provided to front-line team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by reduced labor costs as a percentage of store revenues resulting from the 2019 Store Sale due to the high labor rates in the market in which the sold stores operated. • Occupancy costs decreased 0.9 percentage points to 6.9% in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased 0.2 percentage points to 7.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to lower rent costs. Supply Chain Operating Margin Second Quarter of 2020 Second Quarter of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Revenues $ 539.1 100.0 % $ 467.6 100.0 % $ 1,051.8 100.0 % $ 939.7 100.0 % Cost of sales 475.1 88.1 % 414.6 88.7 % 928.7 88.3 % 832.7 88.6 % Supply chain operating margin $ 64.0 11.9 % $ 53.0 11.3 % $ 123.2 11.7 % $ 106.9 11.4 % 19 Table of Contents The supply chain operating margin increased $11.0 million, or 20.9%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $16.3 million, or 15.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the second quarter of 2020 and increased 0.3 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to lower delivery costs. The increase in margin for the two fiscal quarters of 2020 was partially offset by higher food costs as a percentage of supply chain revenues. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 1.3%, in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased $2.3 million, or 1.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020, driven by lower travel expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees. A $2.4 million pre-tax loss related to the 2019 Store Sale also contributed to the decreases. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $16.9 million, or 19.1%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $23.7 million, or 13.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $6.2 million, or 18.6%, in the second quarter of 2020 and increased $10.3 million, or 15.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 driven primarily by higher average debt balances resulting from the 2019 Recapitalization and borrowings under the Company’s variable funding notes in the second quarter of 2020. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2020, from 4.1% in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2020 as compared to the same periods in 2019. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $7.8 million, or 57.2%, in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased $28.6 million, or 94.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due primarily to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The Company recognized $23.0 million in excess tax benefits in the second quarter of 2020 as compared to $9.9 million in the second quarter of 2019 and recognized $53.4 million in excess tax benefits in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 as compared to $18.4 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, resulting from a significant increase in stock options exercised in 2020 as compared to 2019. The effective tax rate decreased to 4.7% in the second quarter of 2020 and decreased to 0.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 as compared to 12.9% in the second quarter of 2019 and 14.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. COVID-19 Impact As of July 8, 2020, nearly all of our U.S. stores remain open, with dining rooms closed and stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of July 8, 2020, there were fewer than 600 international stores temporarily closed. As discussed further in “Liquidity and Capital Resources”, given the market uncertainty arising from COVID-19, we took a precautionary measure and borrowed $158.0 million under our variable funding notes during the second quarter of 2020. We subsequently repaid $100.0 million of these borrowings during the second quarter of 2020. Subsequent to the second quarter of 2020, we repaid an additional $15.0 million under our variable funding notes. In the two fiscal quarters of 2020, we made significant investments in our team members as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including through enhanced sick pay policies and bonuses for our hourly corporate store and supply chain team members. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full continued impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and, as a result, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 20 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of June 14, 2020, we had working capital of $224.8 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $238.2 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $113.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of $108.9 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $248.0 million. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2020, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our international and U.S. businesses grew store counts in the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2020. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of June 14, 2020. Based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of June 14, 2020, we had approximately $188.7 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure (including $58.0 million related to our variable funding notes), $47.3 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $2.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $238.2 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of June 14, 2020, we also held $84.2 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand. Long-Term Debt As of June 14, 2020, we had approximately $4.17 billion of total debt, of which $43.0 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $21.0 million in the remainder of 2020, $42.0 million in 2021, $897.0 million in 2022, $33.0 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.15 billion in 2025, $20.8 million in 2026, $1.28 billion in 2027, $6.8 million in 2028 and $614.3 million in 2029. As of June 14, 2020, we had $58.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and $102.0 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $40.0 million. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter of 2020, we repaid $15.0 million of these outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. As of July 8, 2020, we had $117.0 million of available borrowings under our $200.0 million variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $40.0 million and borrowings outstanding of $43.0 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock on October 4, 2019. 21 Table of Contents During the first week of the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased and retired 271,064 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $79.6 million. We did not repurchase and retire any shares of our common stock during the remainder of the first quarter or during the second quarter of 2020. As of June 14, 2020, the Company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $326.6 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 12,295 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $3.3 million. During the two fiscal quarters of 2019, we repurchased and retired 45,844 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $11.5 million. Dividends On March 30, 2020, the Company paid a $0.78 dividend to its shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020. During the second quarter of 2020, on April 21, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2020, which was paid on June 30, 2020. Subsequent to the second quarter, on July 15, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 15, 2020 to be paid on September 30, 2020. The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Two Fiscal Quarters of 2020 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 211.8 $ 201.6 Net cash used in investing activities (74.2 ) (2.5 ) Net cash used in financing activities (50.9 ) (114.3 ) Exchange rate changes (0.3 ) 0.1 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 86.4 $ 84.8 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $10.2 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020 due to an increase in net income of $55.3 million and higher non-cash amounts of $0.7 million. These increases were partially offset by a $45.7 million negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities, primarily related to an increase in our inventory balance during 2020 as compared to 2019 resulting from increased supply chain volumes and additional inventory for supplies related to the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in our accounts receivable balance during 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to the increase in supply chain volumes and the timing of receipts also negatively impacted cash provided by operating activities during 2020 as compared to 2019. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $74.2 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020, which consisted primarily of the investment in Dash Brands of $40.0 million and capital expenditures of $33.7 million (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and corporate stores). Cash used in investing activities was $2.5 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, which consisted primarily of $25.7 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). This use of cash was partially offset by maturities of advertising fund investments, restricted of $15.2 million and proceeds from the sale of assets of $8.2 million, which primarily related to the 2019 Store Sale. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $50.9 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. We borrowed $158.0 million under our variable funding notes during the two fiscal quarters of 2020 and repaid $122.0 million of long-term debt (of which $100.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes). We also repurchased approximately $79.6 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program in the first week of 2020, made dividend payments to our shareholders of $30.3 million and made tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $1.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $24.8 million. Cash used in financing activities was $114.3 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily related to repayments of long-term debt of $82.9 million (of which $65.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes), dividend payments to our shareholders of $26.7 million, purchases of common stock of $11.5 million under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program and tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $2.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9.3 million. 22 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at June 14, 2020, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of June 14, 2020, we had $58.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Subsequent to the second quarter of 2020, we repaid $15.0 million of these borrowings. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 5.2% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2020, approximately 5.9% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2020,and approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2019 and approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange rate risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $9.3 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey D. Lawrence, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Lawrence concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended June 14, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned a $9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2019 Form 10-K. Our operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations as well. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic such as COVID-19 poses the risk that we and/or our employees, franchisees, supply chain centers, suppliers, customers and other partners may be, or may continue to be, prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities, or due to the impact of the disease itself on the business’ workforces. In addition, COVID-19 may impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of our 2019 Form 10-K, including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy, our supply chain and increased food and labor costs, disruption in operations, loss of key employees, our indebtedness, general economic conditions and our international operations. In response to governmental requirements, we and our franchisees have, among other measures, temporarily closed certain of our stores, modified certain stores’ hours and closed locations to in-store dining, and continue to monitor additional developments. We have also made additional operating changes to respond to changes in consumer behavior resulting from COVID-19, including offering contactless delivery and carryout options to our customers. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 could have on our business going forward, the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken by governments or by us in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain, including our access to face coverings and gloves for use in our operations, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company’s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including inflation, deflation, prolonged weak consumer demand, political instability or other changes.

Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 included in the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020 (the “2019 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended March 22, 2020 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending January 3, 202 1 . Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASC 326”) in the first quarter of 2020. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for the measurement of credit losses below. Refer to Note 9 for information related to the impact of the adoption of ASC 326 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Allowances for Credit Losses The Company closely monitors accounts and notes receivable balances and estimates the allowance for credit losses. These estimates are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events. The Company’s allowance s for accounts and notes receivable have not historically been material. The Company also monitors its off-balance sheet exposures under its letters of credit, surety bonds and lease guarantees. None of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, revenues, expenses or liquidity. 2. Segment Information The following table summarizes revenues, income from operations and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and other, which is the measure by which the Company allocates resources to its segments and which the Company refers to as Segment Income, for each of its reportable segments.

The denominator used in calculating diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020 does not include 84,765 restricted performance shares, as the performance targets for these awards had not yet been met. The denominator used in calculating diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2019 does not include 71,880 options to purchase common stock as the effect of including these options would have been anti-dilutive.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at March 22, 2020 and December 29, 2019: At March 22, 2020 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 173,317 $ 173,317 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 106,225 106,225 — — Investments in marketable securities 10,989 10,989 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 78,134 78,134 — — At December 29, 2019 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 180,459 $ 180,459 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 126,963 126,963 — — Investments in marketable securities 11,982 11,982 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 67,851 67,851 — — 9 Table of Contents Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes, the 2018 fixed rate notes and the 2019 fixed rate notes as follows: March 22, 2020 December 29, 2019 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 772,000 $ 711,784 $ 774,000 $ 804,960 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 586,500 549,551 588,000 588,588 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 977,500 825,010 980,000 1,017,240 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 293,250 251,315 294,000 294,000 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 418,625 387,228 419,688 431,439 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 394,000 351,054 395,000 414,355 2019 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 673,313 544,037 675,000 675,675 The Company’s variable funding notes are a variable rate loan and the fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company did no t have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes at March 22, 2020 or December 29, 2019. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2020, the Company borrowed $ 158.0 million under its variable funding notes . The fair values in the table above represent the fair value of such notes at March 22, 2020 and December 29, 2019. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic (discussed further in Note 10), these fair values fluctuated significantly during the first quarter and may continue to fluctuate based on market conditions and other factors. The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. 6. Revenue Disclosures Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities primarily consist of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees. Changes in deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees for the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 22, March 24, 2020 2019 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at beginning of period $ 20,463 $ 19,900 Revenue recognized during the period ( 1,417 ) ( 1,361 ) New deferrals due to cash received and other 724 900 Deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees at end of period $ 19,770 $ 19,439 Advertising Fund Assets As of March 22, 2020, advertising fund assets, restricted of $ 110.0 million consisted of $ 88.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 19.5 million of accounts receivable and $ 2.3 million of prepaid expenses.

Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2041. The components of operating and finance lease cost for the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 22, March 24, 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 9,582 $ 10,796 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 249 254 Interest on lease liabilities 375 479 Total finance lease cost $ 624 $ 733 Rent expense totaled $ 16.4 million in both the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019, and includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rent expense for short-term leases were immaterial in both the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s finance leases as of March 22, 2020 and December 29, 2019 was as follows: March 22, December 29, 2020 2019 Land and buildings $ 25,167 $ 25,476 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 8,083 ) ( 7,846 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 17,084 $ 17,630 Current portion of long-term debt $ 1,390 $ 1,394 Long-term debt, less current portion 17,616 18,263 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 19,006 $ 19,657 As of March 22, 2020 and December 29, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: March 22, 2020 December 29, 2019 Operating Finance Operating Finance Leases Leases Leases Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 8 years 14 years 8 years 14 years Weighted average discount rate 3.8 % 11.7 % 3.8 % 11.7 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2019 was as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended March 22, March 2 4 , 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 10,119 $ 10,690 Operating cash flows from finance leases 375 479 Financing cash flows from finance leases 349 155 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 8,982 12,977 Finance leases — — 11 Table of Contents Maturities of lease liabilities as of March 22, 2020 were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases 2020 $ 33,683 $ 2,467 2021 40,956 2,775 2022 38,068 2,792 2023 32,776 2,815 2024 31,228 2,839 Thereafter 96,570 25,493 Total future minimum rental commitments 273,281 39,181 Less – amounts representing interest ( 37,063 ) ( 20,175 ) Total lease liabilities $ 236,218 $ 19,006 As of March 22, 2020, the Company has additional leases for two supply chain centers and certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 68.6 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2020 with lease terms of up to 21 years. One of the supply chain center leases commenced in the second quarter of 2020. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the table above. The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees was $ 15.8 million as of March 22, 2020. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues , expenses or liquidity. 8 . Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 3.4 million at March 22, 2020 and $ 6.9 million at December 29, 2019. 9 . New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . ASC 326 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company adopted this standard as of December 30, 2019, the first day of its 2020 fiscal year, using the modified retrospective approach and it did not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2019 for the adoption of ASC 326 were as follows: Balance at December 29, 2019 Adjustments Due to ASC 326 Balance at December 30, 2019 Assets Current assets: Accounts receivable, net $ 210,260 $ 1,435 $ 211,695 Prepaid expenses and other 19,129 4 19,133 Other assets: Other assets 12,521 27 12,548 Deferred income taxes 10,073 ( 364 ) 9,709 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Stockholders’ deficit: Retained deficit ( 3,412,649 ) 1,102 ( 3,411,547 ) 12 Table of Contents The Company recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying ASC 326 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained deficit. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for that period. An adjustment to beginning retained deficit and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable of approximately $ 1.5 million was recorded on the date of adoption, representing the remeasurement of these accounts to Company’s estimate for current expected credit losses. The adjustment to beginning retained deficit was also net of a $ 0.4 million adjustment to deferred income taxes. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740) In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12) , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including applicable interim periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 10. COVID-19 Pandemic In December 2019, a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) was reported and in January 2020, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On February 28, 2020, the WHO raised its assessment of the COVID-19 threat from high to very high at a global level due to the continued increase in the number of cases and affected countries, and on March 11, 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions to its operations during the first quarter of 2020 from COVID-19, it is unable at this time to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its business, financial position and operating results in future periods due to numerous uncertainties and is closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business. 13 Table of Contents Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2020 and 2019 first quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended March 22, 2020 and March 24, 2019. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 17,000 locations in over 90 markets around the world. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. We believe that everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza ® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 Global retail sales growth (versus prior year period, excluding foreign currency impact) +5.9 % +8.5 % Same store sales growth (1): U.S. Company-owned stores +3.9 % +2.1 % U.S. franchise stores +1.5 % +4.1 % U.S. stores +1.6 % +3.9 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +1.5 % +1.8 % Store counts (at end of period): U.S. Company-owned stores 345 392 U.S. franchise stores 5,811 5,511 U.S. stores 6,156 5,903 International stores 10,933 10,211 Total stores (2) 17,089 16,114 Income statement data: Total revenues $ 873.1 100.0 % $ 836.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 532.9 61.0 % 513.7 61.4 % General and administrative 88.5 10.2 % 89.7 10.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 95.8 11.0 % 89.1 10.7 % Income from operations 155.8 17.8 % 143.5 17.2 % Interest expense, net (38.5 ) (4.4 )% (34.4 ) (4.1 )% Income before provision for income taxes 117.3 13.4 % 109.1 13.1 % (Benefit) provision for income taxes (4.3 ) (0.5 )% 16.5 2.0 % Net income $ 121.6 13.9 % $ 92.7 11.1 % (1) Same store sales growth is calculated by including only sales for a given period from stores that had sales in the comparable weeks of both years. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. (2) Temporary store closures due to COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 are not treated as store closures and affected stores are included in the ending store count. 14 Table of Contents During the first quarter of 2020, we experienced global retail sales growth. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth remained positive but was pressured by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020 through the date of this filing, while we have seen an increase in U.S. same store sales, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted our global retail sales growth and, in our international business, same store sales growth due to temporary store closures and changes in operating procedures and store hours resulting from actions taken to increase social distancing across the markets in which we operate. We continued our global expansion with the opening of 69 net new stores in the first quarter of 2020. Although we opened 143 gross new stores internationally, we also closed 104 stores, primarily resulting from the closure of our South Africa market, unrelated to COVID-19, comprising 71 stores in total. We also opened 30 net new stores in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2020. Overall, we believe our continued global store growth, along with our sales growth, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand. Global retail sales, excluding foreign currency impact, which includes total retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores worldwide, increased 5.9% in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was driven by an increase in worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters as well as U.S. and international same store sales growth. U.S. same store sales growth reflected positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms. International same store sales growth also reflected continued positive performance. Total revenues increased $37.1 million, or 4.4%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher supply chain food volumes as well as higher global franchise revenues resulting from retail sales growth. These increases in revenues were partially offset by lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues resulting from the sale of 59 Company-owned stores to certain of our existing U.S. franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 (the “2019 Store Sale”). These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $12.3 million, or 8.6%, in the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from U.S. and international franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. Income from operations was negatively impacted by lower Company-owned store margins and changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased $29.0 million, or 31.2%, in the first quarter of 2020, driven by lower tax expense resulting primarily from higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation and higher income from operations, as noted above. This increase in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from a higher average debt balance following our recapitalization transaction completed on November 19, 2019 (the “2019 Recapitalization”). Revenues First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 102.3 11.7 % $ 123.5 14.8 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 104.7 12.0 % 96.7 11.6 % Supply chain 512.7 58.7 % 472.1 56.4 % International franchise royalties and fees 57.5 6.6 % 54.6 6.5 % U.S. franchise advertising 95.8 11.0 % 89.1 10.7 % Total revenues $ 873.1 100.0 % $ 836.0 100.0 % Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties, advertising contributions and fees from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 102.3 33.8 % $ 123.5 39.9 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 104.7 34.6 % 96.7 31.3 % U.S. franchise advertising 95.8 31.6 % 89.1 28.8 % U.S. stores $ 302.9 100.0 % $ 309.3 100.0 % U.S. Company-Owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations decreased $21.2 million, or 17.1%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to the 2019 Store Sale. This decrease in revenues was partially offset by higher same store sales. Company-owned same store sales increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2020 and 2.1% in the first quarter of 2019. 15 Table of Contents U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $8.0 million, or 8.3%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the 2019 Store Sale. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 1.5% in the first quarter of 2020 and 4.1% in the first quarter of 2019. U.S. franchise royalties and fees further benefited from an increase in revenues from fees paid by franchisees for the use of our technology platforms. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $6.7 million, or 7.5%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period, due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the 2019 Store Sale. Supply Chain Revenues from supply chain operations are primarily comprised of sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to substantially all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Supply chain revenues increased $40.6 million, or 8.6%, in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from an increase in the average number of U.S. franchise stores open during the year and an increase in market basket pricing to stores. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.9% during the first quarter of 2020, which resulted in an estimated $15.9 million increase in supply chain revenue. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $2.9 million, or 5.3%, in the first quarter of 2020. This increase was due primarily to an increase in the average number of international stores open during the period and higher same store sales. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.4 million partially offset the increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2020. International franchise same store sales increased 1.5% in the first quarter of 2020 and increased 1.8% in the first quarter of 2019. Cost of Sales / Operating Margin First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 Consolidated revenues $ 873.1 100.0 % $ 836.0 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 532.9 61.0 % 513.7 61.4 % Consolidated operating margin $ 340.2 39.0 % $ 322.3 38.6 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $17.9 million, or 5.5%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020 and supply chain operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020. These changes in margin are more fully discussed below. U.S. Company-Owned Stores Operating Margin First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 Revenues $ 102.3 100.0 % $ 123.5 100.0 % Cost of sales 79.4 77.6 % 95.5 77.4 % Store operating margin $ 22.9 22.4 % $ 27.9 22.6 % The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $5.0 million, or 17.8%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to the 2019 Store Sale. 16 Table of Contents As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed in more detail below. • Food costs increased 0.7 percentage points to 27.8% in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher food prices. • Labor costs decreased 1.8 percentage points to 29.0% in the first quarter of 2020. The 2019 Store Sale contributed to the reduction in labor costs as a percentage of store revenues due to the high labor rates in the market in which the sold stores operated. The reduction in labor costs as a percentage of store revenues was partially offset by an increase in average labor rates in our remaining Company-owned store markets, including additional bonus pay resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. • Insurance costs increased 0.5 percentage points to 3.4% in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to unfavorable claims experience. • Delivery costs increased 0.4 percentage points to 3.6% in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to a higher average per-mile reimbursement rate for our delivery drivers. • Occupancy costs increased 0.4 percentage points to 8.0% in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher depreciation costs. Supply Chain Operating Margin First Quarter First Quarter of 2020 of 2019 Revenues $ 512.7 100.0 % $ 472.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 453.6 88.5 % 418.1 88.6 % Supply chain operating margin $ 59.1 11.5 % $ 54.0 11.4 % The supply chain operating margin increased $5.1 million, or 9.6%, in the first quarter of 2020, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased store orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to lower labor, delivery and insurance costs, offset in part by higher food costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 1.3%, in the first quarter of 2020, driven by lower performance-based compensation expense and lower advertising expenses, partially offset by higher health insurance costs. The decrease in advertising expenses resulted primarily from the 2019 Store Sale. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $6.7 million, or 7.5%, in the first quarter of 2020, consistent with the increase in U.S. franchise advertising revenue. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $4.1 million, or 12.2%, in the first quarter of 2020 driven primarily by higher average debt balances resulting from the 2019 Recapitalization. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 4.0% in the first quarter of 2020, from 4.1% in the first quarter of 2019, resulting from the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2020 following the 2019 Recapitalization as compared to the same period in 2019. (Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes Income tax expense decreased $20.8 million, or 126.1%, in the first quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher excess tax benefits on equity-based compensation, which are recorded as a reduction to the income tax provision, partially offset by higher pre-tax income. The Company recognized $30.4 million in excess tax benefits in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, resulting from a significant increase in stock options exercised in the first quarter of 2020 as compared to the first quarter of 2019. The effective tax rate decreased to negative 3.7% during the first quarter of 2020 as compared to 15.1% in the first quarter of 2019. 17 Table of Contents COVID-19 Impact As of April 21, 2020, nearly all of our U.S. stores remain open, with dining rooms closed and stores deploying contactless delivery and carryout solutions. Based on information reported to us by our master franchisees, we estimate that as of April 21, 2020, there are approximately 1,750 international stores that are temporarily closed. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we borrowed $158.0 million under our outstanding variable funding notes as a precautionary measure due to the market uncertainty arising from COVID-19. These borrowings, along with our current unrestricted cash as of the end of the first quarter, provided us with approximately $358.8 million in cash on hand to provide enhanced financial flexibility. Beginning at the end of the first quarter of 2020, we have begun making significant investments in our team members as a result of this pandemic, including through enhanced sick pay policies and bonuses for our hourly corporate store and supply chain team members. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt our continuing operations and supply chain and, as a result, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of March 22, 2020, we had working capital of $149.7 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $189.4 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $110.0 million and advertising fund liabilities of $106.8 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $200.8 million. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we borrowed $158.0 million under our outstanding variable funding notes as a precautionary measure due to the market uncertainty arising from COVID-19. During the first quarter of 2020, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable period in the prior year. Additionally, our international and U.S. businesses grew store counts in the first quarter of 2020. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of March 22, 2020. Based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of March 22, 2020, we had approximately $140.1 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $48.4 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.9 million of other restricted cash for a total of $189.4 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of March 22, 2020, we also held $88.2 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s brand. 18 Table of Contents Long-Term Debt As of March 22, 2020, we had approximately $4.10 billion of long-term debt, of which $43.4 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $31.5 million in the remainder of 2020, $42.0 million in 2021, $897.0 million in 2022, $33.0 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.15 billion in 2025, $20.8 million in 2026, $1.28 billion in 2027, $6.8 million in 2028 and $614.3 million in 2029. As of March 22, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and $158.6 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $41.4 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. As discussed above, subsequent to the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $158.0 million of the remaining availability under our variable funding notes. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess operating cash flows, excess proceeds from our recapitalization transactions and borrowings under our variable funding notes. During the first week of the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased and retired 271,064 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $79.6 million. The Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock on October 4, 2019. As of March 22, 2020, the Company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $326.6 million. During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 33,549 shares for approximately $8.1 million. Dividends On February 19, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of March 13, 2020 which was paid on March 30, 2020. We had approximately $31.0 million accrued for common stock dividends at March 22, 2020. Subsequent to the first quarter, on April 21, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.78 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 15, 2020 to be paid on June 30, 2020. The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) First Quarter of 2020 First Quarter of 2019 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 95.4 $ 97.0 Net cash used in investing activities (17.9 ) (12.0 ) Net cash used in financing activities (82.1 ) (55.1 ) Exchange rate changes (1.0 ) 0.1 Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ (5.6 ) $ 30.0 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2020 due to the negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $32.2 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of $29.0 million and higher non-cash amounts of $1.6 million. The negative impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities in 2020 as well as the timing of collections on accounts receivable in 2020 as compared to 2019. These negative impacts of changes in operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the positive impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted in 2020 as compared to 2019, due primarily to the timing of advertising spend. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $17.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, which consisted primarily of $17.5 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). Cash used in investing activities was $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2019, which consisted primarily of $12.2 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). 19 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $82.1 million in the first quarter of 2020, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $79.6 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program in the first week of the quarter, repayments of long-term debt of $10.8 million and tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $1.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.1 million. Cash used in financing activities was $55.1 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to repayments of long-term debt of $49.0 million (of which $40.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes) and the repurchase of approximately $8.1 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at March 22, 2020, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of March 22, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Subsequent to the first quarter of 2020, we borrowed $158.0 million of the remaining availability under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2020 and approximately 6.5% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2020. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey D. Lawrence, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Lawrence concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended March 22, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 21 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned a $9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in Part I of our 2019 Form 10-K. Our operations and results could be adversely affected by the recent outbreak of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The recent outbreak of disease caused by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health pandemic such as COVID-19 poses the risk that we and/or our employees, franchisees, supply chain centers, suppliers, customers and other partners may be, or may continue to be, prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns, travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, stay at home orders and advisories and other restrictions that have been or may be suggested or mandated by governmental authorities, or due to the impact of the disease itself on the workforce of those businesses. In addition, COVID-19 may impact the willingness of customers to purchase food prepared outside of the home. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section of our 2019 Form 10-K, including but not limited to those relating to our growth strategy, our supply chain and increased food and labor costs, disruption in operations, loss of key employees, our indebtedness, general economic conditions and our international operations. In response to governmental requirements, we and our franchisees have, among other measures, temporarily closed certain of our stores, modified certain stores’ hours and closed locations to in-store dining, and continue to monitor additional developments. We have also made additional operating changes to respond to changes in consumer behavior resulting from COVID-19. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, the continued spread of the virus and the measures taken by governments or by us in response have disrupted our operations and could disrupt our supply chain, including our access to face coverings and gloves for use in our operations, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also had an adverse impact on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The Company’s sales and operating results may be affected by uncertain or changing economic and market conditions arising in connection with and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including inflation, deflation, prolonged weak consumer demand, political instability or other changes. The significance of the operational and financial impact to the Company will depend on how long and widespread the disruptions caused by COVID-19, and the corresponding response to contain the virus and treat those affected by it, prove to be. 22 Table of Contents Item 2.

Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended September 8, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019. Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for leases below. Refer to Note 7 for additional information related to the Company’s lease arrangements and Note 11 for the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The majority of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, which are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date for leases exceeding 12 months. Minimum lease payments include only the fixed lease component of the agreement, as well as any variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate for each lease using a portfolio approach based on the respective weighted average term of the agreements. This estimation considers the market rates of the Company’s outstanding collateralized borrowings and interpolations of rates outside of the terms of the outstanding borrowings, including comparisons to comparable borrowings of similarly-rated companies with longer term borrowings. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense. Amortization expense for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales, while interest expense for finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components and short-term rentals (leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred. 7 Table of Contents 2.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at September 8, 2019 and December 30, 2018: At September 8, 2019 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 58,993 $ 58,993 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 104,424 104,424 — — Investments in marketable securities 10,851 10,851 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 57,682 57,682 — — Advertising fund investments, restricted 20,000 20,000 — — 10 Table of Contents At December 30, 2018 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Inputs Inputs Inputs Cash equivalents $ 11,877 $ 11,877 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 112,272 112,272 — — Investments in marketable securities 8,718 8,718 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 31,547 31,547 — — Advertising fund investments, restricted 50,152 50,152 — — Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes and the 2018 fixed rate notes as follows: September 8, 2019 December 30, 2018 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 774,000 $ 817,344 $ 780,000 $ 783,120 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 588,000 590,352 592,500 575,910 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 980,000 1,038,800 987,500 956,888 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 294,000 293,706 296,250 295,065 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 419,688 438,573 422,875 416,955 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 395,000 421,465 398,000 396,010 At September 8, 2019, the Company did no t have any outstanding borrowings under its variable funding notes. The Company had $ 65.0 million outstanding under its variable funding notes at December 30, 2018. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are a variable rate loan. The fair value of this loan approximated book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. 6. Revenue Disclosures Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred franchise fees and deferred development fees. Changes in contract liabilities were as follows: Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 8, September 9, 2019 2018 Contract liabilities at beginning of period $ 19,900 $ 19,404 Revenue recognized during the period ( 3,923 ) ( 3,540 ) New deferrals due to cash received and other 4,613 3,917 Contract liabilities at end of period $ 20,590 $ 19,781 Advertising Fund Assets As of September 8, 2019, advertising fund assets, restricted of $109.5 million consisted of $ 88.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, $ 18.3 million of accounts receivable and $ 2.5 million of prepaid expenses.

Lease Disclosures The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters with expiration dates through 2037. The components of operating and finance lease cost for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019 were as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 8, September 8, 2019 2019 Operating lease cost $ 9,150 $ 29,464 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets 254 763 Interest on lease liabilities 473 1,269 Total finance lease cost $ 727 $ 2,032 Rent expense totaled $ 16.1 million and $ 48.4 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019, respectively, and totaled $ 15.7 million and $ 46.3 million in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2018, respectively. Rent expense includes operating lease cost, as well as expense for non-lease components including common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance for the Company’s real estate leases. Rent expense also includes the variable rate per mile driven and fixed maintenance charges for the Company’s supply chain center tractors and trailers and expense for short-term rentals. Variable rent expense and rental expense for short-term leases was immaterial for both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019. Supplemental balance sheet information related to the Company’s leases as of September 8, 2019 and December 30, 2018 was as follows: September 8, December 30, 2019 2018 Land and buildings $ 22,195 $ 22,171 Accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 7,441 ) ( 6,678 ) Finance lease assets, net $ 14,754 $ 15,493 Current portion of long-term debt $ 685 $ 643 Long-term debt, less current portion 15,922 16,363 Total principal payable on finance leases $ 16,607 $ 17,006 As of September 8, 2019, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s operating and finance leases were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases Weighted average remaining lease term 8 years 14 years Weighted average discount rate 3.8 % 11.4 % Supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019 was as follows: Fiscal Quarter Ended Three Fiscal Quarters Ended September 8, September 8, 2019 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 9,968 $ 30,056 Operating cash flows from finance leases 473 1,269 Financing cash flows from finance leases 161 422 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease obligations: Operating leases 23,434 49,802 Finance leases — — During the first quarter of 2018, the Company renewed the lease of a supply chain center building and extended the term of the lease through 2033 . During the third quarter of 2018, the Company renewed the leases of two supply chain center buildings and extended the terms of the leases through 2036 and 2037 , respectively. As a result of these extended leases, the Company recorded non-cash financing activities of $ 11.4 million for the increase in finance lease assets and liabilities during the three fiscal quarters of 2018. 12 Table of Contents Maturities of lease liabilities as of September 8, 2019 were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases 2019 $ 12,212 $ 791 2020 40,157 2,417 2021 37,979 2,435 2022 34,819 2,453 2023 32,245 2,477 Thereafter 116,664 23,810 Total future minimum rental commitments 274,076 34,383 Less – amounts representing interest ( 39,745 ) ( 17,776 ) Total lease liabilities $ 234,331 $ 16,607 Maturities of lease liabilities as of December 30, 2018 were as follows: Operating Finance Leases Leases 2019 $ 40,752 $ 2,396 2020 37,519 2,415 2021 34,538 2,433 2022 30,763 2,451 2023 27,388 2,474 Thereafter 100,310 23,781 Total future minimum rental commitments $ 271,270 35,950 Less – amounts representing interest ( 18,944 ) Total principal payable on finance leases $ 17,006 As of September 8, 2019, the Company has additional leases for two supply chain centers and certain supply chain tractors and trailers that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 50.6 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2019 with lease terms of up to 15 years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the tables above. The Company has guaranteed lease payments related to certain franchisees’ lease arrangements. The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $ 17.9 million and $ 2.4 million as of September 8, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures or liquidity. 8. Legal Matters On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned a $ 9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100 % liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $ 8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal . 9. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 4.7 million at September 8, 2019 and $ 3.8 million at December 30, 2018. 13 Table of Contents 10. Sale of Company-owned Stores During the second quarter of 2019, the Company sold 59 U.S. Company-owned stores to certain of its existing U.S. franchisees for proceeds of $ 9.7 million, of which $ 8.1 million was received in cash during the second quarter. The remaining $ 1.6 million was collected during the third quarter. In connection with the sale of the stores, the Company recorded a $ 2.4 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, which included a $ 1.4 million reduction in goodwill. The loss was recorded in general and administrative expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. 11. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. On December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of ASC 842 had a material impact on the Company’s assets and liabilities due to the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the optional practical expedient to retain its current classification of leases, and accordingly, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 7 for additional disclosure related to the Company’s lease arrangements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 for the adoption of ASC 842 were as follows: Balance at December 30, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASC 842 Balance at December 31, 2018 Assets Current assets: Prepaid expenses and other $ 25,710 $ ( 35 ) $ 25,675 Property, plant and equipment: Construction in progress 31,822 ( 1,904 ) 29,918 Other assets: Operating lease right-of-use assets — 218,860 218,860 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Current liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 32,033 32,033 Other accrued liabilities 55,001 ( 136 ) 54,865 Long-term liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 194,736 194,736 Other accrued liabilities 40,807 ( 9,712 ) 31,095 On December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment of $ 226.8 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The operating lease right-of-use assets recorded on the date of adoption were also net of a $ 7.9 million reclassification of other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses representing previously deferred (prepaid) rent and lease incentives. The Company also derecognized $ 1.9 million of construction in progress and other long-term accrued liabilities associated with a new building that was leased to the Company in the third quarter of 2019. This lease was previously accounted for as a build-to-suit arrangement under prior lease accounting guidance. 14 Table of Contents ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which aligns the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. ASU 2018-15 also requires companies to amortize these implementation costs over the life of the service contract in the same line in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting service. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this accounting standard prospectively in the third quarter of 2019, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standards. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 15 Table of Contents Item 2.

Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 16,500 locations in over 85 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. Everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza ® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment.

The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. franchise stores in the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019. 16 Table of Contents During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019, we experienced global retail sales growth and positive U.S. and international same store sales growth. Our U.S. carryout business experienced continued strong growth. While our overall U.S. delivery business continues to grow, our U.S. delivery same store sales growth has been pressured by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete as well as from aggressive competitive activity. We also continued our global expansion with the opening of 214 net new stores in the third quarter of 2019, bringing our year-to-date total to 614. We opened 174 net new stores internationally and 40 net new stores in the U.S. during the third quarter of 2019. Overall, we believe this global store growth, along with our strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Global retail sales, which are total worldwide retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores, increased 5.8% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 5.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were driven by an increase in worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters as well as U.S. and international same store sales growth. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset this increase, resulting from a generally stronger U.S. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete. U.S. same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms. International same store sales growth also reflected continued positive performance. Total revenues increased $34.8 million, or 4.4%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $117.7 million, or 5.0%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were due primarily to higher global retail sales, which resulted in higher supply chain and global franchise revenues. The increases in international franchise revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases in revenues were also partially offset by lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues resulting from the sale of 59 Company-owned stores to certain of our existing U.S. franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 (the “Second Quarter Store Sale”). These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $10.6 million, or 8.0%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $33.4 million, or 8.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from U.S. and international franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. A pre-tax gain of $5.9 million recognized from the sale of 12 Company-owned stores in the third quarter of 2018 partially offset these increases. A $2.4 million pre-tax loss related to the Second Quarter Store Sale and continued investments in technological initiatives and other areas also partially offset these increases in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Net income increased $2.3 million, or 2.7%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $21.1 million, or 8.4%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, driven by higher income from operations. These increases in net income were partially offset by a higher effective tax rate in 2019 resulting primarily from lower excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. The increase in net income in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 was also partially offset by higher interest expense resulting from a higher average debt balance and a slightly higher weighted average borrowing rate following our debt recapitalization transaction completed on April 24, 2018 (the “2018 Recapitalization”).

Company-owned store, franchised store and supply chain revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may also vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.

These decreases in revenues were partially offset by higher same store sales. Company-owned same store sales increased 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 2.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Company-owned same store sales increased 4.9% in the third quarter of 2018 and increased 5.4% in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $7.6 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $23.0 million, or 8.6%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the Second Quarter Store Sale. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 2.5% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 3.2% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 6.4% in the third quarter of 2018 and increased 7.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $7.0 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $21.5 million, or 8.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the Second Quarter Store Sale.

These increases were due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from an increase in the average number of U.S. franchise stores open during the period, as a result of the factors described above, and an increase in market basket pricing. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.8% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 2.3% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, which resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. supply chain revenues of $9.8 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $21.6 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. International Supply Chain Revenues from international supply chain operations increased $3.7 million, or 9.0%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $7.7 million, or 6.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders and an increase in market basket pricing. These increases in revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $4.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $4.2 million, or 8.3%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $9.9 million, or 6.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were due primarily to an increase in the average number of international stores open during the period and higher same store sales. These increases in revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.5 million in the third quarter of 2019 and $8.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 2.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 3.3% in the third quarter of 2018 and 4.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Third Quarter Third Quarter Three Fiscal Three Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 Consolidated revenues $ 820.8 100.0 % $ 786.0 100.0 % $ 2,468.4 100.0 % $ 2,350.7 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 504.6 61.5 % 490.7 62.4 % 1,513.2 61.3 % 1,462.0 62.2 % Consolidated operating margin $ 316.3 38.5 % $ 295.3 37.6 % $ 955.2 38.7 % $ 888.7 37.8 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $21.0 million, or 7.1%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $66.5 million, or 7.5%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 0.9 percentage points in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 0.9 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Company-owned store operating margin increased 2.8 percentage points in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 0.9 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Supply chain operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 0.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These changes in operating margin are more fully discussed below.

Operating margin in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2019 was also negatively impacted by higher labor costs, partially offset by higher same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the U.S. Company-owned store operating margin increased 2.8 percentage points in the third quarter of 2019 and increased 0.9 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below. • Food costs decreased 0.3 percentage points to 27.4% in the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 0.4 percentage points to 27.1% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher food prices. • Labor costs decreased 2.2 percentage points to 28.1% in the third quarter of 2019 and decreased 0.4 percentage points to 29.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. The Second Quarter Store Sale contributed to the reduction in labor costs as a percentage of store revenues in both the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019 due to the high labor rates in the market in which the sold stores operated. The reduction in labor costs as a percentage of store revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 was partially offset by an increase in average labor rates in our remaining Company-owned store markets. Supply Chain Operating Margin Third Quarter Third Quarter Three Fiscal Three Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 Revenues $ 485.1 100.0 % $ 445.1 100.0 % $ 1,424.8 100.0 % $ 1,326.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 433.0 89.2 % 397.7 89.3 % 1,265.7 88.8 % 1,184.0 89.3 % Supply chain operating margin $ 52.2 10.8 % $ 47.4 10.7 % $ 159.1 11.2 % $ 142.1 10.7 % The supply chain operating margin increased $4.8 million, or 10.0%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $17.0 million, or 12.0%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.1 percentage points in the third quarter of 2019. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to procurement savings, offset in part by higher labor costs. 19 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $3.3 million, or 4.2%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $11.5 million, or 4.6%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. A pre-tax gain of $5.9 million recognized from the sale of 12 Company-owned stores in the third quarter of 2018 resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior year. Lower advertising expenses, resulting primarily from the Second Quarter Store Sale, partially offset these increases. A $2.4 million pre-tax loss related to the Second Quarter Store Sale and continued investments in technological initiatives and other areas also contributed to the increase in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $7.0 million, or 8.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $21.5 million, or 8.8%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $0.4 million, or 1.2%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $2.2 million, or 2.2%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. The increase in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance, primarily due to higher average borrowings resulting from the 2018 Recapitalization and outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. A higher weighted average borrowing rate also contributed to higher interest expense during the three fiscal quarters of 2019. The increase in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 was partially offset by $3.3 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2018 in connection with the 2018 Recapitalization. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate was 4.1% in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2019 and was 4.1% in the third quarter of 2018 and 4.0% in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $8.7 million, or 57.5%, in the third quarter of 2019 and increased $10.2 million, or 23.3%, in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. The effective tax rate increased to 21.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and increased to 16.6% in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 as compared to 15.3% in the third quarter of 2018 and 14.9% in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. Higher pre-tax income and lower excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation contributed to higher tax expense in both the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of September 8, 2019, we had working capital of $2.3 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $177.3 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $109.5 million and advertising fund liabilities of $104.9 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $66.7 million. During the third quarter and three fiscal quarters of 2019, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our international and U.S. businesses grew store counts in the third quarter and the three fiscal quarters of 2019. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of September 8, 2019. 20 Table of Contents Based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of September 8, 2019, we had approximately $140.9 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $36.2 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $177.3 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of September 8, 2019, we also held $68.7 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand. Long-Term Debt As of September 8, 2019, we had approximately $3.44 billion of long-term debt, of which $35.9 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $8.8 million in the remainder of 2019, $35.3 million in each of 2020 and 2021, $888.0 million in 2022, $26.3 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.14 billion in 2025, $14.0 million in 2026 and $1.27 billion in 2027. As of September 8, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and $126.9 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $48.1 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. Share Repurchase Programs Our share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess cash flows. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of the Company’s common stock. During the third quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 384,338 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $93.7 million, or an average price of $243.79 per share. During the three fiscal quarters of 2019, we repurchased and retired 430,182 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $105.1 million, or an average price of $244.43 per share. As of September 8, 2019, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $53.6 million. During the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased and retired 397,490 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $109.1 million, or an average price of $274.53 per share. During the three fiscal quarters of 2018, we repurchased and retired 1,751,054 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program for a total of approximately $429.2 million, or an average price of $245.10 per share. Subsequent to the third quarter, on October 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock, which has no expiration date. This repurchase program replaces the remaining availability of approximately $53.6 million under the Company’s existing $750.0 million share repurchase program. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. Dividends On June 28, 2019, the Company paid a $0.65 dividend to its shareholders of record as of June 14, 2019. During the third quarter of 2019, on July 10, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 13, 2019, which was paid subsequent to the third quarter on September 30, 2019. Subsequent to the third quarter, on October 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 13, 2019 to be paid on December 27, 2019. 21 Table of Contents The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2018 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 324.6 $ 262.5 Net cash used in investing activities (3.1 ) (65.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (246.3 ) (172.1 ) Exchange rate changes 0.1 (0.2 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 75.3 $ 24.9 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $62.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $32.9 million, an increase in net income of $21.1 million and higher non-cash amounts of $8.2 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of receipts on accounts receivable and timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2019 as compared to 2018 and was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted in 2019 as compared to 2018 due to higher spending of fund assets. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $3.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. We used $42.7 million of cash for capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). This use of cash was partially offset by maturities of advertising fund investments, restricted of $30.2 million and proceeds from the sale of assets of $9.7 million, which primarily related to the Second Quarter Store Sale. Cash used in investing activities was $65.4 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2018, which consisted primarily of $65.1 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in supply chain centers, technological initiatives and U.S. Company-owned stores) and purchases of restricted advertising fund investments of $50.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by maturities of restricted advertising fund investments of $44.0 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $246.3 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily related to purchases of common stock of $105.1 million under our Board of Directors-approved share repurchase program, repayments of long-term debt of $91.9 million (of which $65.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes), dividend payments to our shareholders of $53.6 million and tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $5.8 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.1 million. Cash used in financing activities was $172.1 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2018. We issued $825.0 million of debt in connection with our 2018 Recapitalization and borrowed $80.0 million under our variable funding notes. However, these increases in cash were offset by repayments of long-term debt of $595.1 million (of which $490.0 million was an optional prepayment on our 2015 five-year fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2018 Recapitalization and $80.0 million related to the repayment of the borrowings under our variable funding notes), purchases of common stock of $429.2 million, dividend payments to our shareholders of $46.7 million, and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2018 Recapitalization of $8.2 million. We also received proceeds of $9.0 million from the exercise of stock options and made $6.8 million in tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting. 22 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at September 8, 2019, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of September 8, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.7% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2019, 6.4% of our total revenues in the third quarter of 2018 and 6.6% of our total revenues in the three fiscal quarters of 2019 and 2018 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange rate risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $14.4 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey D. Lawrence, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Lawrence concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended September 8, 2019, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. As previously disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K, on February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned a $9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed an appeal. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. c.

(2) As previously disclosed, on February 14, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. As of September 8, 2019, the Company had approximately $53.6 million remaining for future share repurchases under this program. On October 4, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s common stock, which has no expiration date. This repurchase program replaces the remaining availability of approximately $53.6 million under the Company’s existing $750.0 million share repurchase program. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended June 16, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019. Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for leases below. Refer to Note 7 for additional information related to the Company’s lease arrangements and Note 11 for the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The majority of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, which are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date for leases exceeding 12 months. Minimum lease payments include only the fixed lease component of the agreement, as well as any variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate for each lease using a portfolio approach based on the respective weighted average term of the agreements. This estimation considers the market rates of the Company’s outstanding collateralized borrowings and interpolations of rates outside of the terms of the outstanding borrowings, including comparisons to comparable borrowings of similarly-rated companies with longer term borrowings. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense. Amortization expense for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense, while interest expense for finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components and short-term rentals (leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred. 7 Table of Contents 2.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The Company had $ 65.0 million outstanding under its variable funding notes at December 30, 2018. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are a variable rate loan. The fair value of this loan approximated book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. 6.

The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $ 18.2 million and $ 2.4 million as of June 16, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. The Company does not believe these arrangements have or are likely to have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures or liquidity. 8 . Legal Matters On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned an $ 9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100 % liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $ 8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed post-judgment motions with the ultimate intention of filing another appeal of the verdict, if necessary. 9. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 4.8 million at June 16, 2019 and $ 3.8 million at December 30, 2018. 13 Table of Contents 10. Sale of Company-owned Stores During the second quarter of 2019, the Company sold 59 U.S. Company-owned stores to certain of its existing U.S. franchisees for proceeds of $ 9.7 million, of which $ 8.1 million was received in cash during the quarter. The remaining $ 1.6 million was included in short-term notes receivable as of June 16, 2019. In connection with the sale of the stores, the Company recorded a $ 2.4 million pre-tax loss on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, which included a $ 1.4 million reduction in goodwill. The loss was recorded in general and administrative expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of income. 11. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. On December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of ASC 842 had a material impact on the Company’s assets and liabilities due to the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the optional practical expedient to retain its current classification of leases, and accordingly, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 7 for additional disclosure related to the Company’s lease arrangements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 for the adoption of ASC 842 were as follows: Balance at December 30, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASC 842 Balance at December 31, 2018 Assets Current assets: Prepaid expenses and other $ 25,710 $ ( 35 ) $ 25,675 Property, plant and equipment: Construction in progress 31,822 ( 1,904 ) 29,918 Other assets: Operating lease right-of-use assets — 218,860 218,860 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Current liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 32,033 32,033 Other accrued liabilities 55,001 ( 136 ) 54,865 Long-term liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 194,736 194,736 Other accrued liabilities 40,807 ( 9,712 ) 31,095 On December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment of $ 226.8 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The operating lease right-of-use assets recorded on the date of adoption were also net of a $ 7.9 million reclassification of other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses representing previously deferred (prepaid) rent and lease incentives. The Company also derecognized $ 1.9 million of construction in progress and other long-term accrued liabilities associated with a new building that will be leased to the Company upon completion in 2019. This lease was previously accounted for as a build-to-suit arrangement under prior lease accounting guidance. 14 Table of Contents Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standards. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40) In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract (“ASU 2018-15”), which aligns the accounting for implementation costs of a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract with the guidance on capitalizing costs associated with developing or obtaining internal-use software. ASU 2018-15 also requires companies to amortize these implementation costs over the life of the service contract in the same line in the statement of income as the fees associated with the hosting service. ASU 2018-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 15 Table of Contents Item 2.

Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 16,300 locations in over 85 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. Everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza ® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment.

The same store sales growth for these stores is reflected in U.S. franchise stores in the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019, we experienced global retail sales growth. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth remained positive but was pressured by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete. 16 Table of Contents We also continued our global expansion with the opening of 200 net new stores in the second quarter of 2019, bringing our year-to-date total to 400. We opened 158 net new stores internationally and 42 net new stores in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2019. Overall, we believe this global store growth, along with our strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives, have combined to strengthen our brand. Global retail sales, which are total worldwide retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores, increased 5.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 4.8% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were driven by an increase in worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters as well as U.S. and international same store sales growth. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates partially offset this increase, resulting from a generally stronger U.S. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete. U.S. same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms. International same store sales growth also reflected continued positive performance. Total revenues increased $32.2 million, or 4.1%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $82.8 million, or 5.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were due primarily to higher global retail sales, which resulted in higher supply chain and global franchise revenues. The increases in international franchise revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These increases in revenues were also partially offset by lower U.S. Company-owned store revenues resulting from the sale of 59 Company-owned stores to certain of our existing U.S. franchisees during the second quarter of 2019 (the “Second Quarter Store Sale”). These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $12.8 million, or 10.1%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $22.8 million, or 8.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from U.S. and international franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. Higher investments in technological initiatives and other areas and a $2.4 million pre-tax loss related to the Second Quarter Store Sale partially offset these increases. Income from operations was also negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Net income increased $15.0 million, or 19.3%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $18.8 million, or 11.3%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, driven by higher income from operations and lower tax expense resulting primarily from higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. Net income further benefited from lower interest expense in the second quarter of 2019 resulting from $3.3 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2018 in connection with our recapitalization transaction completed on April 24, 2018 (the “2018 Recapitalization”). The increase in net income in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting primarily from a higher average debt balance and a higher weighted average borrowing rate following the 2018 Recapitalization.

Company-owned store, franchised store and supply chain revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may also vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell.

These decreases in revenues were partially offset by higher same store sales. Company-owned same store sales increased 2.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 2.6% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Company-owned same store sales increased 5.1% in the second quarter of 2018 and increased 5.8% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $8.2 million, or 9.4%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $15.4 million, or 8.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the Second Quarter Store Sale. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 3.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 7.0% in the second quarter of 2018 and increased 7.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $7.6 million, or 9.4%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $14.5 million, or 8.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period due to net store growth and, to a lesser extent, the Second Quarter Store Sale. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 3.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 3.5% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 7.0% in the second quarter of 2018 and increased 7.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. Supply Chain Revenues Second Quarter Second Quarter Two Fiscal Two Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 U.S. supply chain $ 424.6 90.8 % $ 399.7 90.7 % $ 853.3 90.8 % $ 798.6 90.6 % International supply chain 43.0 9.2 % 41.2 9.3 % 86.4 9.2 % 82.4 9.4 % Total supply chain $ 467.6 100.0 % $ 440.9 100.0 % $ 939.7 100.0 % $ 881.0 100.0 % U.S. Supply Chain U.S. supply chain revenues increased $24.9 million, or 6.2%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $54.7 million, or 6.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders resulting from an increase in the average number of U.S. franchise stores open during the period and an increase in market basket pricing. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 2.3% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 2.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, which resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. supply chain revenues of $5.6 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $11.8 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. International Supply Chain Revenues from international supply chain operations increased $1.8 million, or 4.4%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $4.0 million, or 4.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher volumes from increased orders and an increase in market basket pricing. These increases in revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1.7 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $3.8 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $3.7 million, or 7.1%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $5.8 million, or 5.6%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These increases were due primarily to an increase in the average number of international stores open during the period and higher same store sales. These increases in revenues were partially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $3.0 million in the second quarter of 2019 and $6.6 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 2.1% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 4.0% in the second quarter of 2018 and increased 4.4% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. 18 Table of Contents Cost of Sales / Operating Margin Second Quarter Second Quarter Two Fiscal Two Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 Consolidated revenues $ 811.6 100.0 % $ 779.4 100.0 % $ 1,647.6 100.0 % $ 1,564.8 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 495.0 61.0 % 485.8 62.3 % 1,008.7 61.2 % 971.3 62.1 % Consolidated operating margin $ 316.7 39.0 % $ 293.6 37.7 % $ 639.0 38.8 % $ 593.4 37.9 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $23.1 million, or 7.9%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $45.6 million, or 7.7%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.9 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Company-owned store operating margin increased 0.9 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.1 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.7 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These changes in operating margin are more fully discussed below. U.S. Company-Owned Stores Operating Margin Second Quarter Second Quarter Two Fiscal Two Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 Revenues $ 105.0 100.0 % $ 118.8 100.0 % $ 228.5 100.0 % $ 240.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 80.4 76.5 % 92.0 77.4 % 175.9 77.0 % 185.0 77.1 % Store operating margin $ 24.6 23.5 % $ 26.8 22.6 % $ 52.5 23.0 % $ 55.0 22.9 % The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $2.2 million, or 8.1%, in the second quarter of 2019 and decreased $2.5 million, or 4.4%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to the Second Quarter Store Sale. Operating margin in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019 was also negatively impacted by higher labor costs, partially offset by higher same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin increased 0.9 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.1 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These changes in operating margin as a percentage of revenues are discussed in more detail below. • Food costs decreased 0.6 percentage points to 26.9% in the second quarter of 2019 and decreased 0.4 percentage points to 27.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales and improvements in efficiency. These decreases were partially offset by higher food prices. • Labor costs decreased 0.6 percentage points to 29.4% in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.4 percentage points to 30.2% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. The Second Quarter Store Sale contributed to the reduction in labor costs as a percentage of store revenues in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019 due to the high labor rates in the market in which the sold stores operated. These decreases were partially offset in the second quarter of 2019 and fully offset in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 by an increase in average labor rates in our remaining Company-owned store markets. Supply Chain Operating Margin Second Quarter Second Quarter Two Fiscal Two Fiscal of 2019 of 2018 Quarters of 2019 Quarters of 2018 Revenues $ 467.6 100.0 % $ 440.9 100.0 % $ 939.7 100.0 % $ 881.0 100.0 % Cost of sales 414.6 88.7 % 393.8 89.3 % 832.7 88.6 % 786.3 89.3 % Supply chain operating margin $ 53.0 11.3 % $ 47.1 10.7 % $ 106.9 11.4 % $ 94.7 10.7 % The supply chain operating margin increased $5.9 million, or 12.5%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $12.2 million, or 13.0%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the second quarter of 2019 and increased 0.7 percentage points in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due primarily to procurement savings and lower insurance expense, offset in part by higher labor costs. 19 Table of Contents General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $2.7 million, or 3.2%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $8.2 million, or 4.8%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and other areas. A $2.4 million pre-tax loss related to the Second Quarter Store Sale also contributed to the increases. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $7.6 million, or 9.4%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $14.5 million, or 8.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net decreased $2.0 million, or 5.7%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $2.5 million, or 3.9%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. The decrease in interest expense, net in the second quarter of 2019 resulted from $3.3 million of incremental interest expense recorded in the second quarter of 2018 in connection with the 2018 Recapitalization. This decrease was partially offset in the second quarter of 2019 and more than offset in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 by a higher weighted average debt balance, driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from the 2018 Recapitalization and outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. A higher weighted average borrowing rate also contributed to higher interest expense during the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate increased to 4.1% in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019, from 4.0% in the second quarter of 2018 and 3.9% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018, resulting from the higher interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2019 as compared to the same periods in 2018. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes decreased $0.2 million, or 1.2%, in the second quarter of 2019 and increased $1.5 million, or 5.2%, in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Higher pre-tax income contributed to higher tax expense in both the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019, but these increases were fully offset in the second quarter of 2019 and partially offset in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 by higher excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation. The effective tax rate decreased to 12.9% in the second quarter of 2019 and decreased to 14.0% in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 as compared to 15.1% in the second quarter of 2018 and 14.7% in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of June 16, 2019, we had working capital of $73.5 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $152.7 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $117.7 million and advertising fund liabilities of $113.4 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $108.3 million. During the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2019, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable periods in the prior year. Additionally, our international and U.S. businesses grew store counts in the second quarter and the two fiscal quarters of 2019. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of June 16, 2019. Based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 20 Table of Contents Restricted Cash As of June 16, 2019, we had approximately $115.9 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $36.6 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $152.7 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of June 16, 2019, we also held $61.3 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand. Long-Term Debt As of June 16, 2019, we had approximately $3.45 billion of long-term debt, of which $35.9 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $17.6 million in the remainder of 2019, $35.3 million in each of 2020 and 2021, $888.0 million in 2022, $26.3 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.14 billion in 2025, $14.0 million in 2026 and $1.27 billion in 2027. As of June 16, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and $126.9 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $48.1 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. Share Repurchase Programs Our open market share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess cash flows. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of the Company’s common stock. During the second quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 12,295 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program for a total of approximately $3.3 million, or an average price of $269.14 per share. During the two fiscal quarters of 2019, we repurchased and retired 45,844 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program for a total of approximately $11.5 million, or an average price of $249.82 per share. As of June 16, 2019, we had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $147.3 million. During the second quarter of 2018, we repurchased and retired 905,556 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program for a total of approximately $219.0 million, or an average price of $241.82 per share. During the two fiscal quarters of 2018, we repurchased and retired 1,353,564 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program for a total of approximately $320.1 million, or an average price of $236.46 per share. Dividends On March 29, 2019, the Company paid a $0.65 dividend to its shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, on April 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 14, 2019, which was paid on June 28, 2019. Subsequent to the second quarter, on July 10, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of September 13, 2019 to be paid on September 30, 2019. The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) Two Fiscal Quarters of 2019 Two Fiscal Quarters of 2018 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 201.6 $ 154.7 Net cash used in investing activities (2.5 ) (43.8 ) Net cash used in financing activities (114.3 ) (30.1 ) Exchange rate changes 0.1 (0.1 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 84.8 $ 80.7 Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $46.9 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019 due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $26.1 million, an increase in net income of $18.8 million and higher non-cash amounts of $2.0 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of receipts on accounts receivable and timing of payments on accounts payable during 2019 as compared to 2018 and was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted in 2019 as compared to 2018. 21 Table of Contents Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $2.5 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, which consisted primarily of $25.7 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). This use of cash was partially offset by maturities of advertising fund investments, restricted of $15.2 million and proceeds from the sale of assets of $8.2 million, which primarily related to the Second Quarter Store Sale. Cash used in investing activities was $43.8 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2018, which consisted primarily of $37.3 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, supply chain centers and Company-owned stores) and purchases of restricted advertising fund investments of $35.2 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by maturities of restricted advertising fund investments of $29.0 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $114.3 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, primarily related to repayments of long-term debt of $82.9 million (of which $65.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes), dividend payments to our shareholders of $26.7 million, purchases of common stock of $11.5 million under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program and tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting of $2.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $9.3 million. Cash used in financing activities was $30.1 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2018. We issued $825.0 million of debt in connection with our 2018 Recapitalization and borrowed $80.0 million under our variable funding notes. However, these increases in cash were offset by repayments of long-term debt of $586.1 million (of which $490.0 million was an optional prepayment on our 2015 five-year fixed rate notes using a portion of the proceeds received from the 2018 Recapitalization and $80.0 million related to the repayment of the borrowings under our variable funding notes), purchases of common stock of $320.1 million, dividend payments to our shareholders of $23.5 million, and cash paid for financing costs related to our 2018 Recapitalization of $8.2 million. We also made $2.3 million in tax payments for restricted stock upon vesting and received proceeds of $5.2 million from the exercise of stock options. 22 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at June 16, 2019, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of June 16, 2019, we had no outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.8% of our total revenues in the second quarter of 2019, approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in the two fiscal quarters of 2019, and approximately 6.6% of our total revenues in both the second quarter and two fiscal quarters of 2018 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange rate risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $9.6 million in the two fiscal quarters of 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey D. Lawrence, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Lawrence concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended June 16, 2019, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 24 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. As previously disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K, on February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The case went to trial in 2016 and the Company was found liable, but the verdict was reversed by the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeals in May 2018 and was remanded to the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida for a new trial. The case was tried again in June 2019 and the jury returned an $9.0 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 100% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.0 million). The Company continues to deny liability and has filed post-judgment motions with the ultimate intention of filing another appeal of the verdict, if necessary. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Basis of Presentation and Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 included in the Company’s 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019 (the “2018 Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement have been included. Operating results for the fiscal quarter ended March 24, 2019 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 29, 2019. Updates to Significant Accounting Policies The Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (“ASC 842”) in the first quarter of 2019. As a result, the Company updated its significant accounting policies for leases below. Refer to Note 11 for additional information related to the Company’s lease arrangements and Note 15 for the impact of the adoption of ASC 842 on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Leases The Company leases certain retail store and supply chain center locations, supply chain vehicles and its corporate headquarters. The Company determines whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception. The majority of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases, which are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date for leases exceeding 12 months. Minimum lease payments include only the fixed lease component of the agreement, as well as any variable rate payments that depend on an index, initially measured using the index at the lease commencement date. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate for each lease using a portfolio approach based on the respective weighted average term of the agreements. This estimation considers the market rates of the Company’s outstanding collateralized borrowings and interpolations of rates outside of the terms of the outstanding borrowings, including comparisons to comparable borrowings of similarly-rated companies with longer term borrowings. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense. Amortization expense for finance leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales or general and administrative expense, while interest expense for finance leases is recognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease payments that do not depend on a rate or index, payments associated with non-lease components and short-term rentals (leases with terms less than 12 months) are expensed as incurred. 7 2.

Fair Value Measurements Fair value measurements enable the reader of the financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The Company classifies and discloses assets and liabilities carried at fair value in one of the following three categories: Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data. The fair values of the Company’s cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The following tables summarize the carrying amounts and fair values of certain assets at March 24, 2019 and December 30, 2018: At March 24, 2019 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 48,467 $ 48,467 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 90,014 90,014 — — Investments in marketable securities 10,187 10,187 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 22,847 22,847 — — Advertising fund investments, restricted 50,152 50,152 — — At December 30, 2018 Fair Value Estimated Using Carrying Amount Level 1 Inputs Level 2 Inputs Level 3 Inputs Cash equivalents $ 11,877 $ 11,877 $ — $ — Restricted cash equivalents 112,272 112,272 — — Investments in marketable securities 8,718 8,718 — — Advertising fund cash equivalents, restricted 31,547 31,547 — — Advertising fund investments, restricted 50,152 50,152 — — Management estimated the approximate fair values of the 2015 fixed rate notes, the 2017 fixed and floating rate notes and the 2018 fixed rate notes as follows: March 24, 2019 December 30, 2018 Principal Amount Fair Value Principal Amount Fair Value 2015 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes $ 778,000 $ 804,452 $ 780,000 $ 783,120 2017 Five-Year Fixed Rate Notes 591,000 582,726 592,500 575,910 2017 Ten-Year Fixed Rate Notes 985,000 991,895 987,500 956,888 2017 Five-Year Floating Rate Notes 295,500 294,318 296,250 295,065 2018 7.5-Year Fixed Rate Notes 421,813 427,297 422,875 416,955 2018 9.25-Year Fixed Rate Notes 397,000 404,940 398,000 396,010 At March 24 , 2019 , the Company had $ 25.0 million outstanding under its variable funding notes, which is a variable rate loan. The fair value of this loan approximates book value based on the borrowing rates currently available for variable rate loans obtained from third party lending institutions. This fair value represents a Level 2 measurement. The Company had $ 65.0 million outstanding under its variable funding notes at December 30 , 2018 . 10 The fixed and floating rate notes are classified as Level 2 measurements, as the Company estimates the fair value amount by using available market information. The Company obtained quotes from two separate brokerage firms that are knowledgeable about the Company’s fixed and floating rate notes and, at times, trade these notes. The Company also performed its own internal analysis based on the information gathered from public markets, including information on notes that are similar to those of the Company. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to estimate fair value. Accordingly, the fair value estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amount that the Company or the debtholders could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair values stated above. 9.

The Company has also entered into an additional finance lease for a supply chain center that had not yet commenced with estimated future minimum rental commitments of approximately $ 28.7 million. These leases are expected to commence in 2019 with lease terms of up to 15 years. These undiscounted amounts are not included in the tables above.

The maximum amount of potential future payments under these guarantees is $ 2.3 million and $ 2.4 million as of March 24, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively. We believe that none of these arrangements has or is likely to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, revenues or expenses, capital expenditures or liquidity. 12. Legal Matters On February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The jury returned a $ 10.1 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 90 % liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $ 8.9 million). In the second quarter of 2016, the trial court ruled on all post-judgment motions and entered the judgment. The Company denies liability and in the third quarter of 2016 filed an appeal of the verdict on a variety of grounds. On May 11, 2018, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial based on the plaintiff’s improper closing argument. The Company continues to deny liability in this matter. 13. Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information The Company had non-cash investing activities related to accruals for capital expenditures of $ 2.6 million at March 24, 2019 and $ 3.8 million at December 30, 2018. 14. Sale of Company-owned Stores Subsequent to the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into agreements to sell 59 U.S. Company-owned stores to certain of its existing franchisees. 13 15. New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Standard Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) which requires a lessee to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months. On December 31, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of ASC 842 had a material impact on the Company’s assets and liabilities due to the recognition of operating lease right-of- use assets and lease liabilities on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company elected the optional practical expedient to retain its current classification of leases, and accordingly, the adoption of ASC 842 did not have a material effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated statement of income and condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 11 for additional disclosure related to the Company’s lease arrangements. The effects of the changes made to the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 for the adoption of ASC 842 were as follows: Balance at December 30, 2018 Adjustments Due to ASC 842 Balance at December 31, 2018 Assets Current assets: Prepaid expenses and other $ 25,710 $ ( 35 ) $ 25,675 Property, plant and equipment: Construction in progress 31,822 ( 1,904 ) 29,918 Other assets: Operating lease right-of-use assets — 218,860 218,860 Liabilities and stockholders’ deficit Current liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 32,033 32,033 Other accrued liabilities 55,001 ( 136 ) 54,865 Long-term liabilities: Operating lease liabilities — 194,736 194,736 Other accrued liabilities 40,807 ( 9,712 ) 31,095 On December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an adjustment of $ 226.8 million for operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities. The operating lease right-of-use assets recorded on the date of adoption were also net of a $ 7.9 million reclassification of other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses representing previously deferred (prepaid) rent and lease incentives. The Company also derecognized $ 1.9 million of construction in progress and other long-term accrued liabilities associated with a new building that will be leased to the Company upon completion in 2019. This lease was previously accounted for as a build-to-suit arrangement under prior lease accounting guidance. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted The Company has considered all new accounting standards issued by the FASB. The Company has not yet completed its assessment of the following standard. ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 requires companies to measure credit losses utilizing a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires a consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this standard but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 14 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (Unaudited; tabular amounts in millions, except percentages and store data) The 2019 and 2018 first quarters referenced herein represent the twelve-week periods ended March 24, 2019 and March 25, 2018. Overview Domino’s is the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, with more than 16,100 locations in over 85 markets. Founded in 1960, our roots are in convenient pizza delivery, while a significant amount of our sales also come from carryout customers. Domino’s generates revenues and earnings by charging royalties and fees to our independent franchisees. The Company also generates revenues and earnings by selling food, equipment and supplies to franchisees primarily in the U.S. and Canada, and by operating a number of our own stores in the U.S. Franchisees profit by selling pizza and other complementary items to their local customers. In our international markets, we generally grant geographical rights to the Domino’s Pizza ® brand to master franchisees. These master franchisees are charged with developing their geographical area, and they can profit by sub-franchising and selling ingredients and equipment to those sub-franchisees, as well as by running pizza stores directly. Everyone in the system can benefit, including the end consumer, who can feed their family Domino’s menu items conveniently and economically. Our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our franchise and Company-owned stores. Changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts. We monitor both of these metrics very closely, as they directly impact our revenues and profits, and we strive to consistently increase both metrics. Retail sales drive royalty payments from franchisees, as well as Company-owned store and supply chain revenues. Retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the Domino’s Pizza ® brand, the results of our extensive advertising through various media channels, the impact of technological innovation and digital ordering, our ability to execute our strong and proven business model and the overall global economic environment. First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 Global retail sales growth +4.6 % +16.8 % Same store sales growth: U.S. Company-owned stores +2.1 % +6.4 % U.S. franchise stores +4.1 % +8.4 % U.S. stores +3.9 % +8.3 % International stores (excluding foreign currency impact) +1.8 % +5.0 % Store counts (at end of period): U.S. Company-owned stores 392 397 U.S. franchise stores 5,511 5,252 U.S. stores 5,903 5,649 International stores 10,211 9,317 Total stores 16,114 14,966 Income statement data: Total revenues $ 836.0 100.0 % $ 785.4 100.0 % Cost of sales 513.7 61.4 % 485.5 61.8 % General and administrative 89.7 10.7 % 84.2 10.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 89.1 10.7 % 82.2 10.5 % Income from operations 143.5 17.2 % 133.5 17.0 % Interest expense, net (34.4 ) (4.1 )% (29.8 ) (3.8 )% Income before provision for income taxes 109.1 13.1 % 103.7 13.2 % Provision for income taxes 16.5 2.0 % 14.8 1.9 % Net income $ 92.7 11.1 % $ 88.8 11.3 % During the first quarter of 2019, we experienced healthy global retail sales growth. Our U.S. and international same store sales growth remained positive but was pressured by our current strategy to increase store concentration in certain markets where we compete. We also continued our global expansion with the opening of 200 net new stores in the first quarter of 2019. We opened 173 net new stores internationally and 27 net new stores in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2019. Overall, we believe this global store growth, along with our strong sales, emphasis on technology, operations, and marketing initiatives have combined to strengthen our brand. 15 Global retail sales, which are total retail sales at franchise and Company-owned stores worldwide, increased 4.6% in the first quarter of 2019. This increase was driven by an increase in worldwide store counts during the trailing four quarters as well as U.S. and international same store sales growth. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates partially offset this increase, resulting from a generally stronger U.S. dollar when compared to the currencies in the international markets in which we compete. U.S. same store sales growth reflected the sustained positive sales trends and the continued success of our products, marketing and technology platforms. International same store sales growth also reflected continued positive performance. Total revenues increased $50.6 million, or 6.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher supply chain volumes resulting from order and store count growth, as well as higher U.S. franchise, Company-owned store and international franchise revenues resulting from store count and same store sales growth. The increase in international franchise revenues was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates. These changes in revenues are described in more detail below. Income from operations increased $10.0 million, or 7.5%, in the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by higher royalty revenues from U.S. and international franchised stores, as well as higher supply chain margins. Higher investments in technological initiatives and other strategic areas partially offset these increases in income from operations. Income from operations was also negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the first quarter of 2019. Net income increased $3.9 million, or 4.3%, in the first quarter of 2019, driven by higher income from operations, as noted above. This increase in net income was partially offset by higher interest expense resulting primarily from a higher average debt balance. Revenues First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 123.5 14.8 % $ 121.2 15.4 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 96.7 11.6 % 89.5 11.4 % Supply chain 472.1 56.4 % 440.1 56.0 % International franchise royalties and fees 54.6 6.5 % 52.4 6.7 % U.S. franchise advertising 89.1 10.7 % 82.2 10.5 % Total revenues $ 836.0 100.0 % $ 785.4 100.0 % Revenues primarily consist of retail sales from our Company-owned stores, royalties, advertising contributions and fees from our U.S. franchised stores, royalties and fees from our international franchised stores and sales of food, equipment and supplies from our supply chain centers to all of our U.S. franchised stores and certain international franchised stores. Company-owned store and franchised store revenues may vary from period to period due to changes in store count mix. Supply chain revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of fluctuations in commodity prices as well as the mix of products we sell. U.S. Stores Revenues First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 U.S. Company-owned stores $ 123.5 39.9 % $ 121.2 41.4 % U.S. franchise royalties and fees 96.7 31.3 % 89.5 30.6 % U.S. franchise advertising 89.1 28.8 % 82.2 28.0 % U.S. stores $ 309.3 100.0 % $ 292.9 100.0 % U.S. stores revenues increased $16.4 million, or 5.6%, in the first quarter of 2019, driven primarily by higher U.S. franchise revenues. These changes in U.S. stores revenues are more fully described below. U.S. Company-Owned Stores Revenues from U.S. Company-owned store operations increased $2.3 million, or 1.9%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales. Company-owned same store sales increased 2.1% in the first quarter of 2019 and 6.4% in the first quarter of 2018. U.S. Franchise Royalties and Fees Revenues from U.S. franchise royalties and fees increased $7.2 million, or 8.1%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 4.1% in the first quarter of 2019 and 8.4% in the first quarter of 2018. 16 U.S. Franchise Advertising Revenues from U.S. franchise advertising increased $6.9 million, or 8.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher same store sales and an increase in the average number of U.S. franchised stores open during the period. U.S. franchise same store sales increased 4.1% in the first quarter of 2019 and 8.4% in the first quarter of 2018. Supply Chain Revenues First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 U.S. supply chain $ 428.7 90.8 % $ 398.9 90.6 % International supply chain 43.4 9.2 % 41.2 9.4 % Total supply chain $ 472.1 100.0 % $ 440.1 100.0 % U.S. Supply Chain U.S. supply chain revenues increased $29.8 million, or 7.5%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level and store count growth and an increase in market basket pricing. Our market basket pricing to stores increased 1.8% in the first quarter of 2019, which resulted in an estimated increase in U.S. supply chain revenues of $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2019. International Supply Chain Revenues from international supply chain operations increased $2.2 million, or 5.3%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher volumes from increased order counts at the store level. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.2 million partially offset the increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2019. International Franchise Royalties and Fee Revenues Revenues from international franchise royalties and fees increased $2.2 million, or 4.1%, in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were due primarily to an increase in the average number of international stores open during the period and higher same store sales. The negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $3.7 million partially offset the increase in revenues in the first quarter of 2019. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, international franchise same store sales increased 1.8% in the first quarter of 2019 and increased 5.0% in the first quarter of 2018. Cost of Sales / Operating Margin First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 Consolidated revenues $ 836.0 100.0 % $ 785.4 100.0 % Consolidated cost of sales 513.7 61.4 % 485.5 61.8 % Consolidated operating margin $ 322.3 38.6 % $ 299.9 38.2 % Cost of sales consists primarily of Company-owned store and supply chain costs incurred to generate related revenues. Components of consolidated cost of sales primarily include food, labor, delivery and occupancy costs. Consolidated operating margin (which we define as revenues less cost of sales) increased $22.4 million, or 7.5%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher global franchise revenues and higher supply chain volumes. Franchise revenues do not have a cost of sales component, so changes in these revenues have a disproportionate effect on the operating margin. As a percentage of revenues, the consolidated operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019. Company-owned store operating margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019 and supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019. These changes in margin are more fully discussed below. U.S. Company-Owned Stores Operating Margin First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 Revenues $ 123.5 100.0 % $ 121.2 100.0 % Cost of sales 95.5 77.4 % 93.0 76.8 % Store operating margin $ 27.9 22.6 % $ 28.1 23.2 % 17 The U.S. Company-owned store operating margin (which does not include certain store-level costs such as royalties and advertising) decreased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher labor costs, partially offset by higher same store sales. As a percentage of store revenues, the store operating margin decreased 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019, as discussed in more detail below. • Food costs decreased 0.1 percentage points to 27.1% in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to the leveraging of higher same store sales offset in part by higher food prices. • Labor costs increased 1.1 percentage points to 30.8% in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to an increase in labor rates in certain markets. Supply Chain Operating Margin First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 Revenues $ 472.1 100.0 % $ 440.1 100.0 % Cost of sales 418.1 88.6 % 392.5 89.2 % Supply chain operating margin $ 54.0 11.4 % $ 47.6 10.8 % The supply chain operating margin increased $6.4 million, or 13.4%, in the first quarter of 2019, primarily driven by higher volumes from increased store orders. As a percentage of supply chain revenues, the supply chain operating margin increased 0.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to procurement savings, offset in part by higher labor costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses increased $5.5 million, or 6.5%, in the first quarter of 2019, driven by continued investments in technological initiatives and other areas. U.S. Franchise Advertising Expenses U.S. franchise advertising expenses increased $6.9 million, or 8.4%, in the first quarter of 2019 due to higher U.S. franchise advertising revenues. U.S. franchise advertising costs are accrued and expensed when the related U.S. franchise advertising revenues are recognized, as our consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund is obligated to expend such revenues on advertising and these revenues cannot be used for general corporate purposes. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net increased $4.6 million, or 15.3%, in the first quarter of 2019 driven primarily by higher average borrowings resulting from our recapitalization transaction completed on April 24, 2018 (“2018 Recapitalization”) and the outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes during the quarter. A higher weighted average borrowing rate also contributed to the increase in interest expense, net. The Company’s weighted average borrowing rate increased to 4.1% in the first quarter of 2019, from 3.9% in the first quarter of 2018, resulting from the higher interest rates on the debt outstanding in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes increased $1.7 million, or 11.1%, in the first quarter of 2019 due primarily to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate increased to 15.1% during the first quarter of 2019 as compared to 14.3% in the first quarter of 2018. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or negative working capital, primarily because our receivable collection periods and inventory turn rates are faster than the normal payment terms on our current liabilities. We generally collect our receivables within three weeks from the date of the related sale, and we generally experience 35 to 45 inventory turns per year. In addition, our sales are not typically seasonal, which further limits our working capital requirements. The use of our ongoing cash flows from operations to service our debt obligations, invest in our business, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock reduces our working capital amounts. As of March 24, 2019, we had working capital of $23.4 million, excluding restricted cash and cash equivalents of $150.1 million, advertising fund assets, restricted, of $98.1 million and advertising fund liabilities of $93.0 million. Working capital includes total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $83.1 million. 18 During the first quarter of 2019, we experienced increases in both U.S. and international same store sales versus the comparable period in the prior year. Additionally, our international and U.S. businesses grew store counts in the first quarter of 2019. These factors contributed to our continued ability to generate positive operating cash flows. We expect to continue to use our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, excess cash from our recapitalization transactions and available borrowings under our variable funding notes to, among other things, fund working capital requirements, invest in our core business, service our indebtedness, pay dividends and repurchase our common stock. We did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures as of March 24, 2019. Based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from operations, our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our variable funding note facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. Our ability to continue to fund these items and continue to reduce debt could be adversely affected by the occurrence of any of the events described under “Risk Factors” in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the variable funding notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend or refinance our fixed and floating rate notes and to service, extend or refinance our variable funding notes will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Restricted Cash As of March 24, 2019, we had approximately $113.0 million of restricted cash held for future principal and interest payments and other working capital requirements of our asset-backed securitization structure, $36.9 million of restricted cash held in a three-month interest reserve as required by the related debt agreements and $0.2 million of other restricted cash for a total of $150.1 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of March 24, 2019, we also held $34.3 million of advertising fund restricted cash and cash equivalents, which can only be used for activities that promote the Domino’s Pizza brand. Long-Term Debt As of March 24, 2019, we had approximately $3.48 billion of long-term debt, of which $35.9 million was classified as a current liability. Our fixed and floating rate notes from the recapitalizations we completed in 2018, 2017 and 2015 have original scheduled principal payments of $26.4 million in the remainder of 2019, $35.3 million in each of 2020 and 2021, $888.0 million in 2022, $26.3 million in each of 2023 and 2024, $1.14 billion in 2025, $14.0 million in 2026 and $1.27 billion in 2027. As of March 24, 2019, we had $25.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our variable funding notes and $101.9 million available for borrowing, net of letters of credit issued of $48.1 million. The letters of credit are primarily related to our casualty insurance programs and supply chain center leases. Borrowings under the variable funding notes are available to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and, subject to other limitations, other general corporate purposes including dividend payments and share repurchases. Share Repurchase Programs Our open market share repurchase programs have historically been funded by excess cash flows. On February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of the Company’s common stock. During the first quarter of 2019, we repurchased and retired 33,549 shares of our common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program for a total of approximately $8.1 million, or an average price of $242.74 per share. As of March 24, 2019, the Company had a total remaining authorized amount for share repurchases of approximately $150.6 million. During the first quarter of 2018, we repurchased and retired 448,008 shares for approximately $101.1 million, or an average price of $225.63 per share. Dividends On February 20, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of March 15, 2019 which was paid on March 29, 2019. We had approximately $27.2 million accrued for common stock dividends at March 24, 2019. Subsequent to the first quarter, on April 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.65 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of June 14, 2019 to be paid on June 28, 2019. 19 The following table illustrates the main components of our cash flows: (In millions) First Quarter of 2019 First Quarter of 2018 Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 97.0 $ 83.7 Net cash used in investing activities (12.0 ) (10.1 ) Net cash used in financing activities (55.1 ) (107.8 ) Exchange rate changes 0.1 — Change in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents $ 30.0 $ (34.2 ) Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities increased $13.3 million in the first quarter of 2019 due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.5 million, an increase in net income of $3.9 million and higher non-cash amounts of $2.0 million. The positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to the timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities during 2019 as compared to 2018 and was partially offset by the negative impact of changes in advertising fund assets and liabilities, restricted in 2019 as compared to 2018. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2019, which consisted primarily of $12.2 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives and supply chain centers). Cash used in investing activities was $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, which consisted primarily of $13.6 million of capital expenditures (driven primarily by investments in technological initiatives, Company-owned stores and supply chain centers) partially offset by maturities of restricted advertising fund investments of $4.0 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $55.1 million in the first quarter of 2019, primarily related to repayments of long-term debt of $49.0 million (of which $40.0 million related to the repayment of borrowings under our variable funding notes) and the repurchase of approximately $8.1 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program. Cash used in financing activities was $107.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $101.1 million in common stock under our Board of Directors-approved open market share repurchase program. We also used $8.1 million to make payments on our long-term debt obligations during the first quarter of 2018. 20 Forward-Looking Statements This filing contains various forward-looking statements about the Company within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the “Act”) that are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to: our substantial increased indebtedness as a result of our recapitalization transactions and our ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance or renegotiate key terms of that indebtedness in the future; the impact a downgrade in our credit rating may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations; our future financial performance and our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness; the effectiveness of our advertising, operations and promotional initiatives; the strength of our brand, including our ability to compete in the U.S. and internationally in our intensely competitive industry; the impact of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies on our business, brand and reputation; new product, digital ordering and concept developments by us, and other food-industry competitors; our ability to maintain good relationships with our franchisees and their ongoing level of profitability; our ability to successfully implement cost-saving strategies; our ability and that of our franchisees to successfully operate in the current and future credit environment; changes in the level of consumer spending given general economic conditions, including interest rates, energy prices and consumer confidence; our ability and that of our franchisees to open new restaurants and keep existing restaurants in operation; changes in operating expenses resulting from changes in prices of food (particularly cheese), fuel and other commodity costs, labor, utilities, insurance, employee benefits and other operating costs; the impact that widespread illness or general health concerns, severe weather conditions and natural disasters may have on our business and the economies of the countries where we operate; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to retain or replace our executive officers and other key members of management and our ability to adequately staff our stores and supply chain centers with qualified personnel; our ability to find and/or retain suitable real estate for our stores and supply chain centers; changes in government legislation and regulations, including changes in laws and regulations regarding information privacy and consumer protection; adverse legal judgments or settlements; food-borne illness or contamination of products; data breaches, power loss, technological failures, user error or other cyber risks; the effect of war, terrorism or catastrophic events; our ability to pay dividends and repurchase shares; changes in consumer preferences, spending and traffic patterns and demographic trends; changes in accounting policies; and adequacy of our insurance coverage. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release might not occur. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release and should be evaluated with an understanding of their inherent uncertainty. Except as required under federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or other applicable law, we will not undertake and specifically disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date of this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements included in this press release or that may be made elsewhere from time to time by, or on behalf of, us. All forward-looking statements attributable to us are expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. 21 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Market Risk We do not engage in speculative transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In connection with the recapitalizations of our business, we issued fixed and floating rate notes and entered into variable funding notes and, at March 24, 2019, we are exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our floating rate notes and variable funding notes. As of March 24, 2019, we had $25.0 million outstanding under our variable funding notes. Our floating rate notes and our variable funding notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates based on LIBOR. There is currently uncertainty around whether LIBOR will continue to exist after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our loan documents and we cannot predict what alternative index would be negotiated with our lenders. As a result, our interest expense could increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. Our fixed rate debt exposes the Company to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. During the normal course of business, we purchase cheese and certain other food products that are affected by changes in commodity prices and, as a result, we are subject to volatility in our food costs. We may periodically enter into financial instruments to manage this risk. We do not engage in speculative transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. In instances when we use fixed pricing agreements with our suppliers, these agreements cover our physical commodity needs, are not net-settled and are accounted for as normal purchases. We have exposure to various foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenues generated by our operations outside the U.S., which can adversely impact our net income and cash flows. Approximately 6.5% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2019 and approximately 6.7% of our total revenues in the first quarter of 2018 were derived from our international franchise segment, a majority of which were denominated in foreign currencies. We also operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars. We do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency exchange risk. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates for our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on royalty revenues of approximately $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2019. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Management, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Richard E. Allison, Jr., and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Jeffrey D. Lawrence, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Allison and Mr. Lawrence concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. During the quarterly period ended March 24, 2019, there were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 22 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. We are a party to lawsuits, revenue agent reviews by taxing authorities and administrative proceedings in the ordinary course of business which include, without limitation, workers’ compensation, general liability, automobile and franchisee claims. We are also subject to suits related to employment practices as well as intellectual property, including patents. As previously disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2019, on February 14, 2011, Domino’s Pizza LLC was named as a defendant in a lawsuit along with Fischler Enterprises of C.F., Inc., a franchisee, and Jeffrey S. Kidd, the franchisee’s delivery driver, filed by Yvonne Wiederhold, the plaintiff, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Richard E. Wiederhold, deceased. The case involved a traffic accident in which the franchisee’s delivery driver is alleged to have caused an accident involving a vehicle driven by Richard Wiederhold. Mr. Wiederhold sustained spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia and passed away several months after the accident. The jury returned a $10.1 million judgment for the plaintiff where the Company and Mr. Kidd were found to be 90% liable (after certain offsets and other deductions the final verdict was $8.9 million). In the second quarter of 2016, the trial court ruled on all post-judgment motions and entered the judgment. The Company denies liability and in the third quarter of 2016 filed an appeal of the verdict on a variety of grounds. On May 11, 2018, the court of appeals reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial based on the plaintiff’s improper closing argument. The Company continues to deny liability in this matter. While we may occasionally be party to large claims, including class action suits, we do not believe that any existing matters, individually or in the aggregate, will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2018 Form 10-K. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. c.

During the first quarter, the shares were purchased at an average price of $258.14. (2) As previously disclosed, on February 14, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $750.0 million share repurchase program, which has no expiration date. As of March 24, 2019, the Company had approximately $150.6 million remaining for future share repurchases under this program. Authorization for the repurchase program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. The repurchase of shares in any particular period and the actual amount of such purchases remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors, and no assurance can be given that shares will be repurchased in the future.

See accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 NNN REIT, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSO LIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : Organization and Nature of Business – NNN REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, formerly known as National Retail Properties, Inc., is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. The term ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refers to NNN REIT, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries. On May 1, 2023, National Retail Properties, Inc. changed its name to NNN REIT, Inc. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . September 30, 2023 Property Portfolio: Total Properties 3,511 Gross leasable area (square feet) 35,797,000 States 49 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.1 NNN's operations are reported within one operating segment in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and all properties are considered part of the Properties or Property Portfolio. As such, property counts and calculations involving property counts reflect all NNN Properties. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. Amounts as of December 31, 2022, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2020 and 2021, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (see ""Note 2 – Real Estate""). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Topic 810, Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest, third-party costs and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 2,374,000 and $ 547,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $ 1,248,000 and $ 273,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 9 Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final value relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is valued by comparing the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting for existing in-place leases to the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. This intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN records right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. When NNN deems the collection of rental income from a tenant not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed as a reduction to rental income and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. At this point, a tenant is deemed cash basis for accounting purposes. 10 As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $ 348,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent for certain tenants reclassified to cash basis for accounting purposes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . No such outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of September 30: 2023 2022 Number of tenants 8 8 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total Properties 4.8 % 5.2 % Total annual base rent (1) 6.9 % 7.1 % Total gross leasable area 6.4 % 6.8 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place for each respective period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 44,368,000 and $ 46,631,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes, of which $ 14,281,000 and $ 15,346,000 was recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN records ROU assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating lease. NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognizes a ROU asset (recorded in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. NNN uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. In January 2023, NNN amended its headquarters office lease and extended the lease term until March 31, 2034. The amendment resulted in an increase in the ROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately $ 6,401,000 . Real Estate – Held for Sale – Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in FASB ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant and Equipment , including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. At September 30, 2023, NNN had no properties classified as held for sale. At December 31, 2022 , NNN had recorded real estate held for sale of $ 786,000 (two properties) in real estate portfolio on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The two properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Real Estate Dispositions – When real estate is disposed, the related cost, accumulated depreciation or amortization and any accrued rental income from operating leases and the net investment from direct financing leases are removed from the accounts, and gains and losses from the dispositions are reflected in income. Gains from the disposition of real estate are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance FASB ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (""ASC 610-20""), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by NNN with the real estate sold are met. 11 Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN held mortgages receivable, including accrued interest, of $ 1,114,000 and $ 1,530,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, net of $ 71,000 and $ 98,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Cash and Cash Equivalents – NNN considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Cash accounts maintained on behalf of NNN in demand deposits at commercial banks and money market funds may exceed federally insured levels or may be held in accounts without any federal insurance or any other insurance or guarantee. However, NNN has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Restricted Cash and Cash Held in Escrow – Restricted cash and cash held in escrow include (i) cash proceeds from the sale of assets held by qualified intermediaries in anticipation of the acquisition of replacement properties in tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), (ii) cash that has been placed in escrow for the future funding of construction commitments, or (iii) cash that is not immediately available to NNN. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , NNN held $ 21,126,000 and $ 4,273,000 , respectively, in escrow and other restricted accounts . Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the Credit Facility (as defined below) as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. NNN had debt costs of $ 42,595,000 and $ 38,145,000 , included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, net of accumulated amortization of $ 13,621,000 and $ 11,693,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. 12 The core principle of FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as transaction price allocation. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders $ 106,787 $ 88,421 $ 295,658 $ 243,964 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 171 ) ( 135 ) ( 448 ) ( 471 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 106,616 $ 88,286 $ 295,210 $ 243,493 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 182,424,814 177,881,613 182,092,117 176,510,417 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 290,458 ) ( 246,116 ) ( 268,713 ) ( 292,433 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 736,083 ) ( 734,711 ) ( 702,441 ) ( 675,628 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 181,398,273 176,900,786 181,120,963 175,542,356 Other dilutive securities 323,194 466,924 339,659 451,551 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 181,721,467 177,367,710 181,460,622 175,993,907 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on income it distributes to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. As of September 30, 2023 , NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. 13 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement . The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2022 $ ( 12,582 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,843 (2) Ending balance, September 30, 2023 $ ( 10,739 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in ""Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives"". (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities which are required to prepare the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Estimates are sensitive to evaluations by management about current and future expectations of market and economic conditions. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 14 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At September 30, 2023, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.1 years and consisted of 3,521 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the Property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or (iii) to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,823,053 $ 2,669,498 Buildings and improvements 7,226,852 6,985,394 Leasehold interests 355 355 10,050,260 9,655,247 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,813,920 ) ( 1,660,308 ) 8,236,340 7,994,939 Work in progress and improvements 106,615 21,737 Accounted for using the operating method 8,342,955 8,016,676 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,107 3,352 Classified as held for sale (2) — 786 $ 8,346,062 $ 8,020,814 (1) Includes $ 100,788 and $ 22,356 in land for Properties under construction at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. (2) As of September 30, 2023 , no Properties were classified as held for sale. 15 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Rental income from operating leases $ 200,287 $ 188,840 $ 596,099 $ 558,942 Earned income from direct financing leases 140 148 427 449 Percentage rent 336 235 1,390 1,231 Rental revenues 200,763 189,223 597,916 560,622 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,093 3,879 12,996 12,779 $ 204,856 $ 193,102 $ 610,912 $ 573,401 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. During 2021 and 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants in the Property Portfolio, for an aggregate $ 4,722,000 and $ 51,723,000 of rent originally due for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. As of September 30, 2023, an aggregate of approximately 93 percent of deferred rent has been repaid with $ 2,648,000 and $ 11,520,000 of deferred rent repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, of which $ 476,000 and $ 3,458,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 1,496,000 and ($ 3,298,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which $ 493,000 and ($ 655,000 ) of such income, net of reserves was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,356 $ 15,356 Less: accumulated amortization ( 11,979 ) ( 11,477 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 3,377 $ 3,879 In-place leases $ 122,956 $ 124,198 Less: accumulated amortization ( 83,890 ) ( 79,675 ) In-place leases, net $ 39,066 $ 44,523 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,217 $ 41,371 Less: accumulated amortization ( 28,849 ) ( 28,121 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 12,368 $ 13,250 16 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, were $ 349,000 and $ 410,000 , respectively, of which $ 115,000 and $ 130,000 were recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, was $ 5,197,000 and $ 5,337,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,671,000 and $ 1,793,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 13 $ 19,992 8 $ 5,889 26 $ 40,222 26 $ 10,656 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 57 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 to 18 months. These construction commitments, as of September 30, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 391,604 Less amount funded ( 207,403 ) Remaining commitment $ 184,201 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs, capitalized interest and third-party costs. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 1,001 $ 971 $ 3,675 $ 7,221 Number of Properties: Vacant 1 2 4 8 Occupied 1 1 2 6 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 17 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 201,296,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.79 % during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from the London Interbank Offer Rate (""LIBOR"") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2023, no amount was outstanding and $ 1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the Credit Facility financial covenants. Note 4 – Mortgages Payable : In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $ 9,774,000 . Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives : In August 2023, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its August 2023 shelf registration statement (see ""Note 6 – Stockholder's Equity"") and issued $ 500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.600 % notes due October 2033 (the ""2033 Notes""). The 2033 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate net price of $ 488,380,000 with interest payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15, commencing April 15, 2024. The discount of $ 11,620,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2033 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 5.905 % . The 2033 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. NNN may redeem the 2033 Notes, in whole or part, at any time prior to the par call date at the redemption price as set forth in the supplemental indenture dated August 8, 2023 relating to the 2033 Notes; provided, however, that if NNN redeems the notes on or after the par call date, the redemption price will equal 100 % of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest there on to, but not including, the redemption date. NNN received approximately $ 483,930,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2033 Notes, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 4,450,000 for the 2033 Notes. As of September 30, 2023, $ 10,739,000 remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 1,843,000 and $ 1,770,000 , respectively, of which $ 620,000 and $ 595,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,321,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at September 30, 2023. Additional information related to NNN's notes payable and derivatives is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. 18 Note 6 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2023, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2023 ATM 2020 ATM Shelf registration statement: Effective date August 2023 August 2020 Termination date August 2026 August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2023 — 7,722,511 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 650,135 2,801,778 Average price per share (net) $ 43.52 $ 45.42 Net proceeds $ 28,292 $ 127,270 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 858 $ 1,879 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 55,261 51,567 Net proceeds $ 2,302 $ 2,258 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Dividends $ 102,647 $ 97,008 $ 301,793 $ 282,637 Per share 0.5650 0.5500 1.6650 1.6100 In October 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5650 per share, which is payable in November 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2023 . 19 Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believed that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at December 31, 2022 approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). NNN had no mortgages payable outstanding at September 30, 2023. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,529,934,000 and $ 3,140,774,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. 20 Item 2. Management’s Discussion a nd Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NNN REIT, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022 (""2022 Annual Report""). The term “NNN” or the “Company” refers to NNN REIT, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Effective May 1, 2023, National Retail Properties, Inc. changed its name to NNN REIT, Inc. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of September 30, 2023, NNN owned 3,511 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 35,797,000 square feet, located in 49 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.1 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2023. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its significant current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its significant tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. 22 NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the restaurant (including full and limited service) (17.6%), convenience store (16.8%), and automotive service (14.7%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Property Portfolio remained approximately 99 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN and the Property Portfolio is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. Results of Operations Property Analysis General. The following table summarizes the Property Portfolio: September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 Properties Owned: Number 3,511 3,411 3,349 Total gross leasable area (square feet) 35,797,000 35,010,000 34,265,000 Properties: Leased and unimproved land 3,484 3,390 3,328 Percent of Properties – leased and unimproved land 99 % 99 % 99 % Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.1 10.4 10.4 Total gross leasable area (square feet) – leased 35,462,000 34,829,000 34,096,000 23 The following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio based on the top 20 lines of trade: % of Annual Base Rent (1) Lines of Trade September 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 1.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 46 52 125 154 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 449,000 613,000 1,003,000 1,840,000 Cap rate (2) 7.4 % 6.3 % 7.2 % 6.2 % Total dollars invested (3) $ 212,493 $ 223,138 $ 550,034 $ 587,730 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) The cap rate is a weighted average, calculated as the initial cash annual base rent divided by the total purchase price of the Properties. (3) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective period. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets, with undistributed funds from operations, or with proceeds from the sale of Properties. 24 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Number of properties 13 8 26 26 Gross leasable area (square feet) 135,000 96,000 189,000 271,000 Net sales proceeds $ 49,006 $ 21,195 $ 89,164 $ 49,174 Net gain on disposition of real estate $ 19,992 $ 5,889 $ 40,222 $ 10,656 Cap rate (1) 6.0 % 5.8 % 5.8 % 5.9 % (1) The cap rate is a weighted average of properties occupied at disposition, calculated as the cash annual base rent divided by the total sales price of the properties. NNN typically uses the disposition proceeds to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Percent Increase Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 200,763 $ 189,223 6.1 % $ 597,916 $ 560,622 6.7 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,093 3,879 5.5 % 12,996 12,779 1.7 % Rental income 204,856 193,102 6.1 % 610,912 573,401 6.5 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 276 369 (25.2 )% 968 1,132 (14.5 )% Total revenues $ 205,132 $ 193,471 6.0 % $ 611,880 $ 574,533 6.5 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the Rental Revenues from NNN's recent Property acquisitions (see ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions""). 25 Analysis of Expenses The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Percent Increase Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 10,225 $ 10,124 1.0 % $ 33,216 $ 30,906 7.5 % Real estate 6,459 5,875 9.9 % 20,141 19,246 4.7 % Depreciation and amortization 59,523 56,388 5.6 % 178,546 166,512 7.2 % Leasing transaction costs 96 96 — 223 260 (14.2 )% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 1,001 971 3.1 % 3,675 7,221 (49.1 )% Executive retirement costs 153 556 (72.5 )% 885 6,805 (87.0 )% Total operating expenses $ 77,457 $ 74,010 4.7 % $ 236,686 $ 230,950 2.5 % Interest and other income $ (644 ) $ (33 ) 1,851.5 % $ (751 ) $ (120 ) 525.8 % Interest expense 41,524 36,962 12.3 % 120,509 110,400 9.2 % Total other expenses $ 40,880 $ 36,929 10.7 % $ 119,758 $ 110,280 8.6 % As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.0 % 5.2 % 5.4 % 5.4 % Real estate 3.1 % 3.0 % 3.3 % 3.3 % General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in long-term incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the increase in NNN's Property Portfolio from recent acquisitions (see ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions""). Impairment Losses – Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, which were less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive Retirement Costs. In April 2022, the former President and Chief Executive Officer retired from employment, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process and as previously announced in January 2022. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs in connection with the long-term incentive compensation related to the retirement and transition agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to: 26 Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and construction commitments; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund both its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional Properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations, borrowings from NNN's Credit Facility or proceeds from the sale of Properties. As of September 30, 2023, NNN had $98,263,000 of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $1,100,000,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN may also fund liquidity requirements with new debt or equity issuances, although newly issued debt may be at higher interest rates than the rates on NNN's existing debt outstanding. NNN has the ability to limit future property acquisitions and strategically increase property dispositions. NNN expects these sources of liquidity and the discretionary nature of its property acquisition funding needs will allow NNN to meet its financial obligations over the long term. Cash Flows. NNN had $98,263,000 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $21,126,000 was restricted cash or cash held in escrow at September 30, 2023. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash: Provided by operating activities $ 490,813 $ 465,271 Used in investing activities (436,271 ) (526,808 ) Provided by (used in) financing activities 36,943 (106,508 ) Increase (decrease) 91,485 (168,045 ) Net cash at beginning of period 6,778 171,322 Net cash at end of period $ 98,263 $ 3,277 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental income and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand, borrowings from its Credit Facility or proceeds from the sale of Properties to fund the acquisition of its Properties. 27 Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, included the following significant transactions: Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (iv) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise. The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2023 (see ""Capital Structure"") (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 4,300,000 $ — $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 2,800,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 2,000,508 41,100 157,006 148,750 134,225 119,233 1,400,194 Headquarters office lease 10,309 206 837 210 981 1,005 7,070 Total contractual cash obligations $ 6,310,817 $ 41,306 $ 507,843 $ 548,960 $ 485,206 $ 520,238 $ 4,207,264 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under notes payable and excludes unamortized note discounts and debt costs. (2) Interest calculation on notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 57 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 to 18 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 391,604 Less amount funded (207,403 ) Remaining commitment $ 184,201 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs, capitalized interest and third-party costs. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. 28 The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of September 30, 2023, NNN owned 27 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for less than one percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of October 27, 2023, less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to one tenant currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm its leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Dividends $ 102,647 $ 97,008 $ 301,793 $ 282,637 Per share 0.5650 0.5500 1.6650 1.6100 In October 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5650 per share which is payable in November 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2023. C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to fund property acquisitions and construction on its Properties and to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2023 Percentage of Total December 31, 2022 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ — — $ 166,200 4.2 % Mortgages payable (1) — — 9,964 0.3 % Notes payable 4,227,164 100.0 % 3,739,890 95.5 % Total outstanding debt $ 4,227,164 100.0 % $ 3,916,054 100.0 % (1) In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $9,774. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $1,100,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $201,296,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.79% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2023, no amount was outstanding and $1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 29 Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2023, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. Debt Securities – Notes Payable. Each of NNN’s outstanding series of unsecured notes is summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Notes (1) Issue Date Principal Discount (2) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (3) Maturity Date 2024 (4) May 2014 $ 350,000 $ 707 $ 349,293 3.900% 3.924% June 2024 (5) 2025 (4) October 2015 400,000 964 399,036 4.000% 4.029% November 2025 (5) 2026 (4) December 2016 350,000 3,860 346,140 3.600% 3.733% December 2026 (5) 2027 (4) September 2017 400,000 1,628 398,372 3.500% 3.548% October 2027 (5) 2028 (4) September 2018 400,000 2,848 397,152 4.300% 4.388% October 2028 2030 (4) March 2020 400,000 1,288 398,712 2.500% 2.536% April 2030 2033 August 2023 500,000 11,620 488,380 5.600% 5.905% October 2033 2048 September 2018 300,000 4,239 295,761 4.800% 4.890% October 2048 2050 March 2020 300,000 6,066 293,934 3.100% 3.205% April 2050 2051 March 2021 450,000 8,406 441,594 3.500% 3.602% April 2051 2052 (4) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000% 3.118% April 2052 (1) The proceeds from the note issuances were used to pay down outstanding debt of NNN’s Credit Facility, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $300,000 5.500% notes payable that were due 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $325,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in 2022. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes were also used to redeem all of the $350,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in 2023. Proceeds from the issuance of the 2052 Notes were also used to redeem all of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. (2) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (3) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (4) NNN entered into forward starting swaps which hedged the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in other comprehensive income. The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in ""Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives"". (5) The aggregate principal balance of the unsecured note maturities for the next five years is $1,500,000. Each series of the notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. NNN may redeem each series of notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to the par call date for the notes at the redemption price as set forth in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes; provided, however, that if NNN redeems the notes on or after the par call date, the redemption price will equal 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but not including, the redemption date. In connection with the outstanding debt offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $42,595,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, pursuant to which NNN’s notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios and (ii) certain interest coverage. At September 30, 2023, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. 30 Equity Securities At-The-Market Offerings. NNN has established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2023 ATM 2020 ATM Shelf registration statement: Effective date August 2023 August 2020 Termination date August 2026 August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2023 — 7,722,511 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 650,135 2,801,778 Average price per share (net) $ 43.52 $ 45.42 Net proceeds $ 28,292 $ 127,270 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 858 $ 1,879 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 55,261 51,567 Net proceeds $ 2,302 $ 2,258 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates are sensitive to evaluations by management about current and future expectations of market and economic conditions. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates is included in NNN’s 2022 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 31 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of September 30, 2023, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. As of September 30, 2023, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had no amount outstanding and a weighted average outstanding balance of $201,296,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.79% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to a weighted average outstanding balance of $21,592,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.01% for the same period in 2022. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2023. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2023, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by approximately one percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Debt Obligations (dollars in thousands) Variable Rate Debt Fixed Rate Debt Credit Facility Unsecured Debt (1) Debt Obligation Weighted Average Interest Rate Principal Debt Obligation Effective Interest Rate 2023 $ — — $ — — 2024 — — 350,000 3.92 % 2025 — — 400,000 4.03 % 2026 — — 350,000 3.73 % 2027 — — 400,000 3.55 % Thereafter — — 2,800,000 3.99 % (2) Total $ — — $ 4,300,000 3.93 % Fair Value: September 30, 2023 $ — $ 3,529,934 December 31, 2022 $ 166,200 $ 3,140,774 (1) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude unamortized discounts and debt costs. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. Unsecured debt has a weighted average maturity of 12.6 years. (2) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2027. 32 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2023, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 33 PART II.

See accompanying notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. 8 NNN REIT, INC. and SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSO LIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2023 (Unaudited) Note 1 – Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies : Organization and Nature of Business – NNN REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, formerly known as National Retail Properties, Inc., is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. The term ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refers to NNN REIT, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries. On May 1, 2023, National Retail Properties, Inc. changed its name to NNN REIT, Inc. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . June 30, 2023 Property Portfolio: Total Properties 3,479 Gross leasable area (square feet) 35,492,000 States 49 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.2 NNN's operations are reported within one operating segment in the condensed consolidated financial statements and all properties are considered part of the Properties or Property Portfolio. As such, property counts and calculations involving property counts reflect all NNN Properties. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. Amounts as of December 31, 2022, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2020 and 2021, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (see ""Note 2 – Real Estate""). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 1,126,000 and $ 274,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $ 721,000 and $ 176,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. 9 The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final value relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is valued by comparing the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting for existing in-place leases to the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. This intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN records right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. When NNN deems the collection of rental income from a tenant not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed as a reduction to rental income and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. At this point, a tenant is deemed cash basis for accounting purposes. 10 As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $ 348,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent for certain tenants reclassified to cash basis for accounting purposes during the six months ended June 30, 2023 . No such outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of June 30: 2023 2022 Number of tenants 9 8 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total Properties 5.0 % 5.3 % Total annual base rent (1) 7.1 % 7.2 % Total gross leasable area 6.8 % 6.9 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place for each respective period. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 30,088,000 and $ 31,285,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes, of which $ 14,523,000 and $ 15,499,000 was recognized during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN records ROU assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating lease. NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognizes a ROU asset (recorded in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. NNN uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. In January 2023, NNN amended its headquarters office lease and extended the lease term until March 31, 2034. The amendment resulted in an increase in the ROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately $ 6,401,000 . Real Estate – Held for Sale – Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, ""Property, Plant and Equipment,"" including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , NNN had recorded real estate held for sale of $ 1,904,000 (two Properties) and $ 786,000 (two properties), respectively, in real estate portfolio on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The two properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 were sold during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Real Estate Dispositions – When real estate is disposed, the related cost, accumulated depreciation or amortization and any accrued rental income from operating leases and the net investment from direct financing leases are removed from the accounts, and gains and losses from the dispositions are reflected in income. Gains from the disposition of real estate are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance FASB, ASC 610-20, ""Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets"" (""ASC 610-20""), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by NNN with the real estate sold are met. 11 Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326),” requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN held mortgages receivable, including accrued interest, of $ 1,224,000 and $ 1,530,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, net of $ 78,000 and $ 98,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Cash and Cash Equivalents – NNN considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Cash accounts maintained on behalf of NNN in demand deposits at commercial banks and money market funds may exceed federally insured levels or may be held in accounts without any federal insurance or any other insurance or guarantee. However, NNN has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Restricted Cash and Cash Held in Escrow – Restricted cash and cash held in escrow include (i) cash proceeds from the sale of assets held by qualified intermediaries in anticipation of the acquisition of replacement properties in tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), (ii) cash that has been placed in escrow for the future funding of construction commitments, or (iii) cash that is not immediately available to NNN. As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , NNN held $ 2,971,000 and $ 4,273,000 , respectively, in escrow and other restricted accounts . Valuation of Trade Receivables – NNN estimates the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the Credit Facility (as defined below) as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. NNN had debt costs of $ 38,145,000 , included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net of accumulated amortization of $ 12,946,000 and $ 11,693,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. 12 The core principle of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (Topic 606), is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as transaction price allocation. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders $ 98,704 $ 74,171 $ 188,871 $ 155,543 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 162 ) ( 165 ) ( 295 ) ( 319 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 98,542 $ 74,006 $ 188,576 $ 155,224 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 182,123,555 175,989,323 181,923,011 175,813,456 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 295,441 ) ( 310,844 ) ( 267,861 ) ( 300,810 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 736,083 ) ( 721,623 ) ( 685,341 ) ( 645,597 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 181,092,031 174,956,856 180,969,809 174,867,049 Other dilutive securities 535,826 151,058 574,466 154,822 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 181,627,857 175,107,914 181,544,275 175,021,871 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on income it distributes to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. As of June 30, 2023 , NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. 13 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2023 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2022 $ ( 12,582 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,223 (2) Ending balance, June 30, 2023 $ ( 11,359 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Notes Payable and Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities which are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 14 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At June 30, 2023, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.2 years and consisted of 3,492 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the Property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or (iii) to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,765,263 $ 2,669,498 Buildings and improvements 7,166,833 6,985,394 Leasehold interests 355 355 9,932,451 9,655,247 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,766,177 ) ( 1,660,308 ) 8,166,274 7,994,939 Work in progress and improvements 49,823 21,737 Accounted for using the operating method 8,216,097 8,016,676 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,191 3,352 Classified as held for sale 1,904 786 $ 8,221,192 $ 8,020,814 (1) Includes $ 63,991 and $ 22,356 in land for Properties under construction at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 15 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Rental income from operating leases $ 197,629 $ 185,791 $ 395,812 $ 370,102 Earned income from direct financing leases 143 150 287 301 Percentage rent 291 295 1,054 996 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,363 4,300 8,903 8,900 $ 202,426 $ 190,536 $ 406,056 $ 380,299 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. During 2021 and 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants in the Property Portfolio, for an aggregate $ 4,722,000 and $ 51,723,000 of rent originally due for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. As of June 30, 2023, an aggregate of approximately 92 percent of deferred rent has been repaid with $ 2,172,000 and $ 8,062,000 of deferred rent repaid during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 , respectively, of which $ 486,000 and $ 4,005,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining deferred rents are substantially due by December 31, 2023. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 1,003,000 and ($ 2,643,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which $ 534,000 and ($ 1,547,000 ) of such income, net of reserves was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in accrued rental income are the net impacts of the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayments from the lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recorded ($ 19,000 ) and ($ 3,509,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments, of which ($ 10,000 ) and ($ 1,729,000 ) was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,356 $ 15,356 Less: accumulated amortization ( 11,816 ) ( 11,477 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 3,540 $ 3,879 In-place leases $ 123,468 $ 124,198 Less: accumulated amortization ( 82,845 ) ( 79,675 ) In-place leases, net $ 40,623 $ 44,523 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,267 $ 41,371 Less: accumulated amortization ( 28,634 ) ( 28,121 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 12,633 $ 13,250 16 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, were $ 234,000 and $ 280,000 , respectively, of which $ 122,000 and $ 140,000 were recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, was $ 3,527,000 and $ 3,544,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,767,000 and $ 1,771,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 7 $ 13,930 8 $ 775 13 $ 20,230 18 $ 4,767 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 39 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of June 30, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 268,159 Less amount funded ( 113,814 ) Remaining commitment $ 154,345 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 34 $ 4,618 $ 2,674 $ 6,250 Number of Properties: Vacant — 3 3 6 Occupied — 3 1 5 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 17 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 228,576,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.67 % during the six months ended June 30, 2023 . In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from the London Interbank Offer Rate (""LIBOR"") to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2023, $ 332,500,000 was outstanding and $ 767,500,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Mortgages Payable : In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $ 9,774,000 . Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2023 7,722,511 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 650,135 717,473 Average price per share (net) $ 43.98 $ 43.23 Net proceeds $ 28,592 $ 31,018 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 558 $ 575 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 35,922 34,396 Net proceeds $ 1,615 $ 1,456 18 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Dividends $ 99,745 $ 92,878 $ 199,146 $ 185,629 Per share 0.550 0.530 1.100 1.060 In July 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5650 per share, which is payable in August 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2023 . Note 6 – Notes Payable and Derivatives : Information related to NNN's notes payable and derivatives is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of June 30, 2023, $ 11,359,000 remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 1,223,000 and $ 1,175,000 , respectively, of which $ 616,000 and $ 592,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,490,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2023 . Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at December 31, 2022 approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). NNN had no mortgages payable outstanding at June 30, 2023. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,135,564,000 and $ 3,140,774,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion a nd Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NNN REIT, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2022 (""2022 Annual Report""). The term “NNN” or the “Company” refers to NNN REIT, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Effective May 1, 2023, National Retail Properties, Inc. changed its name to NNN REIT, Inc. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of June 30, 2023, NNN owned 3,479 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 35,492,000 square feet, located in 49 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.2 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of June 30, 2023. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its significant current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its significant tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the restaurant (including full and limited service) (17.7%), convenience store (16.9%), and automotive service (14.5%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 21 As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Property Portfolio remained at least 99 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN and the Property Portfolio is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Number of properties 7 8 13 18 Gross leasable area (square feet) 37,000 94,000 54,000 175,000 Net sales proceeds $ 28,233 $ 7,905 $ 40,158 $ 27,979 Net gain on disposition of real estate $ 13,930 $ 775 $ 20,230 $ 4,767 Cap rate (1) 5.1 % 7.9 % 5.6 % 6.2 % (1) The cap rate is a weighted average of properties occupied at disposition, calculated as the cash annual base rent divided by the total sales price of the properties. NNN typically uses the disposition proceeds to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Percent Increase Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 198,063 $ 186,236 6.4 % $ 397,153 $ 371,399 6.9 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,363 4,300 1.5 % 8,903 8,900 0.0 % Rental income 202,426 190,536 6.2 % 406,056 380,299 6.8 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 214 247 (13.4 )% 692 763 (9.3 )% Total revenues $ 202,640 $ 190,783 6.2 % $ 406,748 $ 381,062 6.7 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the Rental Revenues from NNN's recent Property acquisitions (see ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions""). 23 Analysis of Expenses The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Percent Increase Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) 2023 2022 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 10,740 $ 9,740 10.3 % $ 22,991 $ 20,782 10.6 % Real estate 6,836 6,173 10.7 % 13,682 13,371 2.3 % Depreciation and amortization 59,875 57,444 4.2 % 119,023 110,124 8.1 % Leasing transaction costs 52 76 (31.6 )% 127 164 (22.6 )% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 34 4,618 (99.3 )% 2,674 6,250 (57.2 )% Executive retirement costs 309 2,655 (88.4 )% 732 6,249 (88.3 )% Total operating expenses $ 77,846 $ 80,706 (3.5 )% $ 159,229 $ 156,940 1.5 % Interest and other income $ (74 ) $ (52 ) 42.3 % $ (107 ) $ (87 ) 23.0 % Interest expense 40,094 36,739 9.1 % 78,985 73,438 7.6 % Total other expenses $ 40,020 $ 36,687 9.1 % $ 78,878 $ 73,351 7.5 % As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.3% 5.1% 5.7% 5.5% Real estate 3.4% 3.2% 3.4% 3.5% General and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in long-term incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the increase in NNN's Property Portfolio from recent acquisitions (see ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions""). Impairment Losses – Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, which were less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive Retirement Costs. In April 2022, the former President and Chief Executive Officer retired from employment, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process and as previously announced in January 2022. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs in connection with the long-term incentive compensation related to the retirement and transition agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2023, as compared to the same periods in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the Credit Facility having a weighted average outstanding balance of $228,576,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to a weighted average outstanding balance of $9,028,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.04% for the six months ended June 30, 2022. 24 Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund both its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional Properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and advances from NNN's Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2023, NNN had $2,281,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $767,500,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN may also fund liquidity requirements with new debt or equity issuances, although newly issued debt may be at higher interest rates than the rates on NNN's existing debt outstanding. NNN has the ability to limit future property acquisitions and strategically increase property dispositions. NNN expects these sources of liquidity and the discretionary nature of its property acquisition funding needs will allow NNN to meet its financial obligations over the long term. Cash Flows. NNN had $2,281,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $2,971,000 in restricted cash or cash held in escrow at June 30, 2023. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 299,294 $ 275,311 Used in investing activities (288,109 ) (329,456 ) Used in financing activities (12,711 ) (113,888 ) Decrease (1,526 ) (168,033 ) Net cash at beginning of period 6,778 171,322 Net cash at end of period $ 5,252 $ 3,289 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from rental income and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2023, included the following significant transactions: 25 Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (iv) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise. The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2023 (see ""Capital Structure"") (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,800,000 $ — $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 2,300,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,753,441 68,200 129,006 120,750 106,225 91,233 1,238,027 Credit Facility 332,500 — — 332,500 — — — Headquarters office lease 10,515 412 837 210 981 1,005 7,070 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,896,456 $ 68,612 $ 479,843 $ 853,460 $ 457,206 $ 492,238 $ 3,545,097 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under notes payable and excludes unamortized note discounts and debt costs. (2) Interest calculation on notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 39 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at June 30, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 268,159 Less amount funded (113,814 ) Remaining commitment $ 154,345 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the Property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of June 30, 2023, NNN owned 22 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of July 31, 2023, less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to one tenant currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm its lease with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. 26 Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Dividends $ 99,745 $ 92,878 $ 199,146 $ 185,629 Per share 0.550 0.530 1.100 1.060 In July 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5650 per share which is payable in August 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2023. C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt, to finance property acquisitions and to fund construction on its Properties. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2023 Percentage of Total December 31, 2022 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ 332,500 8.2 % $ 166,200 4.2 % Mortgages payable (1) — — 9,964 0.3 % Notes payable 3,742,012 91.8 % 3,739,890 95.5 % Total outstanding debt $ 4,074,512 100.0 % $ 3,916,054 100.0 % (1) In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $9,774. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $1,100,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $228,576,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.67% during the six months ended June 30, 2023. In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2023, $332,500,000 was outstanding and $767,500,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. 27 Debt Securities – Notes Payable. Each of NNN’s outstanding series of unsecured notes is summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2024 (3) May 2014 $ 350,000 $ 707 $ 349,293 3.900% 3.924% June 2024 (4) 2025 (3) October 2015 400,000 964 399,036 4.000% 4.029% November 2025 (4) 2026 (3) December 2016 350,000 3,860 346,140 3.600% 3.733% December 2026 (4) 2027 (3) September 2017 400,000 1,628 398,372 3.500% 3.548% October 2027 (4) 2028 (3) September 2018 400,000 2,848 397,152 4.300% 4.388% October 2028 2030 (3) March 2020 400,000 1,288 398,712 2.500% 2.536% April 2030 2048 September 2018 300,000 4,239 295,761 4.800% 4.890% October 2048 2050 March 2020 300,000 6,066 293,934 3.100% 3.205% April 2050 2051 March 2021 450,000 8,406 441,594 3.500% 3.602% April 2051 2052 (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000% 3.118% April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward starting swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in other comprehensive income. The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Notes Payable and Derivatives. (4) The aggregate principal balance of the unsecured note maturities for the next five years is $1,500,000. Each series of the notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. Each of the notes is redeemable at the option of NNN, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes. In connection with the outstanding debt offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $38,145,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, pursuant to which NNN’s notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios and (ii) certain interest coverage. At June 30, 2023, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. 28 Equity Securities At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2023 7,722,511 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 650,135 717,473 Average price per share (net) $ 43.98 $ 43.23 Net proceeds $ 28,592 $ 31,018 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 558 $ 575 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 35,922 34,396 Net proceeds $ 1,615 $ 1,456 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates is included in NNN’s 2022 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 29 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of June 30, 2023, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had $332,500,000 outstanding, a weighted average outstanding balance of $228,576,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.67% compared to a weighted average outstanding balance of $9,028,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.04% for the same period in 2022. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2023. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of June 30, 2023, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by approximately one percent for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. (2) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2027. 30 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of June 30, 2023, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 31 PART II.

The term ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refers to NNN REIT, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN may elect to treat certain subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries. On May 1, 2023, National Retail Properties, Inc. changed its name to NNN REIT, Inc. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . March 31, 2023 Property Portfolio: Total Properties 3,449 Gross leasable area (square feet) 35,251,000 States 49 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.3 NNN's operations are reported within one operating segment in the condensed consolidated financial statements and all properties are considered part of the Properties or Property Portfolio. As such, property counts and calculations involving property counts reflect all NNN Properties. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2023. Amounts as of December 31, 2022, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2020 and 2021, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (see ""Note 2 – Real Estate""). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 405,000 and $ 98,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. 7 The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final value relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is valued by comparing the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting for existing in-place leases to the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. This intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN records right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. When NNN deems the collection of rental income from a tenant not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed as a reduction to rental income and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. At this point, a tenant is deemed cash basis for accounting purposes. 8 As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $ 232,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent for certain tenants reclassified to cash basis for accounting purposes during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 . No such outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of: March 31, 2023 2022 Number of tenants 10 9 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total Properties 5.0 % 5.4 % Total annual base rent (1) 7.1 % 7.3 % Total gross leasable area 6.7 % 7.0 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place for each respective period. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 15,565,000 and $ 15,786,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting purposes. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN records ROU assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating lease. NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognizes a ROU asset (recorded in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. NNN uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. In January 2023, NNN amended its headquarters office lease and extended the lease term until March 31, 2034. The amendment resulted in an increase in the ROU asset and operating lease liability of approximately $ 6,401,000 . Real Estate – Held for Sale – Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, ""Property, Plant and Equipment,"" including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , NNN had recorded real estate held for sale of $ 3,410,000 (one property) and $ 786,000 (two properties), respectively, in real estate portfolio on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The two properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2022 were sold during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Real Estate Dispositions – When real estate is disposed, the related cost, accumulated depreciation or amortization and any accrued rental income from operating leases and the net investment from direct financing leases are removed from the accounts, and gains and losses from the dispositions are reflected in income. Gains from the disposition of real estate are generally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance FASB, ASC 610-20, ""Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets"" (""ASC 610-20""), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by NNN with the real estate sold are met. 9 Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326),” requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN held mortgages receivable, including accrued interest, of $ 1,426,000 and $ 1,530,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, net of $ 91,000 and $ 98,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Cash and Cash Equivalents – NNN considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market accounts. Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value. Cash accounts maintained on behalf of NNN in demand deposits at commercial banks and money market funds may exceed federally insured levels or may be held in accounts without any federal insurance or any other insurance or guarantee. However, NNN has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Restricted Cash and Cash Held in Escrow – Restricted cash and cash held in escrow include (i) cash proceeds from the sale of assets held by qualified intermediaries in anticipation of the acquisition of replacement properties in tax-free exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), (ii) cash that has been placed in escrow for the future funding of construction commitments, or (iii) cash that is not immediately available to NNN. As of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, NNN held $ 2,086,000 and $ 4,273,000 , respectively, in escrow and other restricted accounts . Valuation of Trade Receivables – NNN estimates the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the credit facility as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. NNN had debt costs of $ 38,145,000 , included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, net of accumulated amortization of $ 12,316,000 and $ 11,693,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. 10 The core principle of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" (Topic 606), is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders $ 90,167 $ 81,372 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 132 ) ( 156 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 90,035 $ 81,216 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 181,720,238 175,635,634 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 240,699 ) ( 294,665 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 634,036 ) ( 568,726 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 180,845,503 174,772,243 Other dilutive securities 588,842 138,970 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 181,434,345 174,911,213 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on income it distributes to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. As of March 31, 2023 , NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. 11 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2022 $ ( 12,582 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 607 (2) Ending balance, March 31, 2023 $ ( 11,975 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 12 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At March 31, 2023, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.3 years and consisted of 3,469 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or (iii) to a lesser extent, increases in the tenant's sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,718,117 $ 2,669,498 Buildings and improvements 7,054,296 6,985,394 Leasehold interests 355 355 9,772,768 9,655,247 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,713,611 ) ( 1,660,308 ) 8,059,157 7,994,939 Work in progress and improvements 45,783 21,737 Accounted for using the operating method 8,104,940 8,016,676 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,272 3,352 Classified as held for sale 3,410 786 $ 8,111,622 $ 8,020,814 (1) Includes $ 54,582 and $ 22,356 in land for Properties under construction at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. 13 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Rental income from operating leases $ 198,183 $ 184,311 Earned income from direct financing leases 144 151 Percentage rent 763 701 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,540 4,600 $ 203,630 $ 189,763 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. During 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants in the Property Portfolio, for an aggregate $ 4,722,000 and $ 51,945,000 of rent originally due for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. As of March 31, 2023, an aggregate of approximately 91 percent of deferred rent has been repaid with $ 1,706,000 and $ 4,057,000 of deferred rent repaid during the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The remaining deferred rents are substantially due periodically by December 31, 2023. For the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NNN recognized $ 469,000 and ($ 1,096,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income, net of reserves. Included in accrued rental income are the net impacts of the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayments from the lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NNN recorded ($ 9,000 ) and ($ 1,780,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,356 $ 15,356 Less: accumulated amortization ( 11,647 ) ( 11,477 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 3,709 $ 3,879 In-place leases $ 124,198 $ 124,198 Less: accumulated amortization ( 81,435 ) ( 79,675 ) In-place leases, net $ 42,763 $ 44,523 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,371 $ 41,371 Less: accumulated amortization ( 28,403 ) ( 28,121 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 12,968 $ 13,250 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, were $ 112,000 and $ 140,000 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 1,760,000 and $ 1,773,000 , respectively. 14 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 6 $ 6,300 10 $ 3,992 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 32 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of March 31, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 253,106 Less amount funded ( 100,365 ) Remaining commitment $ 152,741 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 2,640 $ 1,632 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 3 Occupied 1 2 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 15 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 182,350,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.35 % during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 . In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2023, $ 209,000,000 was outstanding and $ 891,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 16 Note 4 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2023 7,422,185 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Shares of common stock 349,809 Average price per share (net) $ 45.95 Net proceeds $ 16,074 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 294 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 17,760 17,571 Net proceeds $ 822 $ 748 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Common stock: Dividends $ 99,401 $ 92,751 Per share 0.550 0.530 In April 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.550 per share, which is payable in May 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of April 28, 2023 . 17 Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives : Information related to NNN's notes payable and derivatives is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of March 31, 2023, $ 11,975,000 remained in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NNN reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 607,000 and $ 583,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,497,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2023 . Note 6 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,207,626,000 and $ 3,140,774,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 7 – Subsequent Events : NNN has reviewed its subsequent events which have occurred after March 31, 2023, the date of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $ 9,774,000 which was due in July 2023. No penalty was incurred as a result of this repayment. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 18 Item 2.

NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of March 31, 2023, NNN owned 3,449 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 35,251,000 square feet, located in 49 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.3 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of March 31, 2023. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its significant current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its significant tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the restaurant (including full and limited service) (17.9%), convenience store (16.3%), and automotive service (14.4%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 20 As of March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Property Portfolio remained at least 99 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN and the Property Portfolio is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

Rental income increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase is primarily due to Property acquisitions: Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase 2023 2022 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 12,251 $ 11,042 10.9 % Real estate 6,846 7,198 (4.9 )% Depreciation and amortization 59,148 52,680 12.3 % Leasing transaction costs 75 88 (14.8 )% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 2,640 1,632 61.8 % Executive retirement costs 423 3,594 (88.2 )% Total operating expenses $ 81,383 $ 76,234 6.8 % Interest and other income $ (33 ) $ (35 ) (5.7 )% Interest expense 38,891 36,699 6.0 % Total other expenses $ 38,858 $ 36,664 6.0 % As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 6.0% 5.8% Real estate 3.4% 3.8% Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in long-term incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to the acquisition of 43 Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 275,000 square feet in 2023 and 223 Properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,629,000 square feet in 2022. 23 Impairment Losses – Real Estate, Net of Recoveries. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 2,640 $ 1,632 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 3 Occupied 1 2 For the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive Retirement Costs. Executive retirement costs decreased for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. In April 2022, the former President and Chief Executive Officer retired from employment, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process and as previously announced in January 2022. During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs in connection with the long-term incentive compensation related to the retirement and transition agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase is primarily due to the Credit Facility having a weighted average outstanding balance of $182,350,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.35% for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 compared to no weighted average outstanding balance for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund both its short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional Properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and advances from NNN's Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2023, NNN had $3,240,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $891,000,000 available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. NNN may also fund liquidity requirements with new debt or equity issuances, although newly issued debt may be at higher interest rates than the rates on NNN's existing debt outstanding. NNN has the ability to limit future property acquisitions and strategically increase property dispositions. NNN expects these sources of liquidity and the discretionary nature of its property acquisition funding needs will allow NNN to meet its financial obligations over the long term. 24 Cash Flows. NNN had $3,240,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $2,086,000 in restricted cash or cash held in escrow at March 31, 2023. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 180,822 $ 164,338 Used in investing activities (142,346 ) (189,643 ) Used in financing activities (39,928 ) (92,281 ) Decrease (1,452 ) (117,586 ) Net cash at beginning of period 6,778 171,322 Net cash at end of period $ 5,326 $ 53,736 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, included the following significant transactions: Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors); and (iv) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise. The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2023 (see ""Capital Structure"") (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,809,774 $ 9,774 (2) $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 2,300,000 Long-term debt – interest (3) 1,787,713 102,472 129,006 120,750 106,225 91,233 1,238,027 Credit Facility 209,000 — — 209,000 — — — Headquarters office lease 10,721 618 837 210 981 1,005 7,070 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,817,208 $ 112,864 $ 479,843 $ 729,960 $ 457,206 $ 492,238 $ 3,545,097 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and debt costs. (2) In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $9,774 which was due in July 2023. No penalty was incurred as a result of this repayment. (3) Interest calculation on notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. 25 Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 32 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at March 31, 2023, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 253,106 Less amount funded (100,365 ) Remaining commitment $ 152,741 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of March 31, 2023, NNN owned 20 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of April 27, 2023, less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for NNN's common stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Common stock: Dividends $ 99,401 $ 92,751 Per share 0.550 0.530 In April 2023, NNN declared a dividend of $0.550 per share which is payable in May 2023 to its common stockholders of record as of April 28, 2023. 26 C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt, to finance property acquisitions and to fund construction on its Properties. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2023 Percentage of Total December 31, 2022 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ 209,000 5.3 % $ 166,200 4.2 % Mortgages payable (1) 9,774 0.2 % 9,964 0.3 % Notes payable 3,740,945 94.5 % 3,739,890 95.5 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,959,719 100.0 % $ 3,916,054 100.0 % (1) In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $9,774 which was due in July 2023. No penalty was incurred as a result of this repayment. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $1,100,000,000 Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $182,350,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.35% during the quarter ended March 31, 2023. In December 2022, NNN entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility, to change the base interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") plus a SOFR adjustment of 10 basis points (""Adjusted SOFR""). The Credit Facility bears interest at Adjusted SOFR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2023, $209,000,000 was outstanding and $891,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's 2022 Annual Report. Debt Securities – Notes Payable. Each of NNN’s outstanding series of unsecured notes is summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2024 (3) May 2014 $ 350,000 $ 707 $ 349,293 3.900% 3.924% June 2024 (4) 2025 (3) October 2015 400,000 964 399,036 4.000% 4.029% November 2025 (4) 2026 (3) December 2016 350,000 3,860 346,140 3.600% 3.733% December 2026 (4) 2027 (3) September 2017 400,000 1,628 398,372 3.500% 3.548% October 2027 (4) 2028 (3) September 2018 400,000 2,848 397,152 4.300% 4.388% October 2028 2030 (3) March 2020 400,000 1,288 398,712 2.500% 2.536% April 2030 2048 September 2018 300,000 4,239 295,761 4.800% 4.890% October 2048 2050 March 2020 300,000 6,066 293,934 3.100% 3.205% April 2050 2051 March 2021 450,000 8,406 441,594 3.500% 3.602% April 2051 2052 (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000% 3.118% April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward starting swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of a series of unsecured notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in other comprehensive income. The deferred liability (asset) is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 5 – Notes Payable and Derivatives. (4) The aggregate principal balance of the unsecured note maturities for the next five years is $1,500,000. 27 Each series of the notes represents senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN. Each of the notes is redeemable at the option of NNN, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the redemption date and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture relating to the notes. In connection with the outstanding debt offerings, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $38,145,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In accordance with the terms of the indentures, pursuant to which NNN’s notes have been issued, NNN is required to meet certain restrictive financial covenants, which, among other things, require NNN to maintain (i) certain leverage ratios and (ii) certain interest coverage. At March 31, 2023, NNN was in compliance with those covenants. Equity Securities At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2023 7,422,185 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Shares of common stock 349,809 Average price per share (net) $ 45.95 Net proceeds $ 16,074 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 294 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2023 2022 Shares of common stock 17,760 17,571 Net proceeds $ 822 $ 748 28 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates are included in NNN’s 2022 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 29 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of March 31, 2023, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. As of March 31, 2023, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had $209,000,000 outstanding, a weighted average outstanding balance of $182,350,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 5.35% compared to no weighted average outstanding balance for the same period in 2022. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2023. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of March 31, 2023, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by approximately one percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.

In April 2023, NNN repaid the remaining mortgages payable principal balance of $9,774 which was due in July 2023. No penalty was incurred as a result of this repayment. (2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude unamortized discounts and debt costs. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2027. 30 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of March 31, 2023, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 31 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . September 30, 2022 Property Portfolio: Total Properties 3,349 Gross leasable area (square feet) 34,265,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.4 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2022. Amounts as of December 31, 2021, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2020 and 2021, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See ""Note 2 – Real Estate""). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 547,000 and $ 215,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of which $ 273,000 and $ 87,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. 9 The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is valued by comparing the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting for existing in-place leases to the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. This intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN records right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 4,758,000 and $ 52,019,000 of rent originally due for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 31,776,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2021 and approximately $ 11,561,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. An additional $ 2,965,000 is due during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, with substantially all deferred rent due periodically by December 31, 2023. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. 10 When NNN deems the collection of rental income from a tenant not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. At this point, a tenant is deemed cash basis for accounting purposes. As a result of the review of rental income collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and no additional tenants were deemed as cash basis for accounting purposes. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of: September 30, 2022 2021 Number of tenants 8 11 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total Properties 5.2 % 5.6 % Total annual base rent (1) 7.1 % 7.1 % Total gross leasable area 6.8 % 7.4 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place for each respective period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN recognized $ 46,631,000 and $ 37,999,000 , respectively, of rental income from the tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes, of which $ 15,346,000 and $ 13,630,000 was recognized during the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 , three tenants were reclassified to accrual basis for accounting purposes due to their improved qualitative and/or quantitative credit factors. The impact of the reclassification was immaterial. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Real Estate – Held for Sale – Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , NNN had recorded real estate held for sale of $ 4,181,000 (one property) and $ 5,557,000 (two properties), respectively in real estate portfolio on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The two properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021 were sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. Real Estate Dispositions – When real estate is disposed, the related cost, accumulated depreciation or amortization and any accrued rental income from operating leases and the net investment from direct financing leases are removed from the accounts, and gains and losses from the dispositions are reflected in income. Gains from the disposition of real estate are generally recognized in accordance FASB, ASC 610-20, ""Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets"" (""ASC 610-20""), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by NNN with the real estate sold are met. 11 Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 1,633,000 and $ 2,023,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, net of $ 104,000 and $ 129,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the credit facility as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 38,145,000 , as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 11,075,000 and $ 9,262,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. The core principle of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"" (""ASU 2014-09""), is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. 12 Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 88,421 $ 82,933 $ 243,964 $ 212,543 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends — ( 4,485 ) — ( 13,455 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 88,421 78,448 243,964 199,088 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 135 ) ( 180 ) ( 471 ) ( 509 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 88,286 $ 78,268 $ 243,493 $ 198,579 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 177,881,613 175,607,905 176,510,417 175,530,702 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 246,116 ) ( 340,725 ) ( 292,433 ) ( 323,808 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 734,711 ) ( 637,738 ) ( 675,628 ) ( 596,868 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 176,900,786 174,629,442 175,542,356 174,610,026 Other dilutive securities 466,924 109,461 451,551 106,027 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 177,367,710 174,738,903 175,993,907 174,716,053 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income it distributes to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. As of September 30, 2022 , NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. 13 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2021 $ ( 14,956 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,770 (2) Ending balance, September 30, 2022 $ ( 13,186 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”) contains practical expedients for reference rate reform-related activities, including the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. In 2021, NNN elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. NNN continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding as of September 30, 2022 . Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year's consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform the 2022 presentation. 14 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At September 30, 2022, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years and consisted of 3,370 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,616,920 $ 2,527,483 Buildings and improvements 6,779,242 6,375,583 Leasehold interests 355 355 9,396,517 8,903,421 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,610,018 ) ( 1,470,062 ) 7,786,499 7,433,359 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 32,183 7,277 Accounted for using the operating method 7,818,682 7,440,636 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,429 3,653 Classified as held for sale 4,181 5,557 $ 7,826,292 $ 7,449,846 (1) Includes $ 21,543 and $ 8,979 in land for Properties under construction at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 15 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Rental income from operating leases $ 188,840 $ 175,833 $ 558,942 $ 522,787 Earned income from direct financing leases 148 154 449 469 Percentage rent 235 195 1,231 530 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,879 3,842 12,779 13,440 $ 193,102 $ 180,024 $ 573,401 $ 537,226 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN recognized ( $ 3,298,000 ) and ( $ 19,091,000 ), respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which ( $ 655,000 ) and ( $ 3,400,000 ) of such income, net of reserves was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Included in accrued rental income are the net impacts of the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayments from the lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN recorded ($ 4,710,000 ) and ($ 21,996,000 ) , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments, of which ($ 1,201,000 ) and ($ 4,294,000 ) was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,410 $ 15,335 Less: accumulated amortization ( 11,339 ) ( 10,821 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 4,071 $ 4,514 In-place leases $ 124,310 $ 122,069 Less: accumulated amortization ( 77,992 ) ( 73,345 ) In-place leases, net $ 46,318 $ 48,724 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,371 $ 41,705 Less: accumulated amortization ( 27,830 ) ( 27,447 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 13,541 $ 14,258 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, were $ 410,000 and $ 430,000 , respectively, of which $ 130,000 and $ 156,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, was $ 5,337,000 and $ 5,451,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,793,000 and $ 1,840,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 16 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 8 $ 5,889 27 $ 9,473 26 $ 10,656 53 $ 17,935 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 19 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of September 30, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 103,875 Less amount funded ( 53,726 ) Remaining commitment $ 50,149 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 971 $ 4,781 $ 7,221 $ 14,647 Number of Properties: Vacant 2 5 8 19 Occupied 1 2 6 10 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 17 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $ 900,000,000 to $ 1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 21,592,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.01 % during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 . The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2022, $ 47,500,000 was outstanding and $ 1,052,500,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement (see ""Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity"") and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000 % notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is a senior unsecured obligation of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each series of Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, up to but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $ 10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. 18 Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Preferred Stock – In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares ( 13,800,000 ) representing interests in its 5.200 % Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $ 25.00 per depositary share ($ 345,000,000 ), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $ 10,897,000 , representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2022 4,401,082 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 2,801,778 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 45.42 $ 35.35 Net proceeds $ 127,270 $ 1,061 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,879 $ 173 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 51,567 46,666 Net proceeds $ 2,258 $ 2,012 19 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 $ — $ 13,455 Per depositary share — 0.3250 — 0.9750 Common stock: Dividends 97,008 92,731 282,637 274,550 Per share 0.5500 0.5300 1.6100 1.5700 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In October 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5500 per share, which is payable in November 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2022 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. 20 The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 2052 September 2021 Two forward starting swaps 120,000 1,584 1,584 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of September 30, 2022, $13,186,000 remained in other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) $ 1,770,000 and $ 2,494,000 , respectively, of which $ 595,000 and $ 565,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,447,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at September 30, 2022 . Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,113,546,000 and $ 4,032,757,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. 21 Item 2.

Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2021 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of September 30, 2022, NNN owned 3,349 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 34,265,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.4 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2022. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the restaurant (including full and limited service) (18.4%), convenience store (16.7%), and automotive service (13.6%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 23 As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Property Portfolio remained at least 99 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 10 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN is included in ""Item 1. Business"" of NNN's 2021 Annual Report. Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business NNN and certain of NNN's tenants were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, during 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for rent originally due for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Substantially all deferred rent will come due periodically by December 31, 2023. The following table outlines the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayment of the COVID-19 rent deferral lease amendments (dollars in thousands): Deferred Scheduled Repayment Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Cumulative Total 2020 $ 33,594 $ 18,425 $ 52,019 91.7 % $ 3,239 $ 20 $ 3,259 5.7 % 5.7 % 2021 990 3,768 4,758 8.3 % 25,935 5,841 31,776 56.0 % 61.7 % 2022 — — — — 5,391 9,135 14,526 25.6 % 87.3 % 2023 — — — — 19 3,334 3,353 5.9 % 93.2 % 2024 — — — — — 1,932 1,932 3.4 % 96.6 % 2025 — — — — — 1,931 1,931 3.4 % 100.0 % $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 While NNN's rent collections have returned to pre-pandemic levels, NNN's operations and those of NNN's tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 25 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Number of properties 8 27 26 53 Gross leasable area (square feet) 96,000 220,000 271,000 523,000 Net sales proceeds $ 21,195 $ 30,522 $ 49,174 $ 70,971 Net gain $ 5,889 $ 9,473 $ 10,656 $ 17,935 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, total revenues increased as compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to the income generated from recently acquired Properties (see ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Percent Increase Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 189,223 $ 176,182 7.4 % $ 560,622 $ 523,786 7.0 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,879 3,842 1.0 % 12,779 13,440 (4.9 )% Rental income 193,102 180,024 7.3 % 573,401 537,226 6.7 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 369 333 10.8 % 1,132 1,920 (41.0 )% Total revenues $ 193,471 $ 180,357 7.3 % $ 574,533 $ 539,146 6.6 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase is primarily due to income generated from Property acquisitions and, to a lesser extent, scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. Property acquisitions include: 26 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Percent Increase Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 10,124 $ 11,077 (8.6 )% $ 30,906 $ 34,693 (10.9 )% Real estate 5,875 6,521 (9.9 )% 19,246 20,865 (7.8 )% Depreciation and amortization 56,388 50,976 10.6 % 166,512 151,831 9.7 % Leasing transaction costs 96 86 11.6 % 260 146 78.1 % Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 971 4,781 (79.7 )% 7,221 14,647 (50.7 )% Executive retirement costs 556 — NC 6,805 — NC Total operating expenses $ 74,010 $ 73,441 0.8 % $ 230,950 $ 222,182 3.9 % Interest and other income $ (33 ) $ (61 ) (45.9 )% $ (120 ) $ (159 ) (24.5 )% Interest expense 36,962 33,518 10.3 % 110,400 101,190 9.1 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — NC — 21,328 (100.0 )% Total other expenses $ 36,929 $ 33,457 10.4 % $ 110,280 $ 122,359 (9.9 )% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.2% 6.1% 5.4% 6.4% Real estate 3.0% 3.6% 3.3% 3.9% Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation costs resulting from executive retirement. Real Estate. Real estate expenses decreased primarily due to owning fewer vacant properties for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to Property acquisitions subsequent to September 30, 2021. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. 27 As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 971 $ 4,781 $ 7,221 $ 14,647 Number of Properties: Vacant 2 5 8 19 Occupied 1 2 6 10 For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive Retirement Costs. In April 2022, Julian (“Jay”) Whitehurst retired from employment with the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process and as previously announced in January 2022. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs in connection with the long-term incentive compensation related to Mr. Whitehurst’s retirement and transition agreement. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The following represents the primary changes in fixed rate long-term debt that impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000 ) 3.300 % April 2023 Issuance 2052 Notes September 2021 450,000 3.000 % April 2052 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 also includes $2,078,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes. In addition to the transactions outlined in the table above, the Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $21,592,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.01% for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to no weighted average outstanding balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon an early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. 28 Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund short-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2022, NNN had $3,277,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,052,500,000 available for future borrowings under its Credit Facility. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 465,271 $ 453,150 Used in investing activities (526,808 ) (384,156 ) Provided by (used in) financing activities (106,508 ) 207,296 Increase (decrease) (168,045 ) 276,290 Net cash at beginning of period 171,322 267,236 Net cash at end of period $ 3,277 $ 543,526 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, included the following significant transactions: 29 Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise; and (iv) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors). The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,810,117 $ 170 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 2,700,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,856,175 34,233 136,701 129,006 120,750 106,225 1,329,260 Credit Facility 47,500 — — — 47,500 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,713,792 $ 34,403 $ 146,648 $ 479,006 $ 568,250 $ 456,225 $ 4,029,260 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and debt costs. See ""Capital Structure"". (2) Interest calculation on mortgage and notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. See ""Capital Structure"". Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 19 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 103,875 Less amount funded (53,726 ) Remaining commitment $ 50,149 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of September 30, 2022, NNN owned 21 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of October 28, 2022, approximately less than one percent of total properties, and approximately less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to two tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. 30 Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes, and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 $ — $ 13,455 Per depositary share — 0.3250 — 0.9750 Common stock: Dividends 97,008 92,731 282,637 274,550 Per share 0.5500 0.5300 1.6100 1.5700 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In October 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5500 per share which is payable in November 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2022. C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt, to finance property acquisitions and to fund construction on its Properties. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2022 Percentage of Total December 31, 2021 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ 47,500 1.2 % $ — — Mortgages payable 10,151 0.3 % 10,697 0.3 % Notes payable 3,738,843 98.5 % 3,735,769 99.7 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,796,494 100.0 % $ 3,746,466 100.0 % Line of Credit Payable. In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility from $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $21,592,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.01% during the nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2022, $47,500,000 was outstanding and $1,052,500,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for NNN’s revolving Credit Facility. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that USD LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. This announcement has several implications, including setting the spread that may be used to automatically convert contracts from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""). Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, banks have ceased issuance of any new LIBOR based debt. NNN anticipates that LIBOR will continue to be available until June 30, 2023. For a discussion of the phase-out of LIBOR and its impact to NNN, see NNN's 2021 Annual Report. 31 Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's 2021 Annual Report. Debt Securities – Notes Payable. In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes""). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes (3) March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (4)(5) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (4) In October 2021, NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2052 Notes to redeem all of its 13,800,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series F preferred stock, with the remainder of the net proceeds used to fund property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (5) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each of the Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. As a part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. 32 Equity Securities Preferred Stock. In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (13,800,000) representing interests in its 5.200% Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share ($345,000,000), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $10,897,000, representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. As of September 30, 2022, NNN had no outstanding shares of preferred stock. At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2022 4,401,082 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 2,801,778 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 45.42 $ 35.35 Net proceeds $ 127,270 $ 1,061 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,879 $ 173 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 51,567 46,666 Net proceeds $ 2,258 $ 2,012 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates are included in NNN’s 2021 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 33 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the September 30, 2022, condensed consolidated financial statements. 34 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of September 30, 2022, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. As of September 30, 2022, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had $47,500,000 outstanding, a weighted average outstanding balance of $21,592,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.01% compared to no weighted average outstanding balance for the same period in 2021. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2022. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2022, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

(2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude unamortized discounts and debt costs. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2026. 35 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2022, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 36 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . June 30, 2022 Property Portfolio: Total Properties 3,305 Gross leasable area (square feet) 33,758,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.6 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2022. See ""Note 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2021, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2021 and 2020, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See ""Note 2 – Real Estate""). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 274,000 and $ 127,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, of which $ 176,000 and $ 64,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. 9 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN records right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 4,758,000 and $ 52,019,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 31,776,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2021 and approximately $ 8,076,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the six months ended June 30, 2022 . An additional $ 6,450,000 is due in 2022, with substantially all remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2023. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. When NNN deems the collection of rental income from a tenant not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. At this point, a tenant is deemed cash basis for accounting purposes. 10 As a result of the review of rental income collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, and no additional tenants were deemed as cash basis for accounting purposes. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of: June 30, 2022 2021 Number of tenants 8 11 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total Properties 5.3 % 6.0 % Total annual base rent 7.2 % 7.1 % Total gross leasable area 6.9 % 7.7 % During the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , NNN recognized $ 31,285,000 and $ 24,369,000 , respectively, of rental income from the tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes, of which $ 15,499,000 and $ 13,055,000 was recognized during the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2022 , three tenants were reclassified to accrual basis for accounting purposes due to their improved qualitative and/or quantitative credit factors. The impact of the reclassification was immaterial. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Real Estate – Held for Sale – Real estate held for sale is not depreciated and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, less cost to sell. Real Estate Dispositions – When real estate is disposed, the related cost, accumulated depreciation or amortization and any accrued rental income from operating leases and the net investment from direct financing leases are removed from the accounts, and gains and losses from the dispositions are reflected in income. Gains from the disposition of real estate are generally recognized in accordance FASB, ASC 610-20, ""Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets"" (""ASC 610-20""), provided that various criteria relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by NNN with the real estate sold are met. Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 1,734,000 and $ 2,023,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, net of $ 111,000 and $ 129,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. 11 Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the credit facility as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 38,145,000 , as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 10,465,000 and $ 9,262,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. The core principle of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"" (""ASU 2014-09""), is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 74,171 $ 73,023 $ 155,543 $ 129,610 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends — ( 4,485 ) — ( 8,970 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 74,171 68,538 155,543 120,640 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 165 ) ( 178 ) ( 319 ) ( 328 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 74,006 $ 68,360 $ 155,224 $ 120,312 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 175,989,323 175,590,102 175,813,456 175,491,461 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 310,844 ) ( 341,467 ) ( 300,810 ) ( 315,209 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 721,623 ) ( 637,738 ) ( 645,597 ) ( 576,094 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 174,956,856 174,610,897 174,867,049 174,600,158 Other dilutive securities 151,058 115,915 154,822 132,918 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 175,107,914 174,726,812 175,021,871 174,733,076 12 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income it distributed to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2021 $ ( 14,956 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,175 (2) Ending balance, June 30, 2022 $ ( 13,781 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”) contains practical expedients for reference rate reform-related activities, including the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. In 2021, NNN elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. NNN continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding as of June 30, 2022 . Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate asset purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 13 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At June 30, 2022, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years and consisted of 3,317 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,579,427 $ 2,527,483 Buildings and improvements 6,630,545 6,375,583 Leasehold interests 355 355 9,210,327 8,903,421 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,561,310 ) ( 1,470,062 ) 7,649,017 7,433,359 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 21,987 7,277 Accounted for using the operating method 7,671,004 7,440,636 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,504 3,653 $ 7,674,508 $ 7,444,289 (1) Includes $ 14,091 and $ 8,979 in land for Properties under construction at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 14 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Rental income from operating leases $ 185,791 $ 173,371 $ 370,102 $ 346,954 Earned income from direct financing leases 150 157 301 315 Percentage rent 295 231 996 335 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,300 4,245 8,900 9,598 $ 190,536 $ 178,004 $ 380,299 $ 357,202 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN recognized ( $ 2,643,000 ) and ( $ 15,692,000 ), respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which ( $ 1,547,000 ) and ( $ 7,359,000 ) of such income, net of reserves was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. Included in accrued rental income are the net impacts of the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayments from the lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , NNN recorded ($ 3,509,000 ) and ($ 17,706,000 ), respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments, of which ($ 1,729,000 ) and ($ 8,323,000 ) was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 29,065,000 and $ 31,942,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 4,090,000 and $ 4,587,000 , respectively. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,335 $ 15,335 Less: accumulated amortization ( 11,166 ) ( 10,821 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 4,169 $ 4,514 In-place leases $ 121,380 $ 122,069 Less: accumulated amortization ( 76,200 ) ( 73,345 ) In-place leases, net $ 45,180 $ 48,724 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,160 $ 41,705 Less: accumulated amortization ( 27,527 ) ( 27,447 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 13,633 $ 14,258 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , were $ 280,000 and $ 274,000 , respectively, of which $ 140,000 and $ 112,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , was $ 3,544,000 and $ 3,612,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,771,000 and $ 1,812,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 15 Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2022 December 31, 2021 (1) Land and improvements $ 2,313 $ 6,440 Building and improvements 5,306 4,313 7,619 10,753 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 2,393 ) ( 1,331 ) Less impairment ( 1,765 ) ( 3,865 ) $ 3,461 $ 5,557 Number of Properties 3 2 (1) The two properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021 were sold during the six months ended June 30, 2022. Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 8 $ 775 15 $ 4,181 18 $ 4,767 26 $ 8,462 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 15 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of June 30, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 81,315 Less amount funded ( 36,078 ) Remaining commitment $ 45,237 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. 16 Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 4,618 $ 7,735 $ 6,250 $ 9,866 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 8 6 14 Occupied 3 7 5 8 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $ 900,000,000 to $ 1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 9,028,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.04 % during the six months ended June 30, 2022 . The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2022, $ 40,000,000 was outstanding and $ 1,060,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 17 Note 4 – Notes Payable : In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement (see ""Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity"") and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000 % notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is a senior unsecured obligation of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each series of Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, up to but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $ 10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Preferred Stock – In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares ( 13,800,000 ) representing interests in its 5.200 % Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $ 25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $ 10,897,000 , representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2022 2,316,777 18 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 717,473 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 43.23 $ 37.05 Net proceeds $ 31,018 $ 1,111 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 575 $ 122 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 34,396 31,430 Net proceeds $ 1,456 $ 1,293 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 $ — $ 8,970 Per depositary share — 0.3250 — 0.6500 Common stock: Dividends 92,878 90,971 185,629 181,819 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 1.0600 1.0400 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In July 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5500 per share, which is payable in August 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of July 29, 2022 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. 19 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 2052 September 2021 Two forward starting swaps 120,000 1,584 1,584 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of June 30, 2022, $13,781,000 remained in other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) $ 1,175,000 and $ 1,929,000 , respectively, of which $ 592,000 and $ 561,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,422,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2022 . Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,336,524,000 and $ 4,032,757,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after June 30, 2022, the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. There were no reportable subsequent events or transactions. 20 Item 2.

These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of June 30, 2022, NNN owned 3,305 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 33,758,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of June 30, 2022. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the convenience store (17.0%), automotive service (13.1%) and restaurant (including full and limited service) (18.8%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 22 As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Property Portfolio remained at least 98 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN is included in ""Item 1. Business"" of NNN's 2021 Annual Report. Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business NNN and certain of NNN's tenants were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, during 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, which require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Substantially all remaining deferred rent will come due periodically by December 31, 2023. The following table outlines the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayment of the COVID-19 rent deferral lease amendments (dollars in thousands): Deferred Scheduled Repayment Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Cumulative Total 2020 $ 33,594 $ 18,425 $ 52,019 91.7 % $ 3,239 $ 20 $ 3,259 5.7 % 5.7 % 2021 990 3,768 4,758 8.3 % 25,935 5,841 31,776 56.0 % 61.7 % 2022 — — — — 5,391 9,135 14,526 25.6 % 87.3 % 2023 — — — — 19 3,334 3,353 5.9 % 93.2 % 2024 — — — — — 1,932 1,932 3.4 % 96.6 % 2025 — — — — — 1,931 1,931 3.4 % 100.0 % $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 While NNN's rent collections have returned to pre-pandemic levels, NNN's operations and those of NNN's tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 43 29 102 58 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 348,000 173,000 1,227,000 528,000 Initial cash yield 6.2 % 6.7 % 6.2 % 6.5 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 153,769 $ 102,935 $ 364,592 $ 208,561 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 24 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Number of properties 8 15 18 26 Gross leasable area (square feet) 94,000 207,000 175,000 303,000 Net sales proceeds $ 7,905 $ 22,874 $ 27,979 $ 40,449 Net gain $ 775 $ 4,181 $ 4,767 $ 8,462 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, total revenues increased as compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to scheduled rent increases and to the income generated from recently acquired Properties (see ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Percent Increase Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 186,236 $ 173,759 7.2 % $ 371,399 $ 347,604 6.8 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,300 4,245 1.3 % 8,900 9,598 (7.3 )% Rental income 190,536 178,004 7.0 % 380,299 357,202 6.5 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 247 1,007 (75.5 )% 763 1,587 (51.9 )% Total revenues $ 190,783 $ 179,011 6.6 % $ 381,062 $ 358,789 6.2 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The increase is primarily due to scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index and income generated from Property acquisitions: 25 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Percent Increase Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) 2022 2021 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 9,740 $ 11,868 (17.9 )% $ 20,782 $ 23,616 (12.0 )% Real estate 6,173 6,619 (6.7 )% 13,371 14,344 (6.8 )% Depreciation and amortization 57,444 50,875 12.9 % 110,124 100,855 9.2 % Leasing transaction costs 76 22 245.5 % 164 60 173.3 % Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 4,618 7,735 (40.3 )% 6,250 9,866 (36.7 )% Executive retirement costs 2,655 — N/C 6,249 — N/C Total operating expenses $ 80,706 $ 77,119 4.7 % $ 156,940 $ 148,741 5.5 % Interest and other income $ (52 ) $ (33 ) 57.6 % $ (87 ) $ (98 ) (11.2 )% Interest expense 36,739 33,085 11.0 % 73,438 67,672 8.5 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — N/C — 21,328 (100.0 )% Total other expenses $ 36,687 $ 33,052 11.0 % $ 73,351 $ 88,902 (17.5 )% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.1 % 6.6 % 5.5 % 6.6 % Real estate 3.2 % 3.7 % 3.5 % 4.0 % Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation costs resulting from executive retirement. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to Property acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2021. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. 26 As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 4,618 $ 7,735 $ 6,250 $ 9,866 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 8 6 14 Occupied 3 7 5 8 For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive retirement costs. In April 2022, Julian (“Jay”) Whitehurst retired from employment with the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process and as previously announced in January 2022. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs as a result of the accounting treatment for long-term incentive compensation related to Mr. Whitehurst’s Retirement and Transition Agreement. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The following represents the primary changes in fixed rate long-term debt that impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000 ) 3.300 % April 2023 Issuance 2052 Notes September 2021 450,000 3.000 % April 2052 In addition, interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 includes $2,078,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes. In addition to the transactions outlined in the table above, the Credit Facility had a weighted average balance outstanding balance of $9,028,000 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.04% for the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to no weighted average outstanding balance at June 30, 2021. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon an early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by 27 internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund short-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2022, NNN had $3,289,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,060,000,000 available for future borrowings under its Credit Facility. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of June 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 275,311 $ 280,756 Used in investing activities (329,456 ) (167,238 ) Used in financing activities (113,888 ) (131,196 ) Decrease (168,033 ) (17,678 ) Net cash at beginning of period 171,322 267,236 Net cash at end of period $ 3,289 $ 249,558 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations – Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2022, included the following significant transactions: 28 Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise; and (iv) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors). The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term debt outstanding as of June 30, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,810,283 $ 336 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 2,700,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,890,416 68,474 136,701 129,006 120,750 106,225 1,329,260 Credit Facility 40,000 — — — 40,000 — — Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,740,699 $ 68,810 $ 146,648 $ 479,006 $ 560,750 $ 456,225 $ 4,029,260 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and debt costs. See ""Capital Structure"". (2) Interest calculation on mortgage and notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. See ""Capital Structure"". Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 15 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at June 30, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 81,315 Less amount funded (36,078 ) Remaining commitment $ 45,237 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of June 30, 2022, NNN owned 30 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of July 28, 2022, NNN had no tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. 29 Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes, and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 $ — $ 8,970 Per depositary share — 0.3250 — 0.6500 Common stock: Dividends 92,878 90,971 185,629 181,819 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 1.0600 1.0400 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In July 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5500 per share which is payable in August 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of July 29, 2022. C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt, to finance property acquisitions and to fund construction on its Properties. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2022 Percentage of Total December 31, 2021 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ 40,000 1.0 % $ — — Mortgages payable 10,334 0.3 % 10,697 0.3 % Notes payable 3,737,808 98.7 % 3,735,769 99.7 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,788,142 100.0 % $ 3,746,466 100.0 % Line of Credit Payable. In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility from $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $9,028,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.04% during the six months ended June 30, 2022. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2022, $40,000,000 was outstanding and $1,060,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for NNN’s revolving Credit Facility. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that USD LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. This announcement has several implications, including setting the spread that may be used to automatically convert contracts from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""). Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, banks have ceased issuance of any new LIBOR based debt. NNN anticipates that LIBOR will continue to be available until June 30, 2023. For a discussion of the phase-out of LIBOR and its impact to NNN, see NNN's 2021 Annual Report. Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an 30 indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's 2021 Annual Report. Debt Securities – Notes Payable. In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes""). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes (3) March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (4)(5) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (4) In October 2021, NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2052 Notes to redeem all of its 13,800,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series F preferred stock, with the remainder of the net proceeds used to fund property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (5) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each of the Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. As a part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. 31 Equity Securities Preferred Stock. In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (13,800,000) representing interests in its 5.200% Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $10,897,000, representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. As of June 30, 2022, NNN had no outstanding shares of preferred stock. At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2022 2,316,777 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 717,473 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 43.23 $ 37.05 Net proceeds $ 31,018 $ 1,111 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 575 $ 122 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 34,396 31,430 Net proceeds $ 1,456 $ 1,293 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates are included in NNN’s 2021 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 32 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the June 30, 2022, condensed consolidated financial statements. 33 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of June 30, 2022, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, NNN's variable rate Credit Facility had $40,000,000 outstanding, a weighted average outstanding balance of $9,028,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.04% compared to no weighted average outstanding balance for the same period in 2021. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2022. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of June 30, 2022, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

(2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude unamortized discounts and debt costs. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2026. 34 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of June 30, 2022, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 35 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . March 31, 2022 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,271 Gross leasable area (square feet) 33,545,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.6 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2022. See ""Note 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2021, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. COVID-19 Pandemic – During 2021 and 2020, NNN and its tenants were impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus and its variants (""COVID-19"") pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See Note 2). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 98,000 and $ 63,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. 7 The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN records its leases on the Property Portfolio in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""). In addition, NNN recorded right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases in accordance with ASC 842. NNN's real estate is generally leased to tenants on a net lease basis, whereby the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses relating to the Property, including property taxes, insurance, maintenance, repairs and capital expenditures. The leases on the Property Portfolio are predominantly classified as operating leases and are accounted for as follows: Operating method – Properties with leases accounted for using the operating method are recorded at the cost of the real estate and depreciated on the straight-line method over their estimated remaining useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 15 years for land improvements. Leasehold interests are amortized on the straight-line method over the terms of their respective leases. Revenue is recognized as rentals are earned and expenses (including depreciation) are charged to operations as incurred. When scheduled rentals vary during the lease term, income is recognized on a straight-line basis so as to produce a constant periodic rent over the term of the lease. Accrued rental income is the aggregate difference between the scheduled rents which vary during the lease term and the income recognized on a straight-line basis. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 4,758,000 and $ 52,019,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 31,776,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2021 and approximately $ 4,063,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. An additional $ 10,463,000 is due in 2022, with substantially all remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2023. Collectability – In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its rental income on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future rental income collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of rental income not probable, uncollected previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed and, subsequently, any rental income is only recognized when cash receipts are received. 8 NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. As a result of the review of rental income collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, and no tenants were reclassified as cash basis for accounting purposes. The following table summarizes those tenants classified as cash basis for accounting purposes as of: March 31, 2022 2021 Number of tenants 9 12 Cash basis tenants as a percent of: Total properties 5.4 % 6.1 % Total gross leasable area 7.0 % 7.7 % During the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, NNN recognized $ 15,786,000 and $ 11,314,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants previously classified as cash basis for accounting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, two tenants were reclassified to accrual basis for accounting purposes due to their improved qualitative and/or quantitative credit factors. The impact of the reclassification was immaterial. Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 1,927,000 and $ 2,023,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , respectively, net of $ 123,000 and $ 129,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 unsecured revolving line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the credit facility as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 9 Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 38,145,000 , as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 9,859,000 and $ 9,262,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – Rental revenues for properties under construction commence upon completion of construction of the leased asset and delivery of the leased asset to the tenant. Rental revenues for non-development real estate assets are recognized when earned in accordance with ASC 842 , based on the terms of the lease of the leased asset. Lease termination fees are recognized when collected subsequent to the related lease that is cancelled and NNN no longer has continuing involvement with the former tenant with respect to that property. The core principle of ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"" (""ASU 2014-09""), is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of ASC 842. NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. In accordance with ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 81,372 $ 56,587 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends — ( 4,485 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 81,372 52,102 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 156 ) ( 151 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 81,216 $ 51,951 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 175,635,634 175,391,723 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 294,665 ) ( 288,658 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 568,726 ) ( 513,765 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 174,772,243 174,589,300 Other dilutive securities 138,970 125,317 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 174,911,213 174,714,617 Income Taxes – NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and related regulations. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income it distributed to stockholders, providing it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. For the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, NNN believes it has qualified as a REIT. Notwithstanding NNN’s qualification for taxation as a REIT, NNN is subject to certain state and local income, franchise and excise taxes. 10 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2021 $ ( 14,956 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 583 (2) Ending balance, March 31, 2022 $ ( 14,373 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”) contains practical expedients for reference rate reform-related activities, including the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts. The guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. In 2021, NNN elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. NNN continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance and may apply other elections as applicable as additional changes in the market occur. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding as of March 31, 2022 . Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate asset purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 11 Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At March 31, 2022, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years and consisted of 3,285 leases classified as operating leases and an additional five leases accounted for as direct financing leases. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index, (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the renewal options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,556,405 $ 2,527,483 Buildings and improvements 6,536,540 6,375,583 Leasehold interests 355 355 9,093,300 8,903,421 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,517,047 ) ( 1,470,062 ) 7,576,253 7,433,359 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 11,811 7,277 Accounted for using the operating method 7,588,064 7,440,636 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,579 3,653 $ 7,591,643 $ 7,444,289 (1) Includes $ 8,070 and $ 8,979 in land for Properties under construction at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. 12 NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Rental income from operating leases $ 184,311 $ 173,583 Earned income from direct financing leases 151 158 Percentage rent 701 104 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,600 5,353 $ 189,763 $ 179,198 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , NNN recognized ($ 1,206,000 ) and ($ 8,445,000 ), respectively, of accrued rental income, net of reserves. Included in accrued rental income are the impacts of the rent deferral lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , NNN recorded ($ 1,780,000 ) and ($ 9,381,000 ), respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments. At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 30,727,000 and $ 31,942,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 4,351,000 and $ 4,587,000 , respectively. Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,335 $ 15,335 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,993 ) ( 10,821 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 4,342 $ 4,514 In-place leases $ 121,431 $ 122,069 Less: accumulated amortization ( 74,480 ) ( 73,345 ) In-place leases, net $ 46,951 $ 48,724 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,160 $ 41,705 Less: accumulated amortization ( 27,214 ) ( 27,447 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 13,946 $ 14,258 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , were $ 140,000 and $ 162,000 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 , was $ 1,773,000 and $ 1,800,000 , respectively. 13 Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (1) Land and improvements $ 546 $ 6,440 Building and improvements 1,192 4,313 1,738 10,753 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 714 ) ( 1,331 ) Less impairment ( 462 ) ( 3,865 ) $ 562 $ 5,557 Number of Properties 2 2 (1) Both properties classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2021 were sold during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 10 $ 3,992 11 $ 4,281 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 13 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of March 31, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 38,889 Less amount funded 19,881 Remaining commitment $ 19,008 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. 14 Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 1,632 $ 2,131 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 6 Occupied 2 1 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $ 900,000,000 to $ 1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 . The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2022, there was no outstanding balance and $ 1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 15 Note 4 – Notes Payable : In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000 % notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is a senior unsecured obligation of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each series of Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, up to but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $ 10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : Universal Shelf Registration Statement – In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Preferred Stock – In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares ( 13,800,000 ) representing interests in its 5.200 % Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $ 25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $ 10,897,000 , representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2022 1,599,304 16 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Shares of common stock 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 38.59 Net proceeds $ 1,158 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 75 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 17,571 15,769 Net proceeds $ 748 $ 569 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 Per depositary share — 0.3250 Common stock: Dividends 92,751 90,848 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In April 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5300 per share, which is payable in May 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of April 29, 2022 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. 17 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 2052 September 2021 Two forward starting swaps 120,000 1,584 1,584 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of March 31, 2022 , $ 14,373,000 remained in other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) $ 583,000 and $ 1,368,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,398,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2022 . Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable excluding unamortized discount and debt costs was $ 3,624,822,000 and $ 4,032,757,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after March 31, 2022, the date of the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. There were no reportable subsequent events or transactions. 18 Item 2. Management’s Discussion a nd Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2021 (""2021 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.

Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2021 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of March 31, 2022, NNN owned 3,271 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 33,545,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of March 31, 2022. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest line of trade concentrations are the convenience store (17.5%), automotive service (12.6%) and restaurant (including full and limited service) (18.9%) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. As of March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Property Portfolio remained at least 98 percent leased and had a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 11 years. High occupancy levels coupled with a net lease structure, provides enhanced probability of maintaining operating earnings. Additional information related to NNN is included in ""Item 1. Business"" of NNN's 2021 Annual Report. 20 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business NNN and certain of NNN's tenants were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, during 2021 and 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, which require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Substantially all remaining deferred rent will come due periodically by December 31, 2023. The following table outlines the rent deferred and corresponding scheduled repayment of the COVID-19 rent deferral lease amendments (dollars in thousands): Deferred Scheduled Repayment Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Accrual Basis Cash Basis Total % of Total Cumulative Total 2020 $ 33,594 $ 18,425 $ 52,019 91.7 % $ 3,239 $ 20 $ 3,259 5.7 % 5.7 % 2021 990 3,768 4,758 8.3 % 25,935 5,841 31,776 56.0 % 61.7 % 2022 — — — — 5,391 9,135 14,526 25.6 % 87.3 % 2023 — — — — 19 3,334 3,353 5.9 % 93.2 % 2024 — — — — — 1,932 1,932 3.4 % 96.6 % 2025 — — — — — 1,931 1,931 3.4 % 100.0 % $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 $ 34,584 $ 22,193 $ 56,777 While NNN's rent collections have returned to pre-pandemic levels, NNN's operations and those of NNN's tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under the Credit Facility or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 22 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Number of properties 10 11 Gross leasable area (square feet) 81,000 96,000 Net sales proceeds $ 20,074 $ 17,575 Net gain $ 3,992 $ 4,281 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, total revenues increased as compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to scheduled rent increases and to the income generated from recently acquired Properties (See ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 185,163 $ 173,845 6.5 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,600 5,353 (14.1 )% Rental income 189,763 179,198 5.9 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 516 580 (11.0 )% Total revenues $ 190,279 $ 179,778 5.8 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. The increase is primarily due to scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index and the income generated from Property acquisitions: 23 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021, primarily due to the increase in executive retirement costs and depreciation and amortization. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase 2022 2021 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 11,042 $ 11,748 (6.0 )% Real estate 7,198 7,725 (6.8 )% Depreciation and amortization 52,680 49,980 5.4 % Leasing transaction costs 88 38 131.6 % Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 1,632 2,131 (23.4 )% Executive retirement costs 3,594 — N/C Total operating expenses $ 76,234 $ 71,622 6.4 % Interest and other income $ (35 ) $ (65 ) (46.2 )% Interest expense 36,699 34,587 6.1 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt — 21,328 (100.0 )% Total other expenses $ 36,664 $ 55,850 (34.4 )% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.8 % 6.5 % Real estate 3.8 % 4.3 % Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021, primarily due to Property acquisitions subsequent to March 31, 2021. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, with cash flows provided over the entire term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to the COVID-19 pandemic alone was determined not to be an indicator of impairment. 24 As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 1,632 $ 2,131 Number of Properties: Vacant 3 6 Occupied 2 1 For the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Executive retirement costs. In January 2022, as contemplated under the Company’s long-term executive succession planning process, NNN announced that Julian (“Jay”) Whitehurst will retire from employment with the Company as President and Chief Executive Officer on April 28, 2022. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, NNN recorded executive retirement costs as a result of the accounting treatment for long-term incentive compensation related to Mr. Whitehurst’s Retirement and Transition Agreement. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, as compared to the same periods in 2021. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000 ) 3.300 % April 2023 Issuance 2052 Notes September 2021 450,000 3.000 % April 2052 In addition, interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 includes $2,078,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. As part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon an early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Liquidity and Capital Resources NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Financing Strategy. NNN’s financing objective is to manage its capital structure effectively in order to provide sufficient capital to execute its operating strategy while servicing its debt requirements, maintaining its investment grade credit rating, staggering debt maturities and providing value to NNN’s stockholders. NNN’s capital resources have and will continue to include, if available (i) proceeds from the issuance of public or private equity or debt capital market transactions; (ii) secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders; (iii) proceeds from the sale of Properties; and (iv) to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds as well as undistributed funds from operations. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. NNN typically expects to fund short-term liquidity requirements, including investments in additional properties, with cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2022, NNN has $53,736,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,100,000,000 available for future borrowings under its Credit Facility. 25 Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 164,338 $ 161,170 Used in investing activities (189,643 ) (88,512 ) Used in financing activities (92,281 ) (28,663 ) Increase (decrease) (117,586 ) 43,995 Net cash at beginning of period 171,322 267,236 Net cash at end of period $ 53,736 $ 311,231 Cash flow activities include: Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Investing Activities. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties as discussed in ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis."" NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. Financing Activities. NNN’s financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2022, included the following significant transactions: Material Cash Requirements NNN's material cash requirements include (i) long-term debt maturities; (ii) interest on long-term debt; (iii) to a lesser extent, Property construction and other Property related costs that may arise; and (iv) common stock dividends (although all future distributions will be declared and paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors). The table below presents material cash requirements related to NNN's long-term debt outstanding as of March 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands): Date of Obligation Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,810,447 $ 500 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 350,000 $ 2,700,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,924,653 102,711 136,701 129,006 120,750 106,225 1,329,260 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,735,100 $ 103,211 $ 146,648 $ 479,006 $ 520,750 $ 456,225 $ 4,029,260 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. See ""Capital Structure"". (2) Interest calculation on mortgage and notes payable based on stated rate of the principal amount. See ""Capital Structure"". 26 Property Construction. NNN has committed to fund construction on 13 Properties. The improvements of such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at March 31, 2022, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 38,889 Less amount funded 19,881 Remaining commitment $ 19,008 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Properties. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, utilities, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of March 31, 2022, NNN owned 26 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of April 28, 2022, NNN had no tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. One of NNN’s primary objectives is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends, while retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes, and maintaining its status as a REIT. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,485 Per depositary share — 0.3250 Common stock: Dividends 92,751 90,848 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 (1) The Series F preferred stock was redeemed in October 2021. In April 2022, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5300 per share which is payable in May 2022 to its common stockholders of record as of April 29, 2022. 27 C apital Structure NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, various forms of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down or refinance its outstanding debt, to finance property acquisitions and to fund construction on its Properties. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2022 Percentage of Total December 31, 2021 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 10,515 0.3 % $ 10,697 0.3 % Notes payable 3,736,781 99.7 % 3,735,769 99.7 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,747,296 100.0 % $ 3,746,466 100.0 % Line of Credit Payable. In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility from $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2022. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, loan costs are classified as debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of March 31, 2022, there was no outstanding balance and $1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for NNN’s revolving Credit Facility. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that USD LIBOR will no longer be published after June 30, 2023. This announcement has several implications, including setting the spread that may be used to automatically convert contracts from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""). Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, banks have ceased issuance of any new LIBOR based debt. NNN anticipates that LIBOR will continue to be available until June 30, 2023. For a discussion of the phase-out of LIBOR and its impact to NNN, see NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Universal Shelf Registration Statement. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Debt Securities – Notes Payable. In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes (3) March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (4)(5) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (4) In October 2021, NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2052 Notes to redeem all of its 13,800,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series F preferred stock, with the remainder of the net proceeds used to fund property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (5) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. 28 Each series of Notes is senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each of the Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. As a part of NNN's financing strategy, NNN may opt to redeem outstanding notes payable prior to the original maturity date. Upon early redemption, notes are redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023 with a make-whole amount of $21,328,000. The make-whole amount is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income. Equity Securities Preferred Stock. In October 2021, NNN redeemed all outstanding depositary shares (13,800,000) representing interests in its 5.200% Series F preferred stock. The Series F preferred stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.111944 per depositary share. The excess carrying amount of the Series F preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F preferred stock was $10,897,000, representing issuance costs which is reflected as a reduction to earnings attributable to common stockholders. As of March 31, 2022, NNN had no outstanding shares of preferred stock. At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2020 ATM Established date August 2020 Termination date August 2023 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2022 1,599,304 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Shares of common stock 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 38.59 Net proceeds $ 1,158 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 75 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2022 2021 Shares of common stock 17,571 15,769 Net proceeds $ 748 $ 569 29 Critical Accounting Estimates The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The preparation of NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as other disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and assumptions; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions, which in turn could have a material impact on NNN’s consolidated financial statements. A summary of NNN’s critical accounting estimates are included in NNN’s 2021 Annual Report. NNN has not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the March 31, 2022, condensed consolidated financial statements. 30 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate long-term debt which is used to finance NNN’s Property acquisitions and development activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt and periodically uses derivatives to hedge the interest rate risk of future borrowings. As of March 31, 2022, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. NNN's variable rate Credit Facility: The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding. The table presents, by year of expected maturity, principal payments and related interest rates for debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2022. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of March 31, 2022, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would remain unchanged for the quarter ended March 31, 2022. Debt Obligations (dollars in thousands) Fixed Rate Debt Mortgages (1) Unsecured Debt (2) Principal Debt Obligation Weighted Average Interest Rate Principal Debt Obligation Effective Interest Rate 2022 $ 500 5.23 % $ — — 2023 9,947 5.23 % — — 2024 — — 350,000 3.92 % 2025 — — 400,000 4.03 % 2026 — — 350,000 3.73 % Thereafter — — 2,700,000 3.57 % (3) Total $ 10,447 5.23 % $ 3,800,000 3.69 % Fair Value: March 31, 2022 $ 10,447 $ 3,624,822 December 31, 2021 $ 10,611 $ 4,032,757 (1) NNN's mortgages payable represent principal payments by year and exclude both unamortized premiums and debt costs. (2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude unamortized discounts and debt costs. The fair value is based upon quoted market prices as of the close of the period, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded on the over-the-counter market. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2026. 31 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer (""NNN's Chief Officers""), of the effectiveness as of March 31, 2022, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, NNN's Chief Officers concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . September 30, 2021 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,195 Gross leasable area (square feet) 33,005,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.6 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. See ""Note 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2020, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. COVID-19 Pandemic – During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, NNN and its tenants continue to be impacted by the novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") pandemic which has resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See Note 2). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 215,000 and $ 1,218,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, of which $ 87,000 and $ 332,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building 11 and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), NNN recorded Right-Of-Use assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases. In July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, which affects lessors with lease contracts that (i) have variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or a rate and (ii) would have resulted in the recognition of a selling loss at lease commencement if classified as sales-type or direct financing. NNN has reviewed all existing leases and determined this update has no effect on the current portfolio, but will apply ASU 2021-05 prospectively to leases that commence or are modified in the future. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021. In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, and no tenants were reclassified as cash basis for accounting purposes. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. As of September 30, 2021 , approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately seven percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to 11 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , NNN recognized $ 37,999,000 and $ 930,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting, of which $ 13,630,000 and $ 726,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively . Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are 12 currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 2,117,000 and $ 2,482,000 , respectively, included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 135,000 and $ 158,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the line of credit as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 38,145,000 and $ 31,140,000 , as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 8,670,000 and $ 9,317,000 , respectively. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 13 The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 82,933 $ 56,069 $ 212,543 $ 167,512 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 13,455 ) ( 13,455 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 78,448 51,584 199,088 154,057 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 180 ) ( 179 ) ( 509 ) ( 516 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 78,268 $ 51,405 $ 198,579 $ 153,541 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 175,607,905 173,596,374 175,530,702 172,579,042 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 340,725 ) ( 344,429 ) ( 323,808 ) ( 332,730 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 637,738 ) ( 570,809 ) ( 596,868 ) ( 539,735 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 174,629,442 172,681,136 174,610,026 171,706,577 Other dilutive securities 109,461 101,130 106,027 108,800 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 174,738,903 172,782,266 174,716,053 171,815,377 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: 14 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2020 $ ( 16,445 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 1,584 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 2,494 (2) Net other comprehensive income (loss) 910 Ending balance, September 30, 2021 $ ( 15,535 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate asset purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At September 30, 2021, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years and consisted of 3,187 leases classified as operating leases and an additional six leases accounted for as direct financing. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. As of September 30, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 4,758,000 and $ 52,019,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 3,259 ,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $ 6,068 ,000 and $ 27,087 ,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. An additional $ 4,689 ,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2025. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. 15 Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,533,379 $ 2,489,243 Buildings and improvements 6,331,216 6,009,797 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,864,950 8,499,395 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,434,760 ) ( 1,317,407 ) 7,430,190 7,181,988 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 8,551 26,673 Accounted for using the operating method 7,438,741 7,208,661 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,732 3,994 $ 7,442,473 $ 7,212,655 (1) Includes $ 8,844 and $ 8,421 in land for Properties under construction at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Rental income from operating leases $ 175,833 $ 153,825 $ 522,787 $ 481,858 Earned income from direct financing leases 154 161 469 487 Percentage rent 195 160 530 728 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,842 3,719 13,440 12,818 $ 180,024 $ 157,865 $ 537,226 $ 495,891 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , NNN recognized ($ 19,427 ,000) and $ 33,022 ,000, respectively, of accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which ($ 3,509 ,000) and $ 2,305 ,000 of such income, net of reserves, was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in accrued rental income are the impacts of the rent deferral lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , NNN recorded ($ 21,996 ,000) and $ 38,938 ,000, respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments, of which ($ 4,294 ,000) and $ 8,499 ,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 34,341 ,000 and $ 53,958 ,000, respectively, net of allowance of $ 4,922 ,000 and $ 6,947 ,000, respectively. 16 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,389 $ 15,474 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,699 ) ( 10,271 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 4,690 $ 5,203 In-place leases $ 123,470 $ 118,416 Less: accumulated amortization ( 72,510 ) ( 68,695 ) In-place leases, net $ 50,960 $ 49,721 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,932 $ 41,101 Less: accumulated amortization ( 27,217 ) ( 26,486 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 14,715 $ 14,615 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , were $ 430 ,000 and $ 711 ,000, respectively, of which $ 156 ,000 and $ 301 ,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , was $ 5,451 ,000 and $ 6,364 ,000, respectively, of which $ 1,840 ,000 and $ 2,027 ,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of September 30, 2021 , NNN had five of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2020 , included five Properties, all of which were sold in 2021 . Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements $ 9,272 $ 3,841 Building and improvements 14,463 4,971 23,735 8,812 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 4,249 ) ( 2,536 ) Less impairment ( 9,777 ) ( 605 ) $ 9,709 $ 5,671 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 27 $ 9,473 3 $ 148 53 $ 17,935 25 $ 13,637 17 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 10 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of September 30, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 39,122 Less amount funded 17,395 Remaining commitment $ 21,727 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 4,781 $ 5,695 $ 14,647 $ 33,062 Number of Properties: Vacant 5 1 19 10 Occupied 2 — 10 13 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 18 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $ 900,000,000 to $ 1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2021 . The Credit Facility matures in June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, NNN incurred loan costs of $ 7,439,000 which are included in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $ 1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000 % notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (3) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives . Each series of Notes is a senior unsecured obligation of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each series of Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon, up to but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $ 10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. 19 At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 30,000 1,634,350 Average price per share (net) $ 35.35 $ 36.56 Net proceeds $ 1,061 $ 59,752 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 173 $ 1,151 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 46,666 121,988 Net proceeds $ 2,012 $ 4,458 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 $ 13,455 $ 13,455 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 0.9750 0.9750 Common stock: Dividends 92,731 89,947 274,550 266,365 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 1.5700 1.5500 (1) In September 2021, NNN called for the redemption of all outstanding shares of its 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), including all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, on October 16, 2021 . In October 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5300 per share, which is payable in November 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of October 29, 2021 . 20 Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 2052 September 2021 Two forward starting swaps 120,000 1,584 1,584 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of September 30, 2021 , $ 15,535 ,000 remained in other comprehensive income (loss) related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss) $ 2,494 ,000 and $ 1,663 ,000 , respectively, of which $ 565 ,000 and $ 642 ,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,349,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at September 30, 2021 . 21 Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 4,026,563,000 and $ 3,532,908,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after September 30, 2021, the date of the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of October 27, 2021, NNN had collected approximately 99 % of rent originally due in the quarter ended September 30, 2021 and 99 % of rent originally due in October 2021. In September 2021, NNN announced the redemption of all outstanding depository shares representing interests in its 5.200 % Series F Preferred Stock. The depository shares were redeemed on October 16, 2021 at $ 25.00 per depository share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 25.111944 per depository share. For the quarter ending December 31, 2021, NNN will record a preferred stock redemption charge of $ 10,897,000 , which is the excess carrying amount of the preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series F Preferred Stock. On the redemption date, dividends on the depository shares representing interest in the Series F Preferred Stock ceased to accrue. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 22 Item 2. Management’s Discussion a nd Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020 (""2020 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of September 30, 2021, NNN owned 3,195 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 33,005,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2021. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 24 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it negatively affected almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants experienced temporary closures of their operations and/or requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, NNN and certain of NNN's tenants continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the continued loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As of September 30, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $4,758,000 and $52,019,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $6,068,000 and $27,087,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. An additional $4,689,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2025. The following table details the rental revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 (collected as of October 27, 2021), as a percentage of annualized base rent, excluding the repayments of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments : Lines of Trade % of Total Annual Base Rent (1) % of Rent Collected (2) 1. Convenience stores 17.6 % 99.8 % 2. Automotive service 12.1 % 99.7 % 3. Restaurants – full service 9.9 % 94.7 % 4. Restaurants – limited service 9.0 % 99.7 % 5.

(2) As of October 27, 2021, NNN has collected approximately 99% of rent originally due in October 2021. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. 25 NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments. As of September 30, 2021 , NNN had $543,526,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,100,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility"") . NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. The rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

Property Acquisitions. The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 49 — 107 21 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 561,000 15,000 1,090,000 299,000 Initial cash yield 6.4 % — 6.5 % 6.8 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 246,843 $ 3,880 $ 455,404 $ 77,971 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under the Credit Facility (See ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 27 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Number of properties 27 3 53 25 Gross leasable area (square feet) 220,000 26,000 523,000 315,000 Net sales proceeds $ 30,522 $ 2,414 $ 70,971 $ 42,498 Net gain $ 9,473 $ 148 $ 17,935 $ 13,637 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, total revenues increased as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a change in receivables reserves, scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") and to the income generated from Properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (See ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase Percent Increase 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2021 2020 (Decrease) Rental Revenues (1) $ 176,182 $ 154,146 14.3 % $ 523,786 $ 483,073 8.4 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,842 3,719 3.3 % 13,440 12,818 4.9 % Rental income 180,024 157,865 14.0 % 537,226 495,891 8.3 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 333 768 (56.6 )% 1,920 1,506 27.5 % Total revenues $ 180,357 $ 158,633 13.7 % $ 539,146 $ 497,397 8.4 % (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021 is primarily due to a change in receivables reserves, scheduled rent increases based on increases in the CPI and Property acquisitions: 28 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses which was partially offset by a decrease in impairment losses recognized on real estate. Operating expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the decrease in impairment losses recognized on real estate which was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase Percent Increase 2021 2020 (Decrease) 2021 2020 (Decrease) General and administrative $ 11,077 $ 9,419 17.6 % $ 34,693 $ 28,914 20.0 % Real estate 6,521 6,345 2.8 % 20,865 20,304 2.8 % Depreciation and amortization 50,976 49,404 3.2 % 151,831 147,528 2.9 % Leasing transaction costs 86 — N/C 146 36 305.6 % Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 4,781 5,695 (16.0 )% 14,647 33,062 (55.7 )% Total operating expenses $ 73,441 $ 70,863 3.6 % $ 222,182 $ 229,844 (3.3 )% Interest and other income $ (61 ) $ (74 ) (17.6 )% $ (159 ) $ (345 ) (53.9 )% Interest expense 33,518 31,924 5.0 % 101,190 97,347 3.9 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — N/C 21,328 16,679 27.9 % Total other expenses $ 33,457 $ 31,850 5.0 % $ 122,359 $ 113,681 7.6 % As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 6.1 % 5.9 % 6.4 % 5.8 % Real estate 3.6 % 4.0 % 3.9 % 4.1 % Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same periods in 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in incentive compensation costs. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. 29 As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 4,781 $ 5,695 $ 14,647 $ 33,062 Number of Properties: Vacant 5 1 19 10 Occupied 2 — 10 13 For the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably possible to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the same periods in 2020. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000 ) 3.800 % October 2022 Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000 ) 3.300 % April 2023 Issuance 2052 Notes September 2021 450,000 3.000 % April 2052 In addition to the note payable transactions outlined in the table above, interest expense was impacted due to the Credit Facility having no weighted average outstanding balance for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to a $25,239,000 weighted average outstanding balance with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 includes $2,078,000 and $2,291,000, respectively, in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. While the total impacts of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2021, NNN has $543,526,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,100,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. NNN anticipates its long-term capital needs will be funded by the Credit Facility, cash provided from operations, the issuance of long-term debt or the issuance of common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for 30 common or preferred equity. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 453,150 $ 348,824 Used in investing activities (384,156 ) (48,569 ) Provided by (used in) financing activities 207,296 (6,507 ) Increase 276,290 293,748 Net cash at beginning of period 267,236 1,112 Net cash at end of period $ 543,526 $ 294,860 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, included the following significant transactions: (i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following: (ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds: (iii) Dividends paid: 31 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2021. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2021. Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,810,772 $ 161 $ 664 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 3,050,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,993,131 34,242 136,947 136,701 129,006 120,750 1,435,485 Headquarters office lease (3) 2,870 198 804 821 837 210 — Ground leases (4) 7,455 146 582 582 601 639 4,905 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,814,228 $ 34,747 $ 138,997 $ 148,051 $ 480,444 $ 521,599 $ 4,490,390 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. See ""Debt-Notes Payable"". (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. (3) NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease. (4) NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 10 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 39,122 Less amount funded 17,395 Remaining commitment $ 21,727 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of September 30, 2021, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to items reflected in the tables, in October 2021, NNN redeemed all of its 13,800,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series F Preferred Stock. Additional disclosure is included in Note 8 - Subsequent Events. Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its Credit Facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its Credit Facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or the inability to collect lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of September 30, 2021, NNN owned 46 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of October 27, 2021, NNN had no tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 32 NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the Rental Revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes, and property and liability insurance. The ongoing development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 $ 13,455 $ 13,455 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 0.9750 0.9750 Common stock: Dividends 92,731 89,947 274,550 266,365 Per share 0.5300 0.5200 1.5700 1.5500 (1) In September 2021, NNN called for the redemption of all outstanding shares of its 5.200% Series F Preferred Stock, including all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, on October 16, 2021. In October 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5300 per share which is payable in November 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of October 29, 2021. 33 Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt NNN expects to use debt primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally, debt may be used to refinance existing debt. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2021 Percentage of Total December 31, 2020 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 10,875 0.3 % $ 11,395 0.4 % Notes payable 3,734,764 99.7 % 3,209,527 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,745,639 100.0 % $ 3,220,922 100.0 % Line of Credit Payable. In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility from $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, NNN incurred loan costs of $7,439,000 which are included in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September 30, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Notes Payable. In 2021, NNN filed prospectus supplements to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) and $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.000% notes due April 2052 (the ""2052 Notes"" and, together with the 2051 Notes, the ""Notes"" ). Each note issuance is summarized in the table below (dollar in thousands): Notes Issue Date Principal Discount (1) Net Price Stated Rate Effective Rate (2) Maturity Date 2051 Notes (3) March 2021 $ 450,000 $ 8,406 $ 441,594 3.500 % 3.602 % April 2051 2052 Notes (4)(5) September 2021 450,000 10,422 439,578 3.000 % 3.118 % April 2052 (1) The note discounts are amortized to interest expense over the respective term of each debt obligation using the effective interest method. (2) Includes the effects of the discount at issuance. (3) NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (4) In October 2021, NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2052 Notes to redeem all of its 13,800,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series F Preferred Stock. Additional disclosure is included in Note 8 – Subsequent Events. In addition, we intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering to fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. (5) NNN entered into forward swaps which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt. Upon the issuance of the 2052 Notes, NNN terminated such derivatives, and the resulting fair value was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. Each series of Notes is senior, unsecured obligations of NNN and is subordinated to all secured debt of NNN and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Each of the Notes is redeemable at NNN's option, at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal amount of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest 34 thereon, but not including the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture related to the notes. In connection with the Notes, NNN incurred debt issuance costs totaling $10,144,000 consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses. Debt issuance costs for all note issuances have been deferred and presented as a reduction to notes payable and are being amortized over the term of the respective notes using the effective interest method. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 30,000 1,634,350 Average price per share (net) $ 35.35 $ 36.56 Net proceeds $ 1,061 $ 59,752 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 173 $ 1,151 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement that was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits NNN to issue up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 46,666 121,988 Net proceeds $ 2,012 $ 4,458 35 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the September 30, 2021, condensed consolidated financial statements. 36 Item 3. Quantitative and Q ualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of September 30, 2021, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2021. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest rate for the Credit Facility for year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2021, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would remain unchanged for the nine months ended September 30, 2021.

(2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts. NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2025. 37 Item 4. Controls a nd Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2021, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . June 30, 2021 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,173 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,664,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.6 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. See ""Footnote 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2020, included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. COVID-19 Pandemic – During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, NNN and its tenants continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See Note 2). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 127,000 and $ 886,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of which $ 64,000 and $ 420,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the renewal option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), NNN recorded Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021. In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent are reversed and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, and no tenants were reclassified as cash basis for accounting purposes. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. As of June 30, 2021, approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately eight percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to 11 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NNN recognized $ 24,369,000 and $ 203,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting, of which $ 13,055,000 was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. No rental income from such tenants was recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Impairment – Real Estate – NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 2,210,000 and $ 2,482,000 , respectively, included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 141,000 and $ 158,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN's $ 1,100,000,000 line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the line of credit as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 33,177,000 and $ 31,140,000 , as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 8,102,000 and $ 9,317,000 , respectively. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 73,023 $ 46,265 $ 129,610 $ 111,443 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 8,970 ) ( 8,970 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 68,538 41,780 120,640 102,473 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 178 ) ( 176 ) ( 328 ) ( 336 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 68,360 $ 41,604 $ 120,312 $ 102,137 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 175,590,102 172,301,757 175,491,461 172,064,786 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 341,467 ) ( 342,079 ) ( 315,209 ) ( 326,816 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 637,738 ) ( 570,809 ) ( 576,094 ) ( 524,027 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 174,610,897 171,388,869 174,600,158 171,213,943 Other dilutive securities 115,915 96,416 132,918 159,873 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 174,726,812 171,485,285 174,733,076 171,373,816 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2021, (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2020 $ ( 16,445 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,929 (2) Net other comprehensive income (loss) 1,929 Ending balance, June 30, 2021 $ ( 14,516 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate asset purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At June 30, 2021, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years and consisted of 3,158 leases classified as operating leases and an additional six leases accounted for as direct financing. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. As of June 30, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 51,799,000 and $ 4,758,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 3,259,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $ 10,416,000 and $ 21,151,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. An additional $ 10,889,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2025. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. 11 Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,503,718 $ 2,489,243 Buildings and improvements 6,154,976 6,009,797 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,659,049 8,499,395 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,394,185 ) ( 1,317,407 ) 7,264,864 7,181,988 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 1,841 26,673 Accounted for using the operating method 7,266,705 7,208,661 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,808 3,994 $ 7,270,513 $ 7,212,655 (1) Includes $ 5,222 and $ 8,421 in land for Properties under construction at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Rental income from operating leases $ 173,371 $ 159,300 $ 346,954 $ 328,033 Earned income from direct financing leases 157 162 315 326 Percentage rent 231 165 335 568 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,245 3,852 9,598 9,099 $ 178,004 $ 163,479 $ 357,202 $ 338,026 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NNN recognized ($ 15,918,000 ) and $ 30,717,000 , respectively, of accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which ($ 7,473,000 ) and $ 30,894,000 of such income, net of reserves, was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in accrued rental income are the impacts of the rent deferral lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NNN recorded ($ 17,706,000 ) and $ 26,015,000 , respectively, of net straight-line accrued rental income related to such amendments, of which ($ 8,323,000 ) and $ 26,015,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the balance of accrued rental income was $ 37,870,000 and $ 53,958,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 5,294,000 and $ 6,947,000 , respectively. 12 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,389 $ 15,474 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,525 ) ( 10,271 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 4,864 $ 5,203 In-place leases $ 121,951 $ 118,416 Less: accumulated amortization ( 70,671 ) ( 68,695 ) In-place leases, net $ 51,280 $ 49,721 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,373 $ 41,101 Less: accumulated amortization ( 26,887 ) ( 26,486 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 14,486 $ 14,615 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, were $ 274,000 and $ 410,000 , respectively, of which $ 112,000 and $ 190,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, was $ 3,612,000 and $ 4,337,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,812,000 and $ 1,942,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of June 30, 2021, NNN had 11 of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2020, included five Properties, all of which were sold in 2021. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements $ 14,860 $ 3,841 Building and improvements 17,018 4,971 31,878 8,812 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 5,659 ) ( 2,536 ) Less impairment ( 13,483 ) ( 605 ) $ 12,736 $ 5,671 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 15 $ 4,181 8 $ 719 26 $ 8,462 22 $ 13,489 13 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 11 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of June 30, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 17,555 Less amount funded 7,063 Remaining commitment $ 10,492 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $ 7,735 $ 21,854 $ 9,866 $ 27,367 Number of Properties: Vacant 8 2 14 9 Occupied 7 12 8 13 The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 14 Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $ 900,000,000 to $ 1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the ""Credit Facility""). The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 2,000,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, NNN incurred loan costs of $ 7,419,000 which are included in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of June 30, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $ 1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In March 2021, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”). The 2051 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 441,594,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2021. The discount of $ 8,406,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2051 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.602 %. The 2051 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured debt and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or in part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated March 10, 2021, relating to the 2051 Notes. NNN received approximately $ 436,417,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2051 Notes, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 5,177,000 for the 2051 Notes. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 15 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 30,000 1,417,977 Average price per share (net) $ 37.05 $ 36.68 Net proceeds $ 1,111 $ 52,018 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 122 $ 746 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 31,430 33,246 Net proceeds $ 1,293 $ 1,321 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 $ 8,970 $ 8,970 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 0.6500 0.6500 Common stock: Dividends 90,971 88,270 181,819 176,418 Per share 0.5200 0.5150 1.0400 1.0300 (1) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5300 per share, which is payable in August 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of July 30, 2021. Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. 16 For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of June 30, 2021, $ 14,516,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 1,929,000 and $ 1,021,000 , respectively, of which $ 561,000 and $ 638,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,295,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2021. Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,604,605,000 and $ 3,532,908,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after June 30, 2021, the date of the interim condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of July 28, 2021, NNN had collected approximately 99 % of rent originally due in the quarter ended June 30, 2021 and 99 % of rent originally due in July 2021. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 17 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020 (""2020 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Also, when NNN uses any of the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” or similar expressions, NNN is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, NNN’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statement: • Changes in financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants, and commercial real estate in general; • An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"")), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the other risks, and may significantly disrupt NNN's tenants' ability to operate their businesses and/or pay rent to NNN or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period; • Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; • A significant portion of NNN's annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; • NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; • NNN may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy; • Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; • Competition from numerous other real estate investment trusts (“REIT”), commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede NNN’s ability to grow; • Uninsured losses may adversely affect NNN's operating results and asset values; • NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased properties may be limited; • Vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; • Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, employees, capital providers, and other third parties; • Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks; • NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default of or bankruptcy of a tenant or a borrower; • Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; • NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; • The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; • NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; • NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; • Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; • NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; • NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and risks, including but not limited to liabilities and risks resulting from the existence of hazardous materials on or under properties owned by NNN; • NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; • Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; • The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; 18 • The cost of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; • Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results; • NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; • NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; • Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect NNN's properties, the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; • Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; • The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; • The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under NNN's variable rate debt; • Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; and • Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities. Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2020 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of June 30, 2021, NNN owned 3,173 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,664,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years. Approximately 98 percent of the Properties were leased as of June 30, 2021. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 19 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it negatively affected almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants experienced temporary closures of their operations and/or requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, NNN and certain of NNN's tenants continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the continued loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As of June 30, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for an aggregate $51,799,000 and $4,758,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $10,416,000 and $21,151,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, respectively. An additional $10,889,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent coming due periodically by December 31, 2025. The following table details the rental revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2021 (collected as of July 28, 2021), as a percentage of annualized base rent, excluding the repayments of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments : % of Total Annual Base Rent (1) % of Rent Collected (2) 1. Convenience stores 18.0 % 99.9 % 2. Automotive service 11.4 % 99.7 % 3. Restaurants – full service 9.9 % 93.9 % 4. Restaurants – limited service 9.2 % 99.7 % 5. Family entertainment centers 6.1 % 99.9 % 6. Health and fitness 5.2 % 99.3 % 7. Theaters 4.6 % 94.9 % 8. Recreational vehicle dealers, parts and accessories 3.5 % 100.0 % 9. Equipment rental 3.2 % 100.0 % 10. Automotive parts 3.1 % 100.0 % 11. Home improvement 2.6 % 100.0 % 12. Wholesale clubs 2.5 % 100.0 % 13. Medical service providers 2.2 % 98.6 % 14. General merchandise 1.7 % 98.7 % 15. Furniture 1.6 % 99.5 % 16. Consumer electronics 1.6 % 100.0 % 17. Home furnishings 1.6 % 100.0 % 18. Travel plazas 1.5 % 100.0 % 19. Drug stores 1.4 % 100.0 % 20. Bank 1.3 % 100.0 % Other 7.8 % 98.6 % Total 100.0 % 98.9 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of June 30, 2021. (2) As of July 28, 2021, NNN has collected approximately 99% of rent originally due in July 2021. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and their impact on a tenant's business and operations, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. 20 NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments. As of June 30, 2021 , NNN had $249,558,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,100,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility. NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. The rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 29 — 58 21 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 173,000 67,000 528,000 284,000 Initial cash yield 6.7 % — 6.5 % 6.9 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 102,935 $ 6,894 $ 208,561 $ 74,091 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (See ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 22 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Number of properties 15 8 26 22 Gross leasable area (square feet) 207,000 113,000 303,000 289,000 Net sales proceeds $ 22,874 $ 3,818 $ 40,449 $ 40,084 Net gain $ 4,181 $ 719 $ 8,462 $ 13,489 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, total revenues increased as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a change in receivables reserves, scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") and to the income generated from Properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020 and six months ended June 30, 2021 (See ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 2021 2020 Rental Revenues (1) $ 173,759 $ 159,627 8.9% $ 347,604 $ 328,927 5.7% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,245 3,852 10.2% 9,598 9,099 5.5% Rental income 178,004 163,479 8.9% 357,202 338,026 5.7% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 1,007 222 353.6% 1,587 738 115.0% Total revenues $ 179,011 $ 163,701 9.4% $ 358,789 $ 338,764 5.9% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021 is primarily due to a change in receivables reserves, scheduled rent increases based on increases in the CPI and Property acquisitions: (i) a partial year of Rental Revenue from 58 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 528,000 square feet during 2021, and (ii) a full year of Rental Revenue from 63 Properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet in 2020. 23 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses decreased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the decrease in impairment losses recognized on real estate which was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 2021 2020 General and administrative $ 11,868 $ 9,395 26.3% $ 23,616 $ 19,495 21.1% Real estate 6,619 6,323 4.7% 14,344 13,959 2.8% Depreciation and amortization 50,875 48,936 4.0% 100,855 98,124 2.8% Leasing transaction costs 22 — N/C 60 36 66.7% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 7,735 21,854 (64.6)% 9,866 27,367 (63.9)% Total operating expenses $ 77,119 $ 86,508 (10.9)% $ 148,741 $ 158,981 (6.4)% Interest and other income $ (33) $ (106) (68.9)% $ (98) $ (271) (63.8)% Interest expense 33,085 31,753 4.2% 67,672 65,423 3.4% Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — — 21,328 16,679 27.9% Total other expenses $ 33,052 $ 31,647 4.4% $ 88,902 $ 81,831 8.6% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 6.6 % 5.7 % 6.6 % 5.8 % Real estate 3.7 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.1 % Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount however, remained flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in long-term incentive compensation costs. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN periodically assesses its long-lived real estate assets for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These indicators include, but are not limited to: changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, properties reclassified as held for sale, persistent vacancies greater than one year, and properties leased to tenants in bankruptcy. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. 24 As a result of NNN's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries as summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Total real estate impairments, net of recoveries $7,735 $21,854 $9,866 $27,367 Number of Properties: Vacant 8 2 14 9 Occupied 7 12 8 13 For the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, real estate impairments, net of recoveries, was less than one percent of NNN's total assets for the respective periods as reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Due to NNN's core business of investing in real estate leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases, the inherent risks of owning commercial real estate, and unknown potential changes in financial and economic conditions that may impact NNN's tenants, NNN believes it is reasonably likely to incur real estate impairment charges in the future. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000) 3.800 % October 2022 Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000) 3.300 % April 2023 In addition to the note payable transactions outlined in the table above, interest expense was impacted due to the Credit Facility having no weighted average outstanding balance at June 30, 2021 compared to a $37,998,000 weighted average outstanding balance with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 includes $2,078,000 and $2,291,000, respectively, in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable that were due in April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable that were due in October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000 which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income and Comprehensive Income, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. While the total impacts of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2021, NNN has $249,558,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $1,100,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. 25 NNN anticipates its long-term capital needs will be funded by the Credit Facility, cash provided from operations, the issuance of long-term debt or the issuance of common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash, including cash held in escrow as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 280,756 $ 187,717 Used in investing activities (167,238) (41,472) Provided by (used in) financing activities (131,196) 77,203 Increase (decrease) (17,678) 223,448 Net cash at beginning of period 267,236 1,112 Net cash at end of period $ 249,558 $ 224,560 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters and six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2021, included the following significant transactions: (i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following: • $436,417,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.500% notes payable due in April 2051; • $350,000,000 payment in March for the early redemption of the 3.300% notes payable due in April 2023; and • $21,328,000 payment in March of the make-whole amount from the early redemption of the 3.300% notes payable due in April 2023. (ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds: • $1,111,000 from the issuance of 30,000 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (""ATM"") equity program; and • $1,293,000 from the issuance of 31,430 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""). (iii) Dividends paid: • $181,819,000 to common stockholders; and • $8,970,000 to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""). 26 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of June 30, 2021. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of June 30, 2021. Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,360,929 $ 318 $ 664 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 2,600,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,611,689 61,737 123,447 123,201 115,506 107,250 1,080,548 Headquarters office lease (3) 3,068 396 804 821 837 210 — Ground leases (4) 7,600 291 582 582 601 639 4,905 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,983,286 $ 62,742 $ 125,497 $ 134,551 $ 466,944 $ 508,099 $ 3,685,453 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. See ""Debt-Notes Payable"". (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. (3) NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease. (4) NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 11 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at June 30, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 17,555 Less amount funded 7,063 Remaining commitment $ 10,492 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of June 30, 2021, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of June 30, 2021, NNN owned 53 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately two percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of July 29, 2021, NNN had no tenants currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could 27 force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the Rental Revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes, and property and liability insurance. The ongoing development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Series F Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 $ 8,970 $ 8,970 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 0.6500 0.6500 Common stock: Dividends 90,971 88,270 181,819 176,418 Per share 0.5200 0.5150 1.0400 1.0300 (1) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5300 per share which is payable in August 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of July 30, 2021. Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt NNN expects to use debt primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally, debt may be used to refinance existing debt. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2021 Percentage of Total December 31, 2020 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 11,049 0.3 % $ 11,395 0.4 % Notes payable 3,299,218 99.7 % 3,209,527 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,310,267 100.0 % $ 3,220,922 100.0 % 28 Line of Credit Payable. In June 2021, NNN amended and restated its credit agreement to increase the borrowing capacity under its unsecured revolving credit facility from $900,000,000 to $1,100,000,000 and amended certain other terms under the former revolving credit facility (as the context requires, the previous and new revolving credit facility, the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance during the six months ended June 30, 2021. The Credit Facility matures June 2025, unless the Company exercises its options to extend maturity to June 2026. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. Additionally, as part of NNN's environmental, social and governance (""ESG"") initiative, pricing may be reduced if specified ESG metrics are achieved. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $2,000,000,000, subject to lender approval. In connection with the Credit Facility, NNN incurred loan costs of $7,419,000 which are included in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of June 30, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $1,100,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Notes Payable. In March 2021, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2021, issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”). The 2051 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $441,594,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2021. The discount of $8,406,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2051 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.602%. The 2051 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured debt and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the 2051 Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated March 10, 2021, relating to the 2051 Notes. NNN received approximately $436,417,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2051 Notes after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $5,177,000. NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable due April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. 29 At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 30,000 1,417,977 Average price per share (net) $ 37.05 $ 36.68 Net proceeds $ 1,111 $ 52,018 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 122 $ 746 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 31,430 33,246 Net proceeds $ 1,293 $ 1,321 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the June 30, 2021, condensed consolidated financial statements. 30 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of June 30, 2021, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2021. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest rate for the Credit Facility for year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of June 30, 2021, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would remain unchanged for the six months ended June 30, 2021.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of June 30, 2021, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . March 31, 2021 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,161 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,717,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.6 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021. See ""Footnote 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2020 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. COVID-19 Pandemic – During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, NNN and its tenants continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants (See Note 2). Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 63,000 and $ 466,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), NNN recorded Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities as lessee under operating leases. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the year ended December 31, 2020 and the quarter ended March 31, 2021. In accordance with ASC 842, NNN reviews the collectability of its lease payments on an ongoing basis. NNN considers collectability indicators when analyzing accounts receivable (and accrued rent) and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends, all of which assists in evaluating the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, previously recognized rental revenue and any related accrued rent is reversed and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of lease payments collectability, no outstanding receivables and related accrued rent were written off during the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and no tenants were reclassified as cash basis for accounting purposes. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. As of March 31, 2021, approximately six percent of total Properties, and approximately eight percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to 12 tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue on a cash basis. During the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, NNN recognized $ 11,314,000 and $ 203,000 , respectively, of rental income from certain tenants for periods following their classification to cash basis for accounting. Impairment – Real Estate – Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”) requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. As of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, NNN had mortgages receivable of $ 2,395,000 and $ 2,482,000 , respectively, included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 153,000 and $ 158,000 allowance for credit loss, respectively. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 33,177,000 and $ 31,140,000 , as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 7,543,000 and $ 9,317,000 , respectively. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 56,587 $ 65,178 Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 52,102 60,693 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 151 ) ( 160 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 51,951 $ 60,533 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 175,391,723 171,827,815 Less: Unvested restricted shares ( 288,658 ) ( 311,553 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 513,765 ) ( 477,245 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 174,589,300 171,039,017 Other dilutive securities 125,317 192,811 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 174,714,617 171,231,828 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2020 $ ( 16,445 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,368 (2) Net other comprehensive income (loss) 1,368 Ending balance, March 31, 2021 $ ( 15,077 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Additional critical accounting policies of NNN include management’s estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and are required to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant accounting policies include management’s estimates of the useful lives used in calculating depreciation expense relating to real estate asset purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets and management's evaluation of the probability of outstanding and future lease payment collections. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – At March 31, 2021, NNN’s real estate portfolio had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years and consisted of 3,150 leases classified as operating leases and an additional six leases accounted for as direct financing. The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. As of March 31, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants, for an aggregate $ 51,269,000 and $ 4,677,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $ 3,259,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $ 10,817,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. An additional $ 21,107,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent to be collected periodically by December 31, 2025. 9 Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on the macroeconomic conditions and the impact on tenants, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN's real estate consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,501,471 $ 2,489,243 Buildings and improvements 6,098,338 6,009,797 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,600,164 8,499,395 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,358,764 ) ( 1,317,407 ) 7,241,400 7,181,988 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 4,309 26,673 Accounted for using the operating method 7,245,709 7,208,661 Accounted for using the direct financing method 3,904 3,994 $ 7,249,613 $ 7,212,655 (1) Includes $ 2,328 and $ 8,421 in land for Properties under construction at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Rental income from operating leases $ 173,583 $ 168,733 Earned income from direct financing leases 158 164 Percentage rent 104 403 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 5,353 5,247 $ 179,198 $ 174,547 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020, NNN recognized accrued rental income, net of reserves and write-offs of ($ 177,000 ). During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, NNN recognized accrued rental income, net of reserves and write-offs of ($ 8,445,000 ), which includes ($ 9,385,000 ) of net straight-line accrued rent from rent deferral repayments related to the impacts of the rent deferral lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the balance of accrued rental income was $ 45,450,000 and $ 53,958,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 6,030,000 and $ 6,947,000 , respectively. 10 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,408 $ 15,474 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,327 ) ( 10,271 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 5,081 $ 5,203 In-place leases $ 121,486 $ 118,416 Less: accumulated amortization ( 68,986 ) ( 68,695 ) In-place leases, net $ 52,500 $ 49,721 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,077 $ 41,101 Less: accumulated amortization ( 26,559 ) ( 26,486 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 14,518 $ 14,615 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, were $ 162,000 and $ 220,000 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, were $ 1,800,000 and $ 2,395,000 , respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of March 31, 2021, NNN had five of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2020, included five Properties, four of which were sold in 2021. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Land and improvements $ 4,313 $ 3,841 Building and improvements 5,480 4,971 9,793 8,812 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 2,316 ) ( 2,536 ) Less impairment ( 979 ) ( 605 ) $ 6,498 $ 5,671 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 11 $ 4,281 14 $ 12,770 11 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on eight Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of March 31, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 12,077 Less amount funded 6,637 Remaining commitment $ 5,440 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 2,131,000 and $ 5,513,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") had no weighted average outstanding balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of March 31, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $ 900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In March 2021, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and issued $ 450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500 % notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”). The 2051 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 441,594,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2021. The discount of $ 8,406,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2051 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.602 %. The 2051 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured debt and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the 12 redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated March 10, 2021, relating to the 2051 Notes. NNN received approximately $ 436,417,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2051 Notes, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 5,177,000 for the 2051 Notes. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $ 350,000,000 3.300 % notes payable due April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 21,328,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. At-The-Market Offerings – Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): 2021 Shares of common stock 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 38.59 Net proceeds $ 1,158 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 75 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 15,769 12,528 Net proceeds $ 569 $ 696 13 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Series F preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 Common stock: Dividends 90,848 88,148 Per share 0.5200 0.5150 (1) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.5200 per share, which is payable in May 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2021. Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. 14 The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps $ 225,000 $ 6,312 $ 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of March 31, 2021, $ 15,077,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 1,368,000 and $ 383,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,271,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2021. Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,502,237,000 and $ 3,532,908,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after March 31, 2021, the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of April 28, 2021, NNN had collected approximately 97 % of rent originally due in the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and 98 % of rent originally due in April 2021. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 15 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2020 (""2020 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Also, when NNN uses any of the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” or similar expressions, NNN is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, NNN’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statement: • Changes in financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants, and commercial real estate in general; • An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"")), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the other risks, and may significantly disrupt NNN's tenants' ability to operate their businesses and/or pay rent to NNN or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period; • Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; • A significant portion of NNN's annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; • NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; • NNN may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy; • Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; • Competition from numerous other real estate investment trusts (“REIT”), commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede NNN’s ability to grow; • Uninsured losses may adversely affect NNN's operating results and asset values; • NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased properties may be limited; • Vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; • Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, employees, capital providers, and other third parties; • Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks; • NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default of or bankruptcy of a tenant or a borrower; • Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; • NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; • The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; • NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; • NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; • Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; • NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; • NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and risks, including but not limited to liabilities and risks resulting from the existence of hazardous materials on or under Properties owned by NNN; • NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; • Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; • The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; 16 • The cost of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; • Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results; • NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; • NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; • Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect NNN's properties, the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; • Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; • The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; • The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under NNN's variable rate debt; • Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; and • Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities. Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2020 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated REIT formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of March 31, 2021, NNN owned 3,161 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,717,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.6 years. Approximately 98 percent of the Properties were leased as of March 31, 2021. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 17 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government reaction to it negatively affected almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants experienced temporary closures of their operations and/or requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. As a result, these economic hardships have increased uncertainty with respect to the collectability of lease payments and have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances and recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, NNN and certain of NNN's tenants continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in the continued loss of revenue for certain tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As of March 31, 2021, NNN has entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants for an aggregate $51,269,000 and $4,677,000 of rent originally due for the years ending December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The rent deferral lease amendments require the deferred rents to be repaid at a later time during the lease term. Approximately $3,259,000 of deferred rent was repaid in 2020 and approximately $10,817,000 of deferred rent was repaid during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. An additional $21,107,000 is due in 2021, with the remaining deferred rent to be collected periodically by December 31, 2025. The following table details the rental revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (collected as of April 28, 2021), excluding the repayments of amounts previously deferred according to the rent deferral lease amendments as a percentage of annualized base rent : % of Total Annual Base Rent (1) % of Rent Collected (2) 1. Convenience stores 18.0 % 99.9 % 2. Automotive service 10.7 % 98.7 % 3. Restaurants - full service 10.2 % 91.5 % 4. Restaurants – limited service 9.5 % 99.9 % 5.

Bank 1.3 % 100.0 % Other 8.4 % 99.7 % Total 100.0 % 97.5 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of March 31, 2021. (2) As of April 28, 2021, NNN has collected approximately 98% of rent originally due in April 2021. Historical rent collections and rent relief requests may not be indicative of collections and requests in the future. Depending on the macroeconomic conditions and the impact on tenants, deferred rents may be difficult to collect. NNN will continue to monitor the impact of the economic downturn, among other things, when considering new property investments in 2021. As of March 31, 2021, NNN had $311,231,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available 18 for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility. NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. The rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows .

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 29 21 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 355,000 217,000 Initial cash yield 6.4 % 6.9 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 105,626 $ 67,197 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (See ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Number of properties 11 14 Gross leasable area (square feet) 96,000 176,000 Net sales proceeds $ 17,575 $ 36,266 Net gain $ 4,281 $ 12,770 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter ended March 31, 2021, total revenues increased as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to scheduled rent increases based on increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") and to the income generated from Properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020 and quarter ended March 31, 2021 (See ""Results of Operations - Property Analysis - Property Acquisitions""). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 Rental Revenues (1) $ 173,845 $ 169,300 2.7% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 5,353 5,247 2.0% Rental income 179,198 174,547 2.7% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 580 516 12.4% Total revenues $ 179,778 $ 175,063 2.7% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, is primarily due to scheduled rent increases and Property acquisitions: (i) a partial year of Rental Revenue from 29 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 355,000 square feet during 2021, and (ii) a full year of Rental Revenue from 63 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 449,000 square feet in 2020. 20 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses decreased for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the decrease in impairment losses recognized on real estate which was partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2021 2020 General and administrative $ 11,748 $ 10,100 16.3% Real estate 7,725 7,635 1.2% Depreciation and amortization 49,980 49,188 1.6% Leasing transaction costs 38 36 5.6% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 2,131 5,513 (61.3)% Total operating expenses $ 71,622 $ 72,472 (1.2)% Interest and other income $ (65) $ (164) (60.4)% Interest expense 34,587 33,670 2.7% Loss on early extinguishment of debt 21,328 16,679 27.9% Total other expenses $ 55,850 $ 50,185 11.3% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 6.5 % 5.8 % Real estate 4.3 % 4.4 % Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in long-term incentive compensation costs. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. Future cash flow estimates are sensitive to the assumptions made by management regarding future market rents, which are affected by expectations about future market and economic conditions. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN generally intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $2,131,000 and $5,513,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 21 Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, as compared to the same period in 2020. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000) 3.800 % October 2022 Issuance 2051 Notes March 2021 450,000 3.500 % April 2051 Redemption 2023 Notes March 2021 (350,000) 3.300 % April 2023 In addition to the note payable transactions outlined in the table above, interest expense was impacted due to the Credit Facility having no weighted average outstanding balance at March 31, 2021 compared to a $75,996,000 weighted average outstanding balance with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. In addition, interest expense for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 includes $2,078,000 and $2,291,000, respectively, in connection with the early redemption of the 2023 Notes and 2022 Notes, respectively. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable due April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. While the total impacts of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN expects to meet short-term liquidity requirements through cash and cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and NNN's Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2021, NNN has $311,231,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. NNN anticipates its long-term capital needs will be funded by the Credit Facility, cash provided from operations, the issuance of long-term debt or the issuance of common or preferred equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for common or preferred equity. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available, or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to NNN. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash, including cash held in escrow as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 161,170 $ 128,084 Used in investing activities (88,512) (30,654) Provided by (used in) financing activities (28,663) 118,841 Increase 43,995 216,271 Net cash at beginning of period 267,236 1,112 Net cash at end of period $ 311,231 $ 217,383 22 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarters ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2021, included the following significant transactions: (i) Issuance and redemption of notes payable resulted in the following: • $436,417,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.500% notes payable due in April 2051; • $350,000,000 payment in March for the early redemption of the 3.300% notes payable due in April 2023; and • $21,328,000 payment in March of the make-whole amount from the early redemption of the 3.300% notes payable due in April 2023. (ii) Issuance of common stock resulted in the following net proceeds: • $1,158,000 from the issuance of 30,000 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (""ATM"") equity program; and • $569,000 from the issuance of 15,769 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""). (iii) Dividends paid: • $90,848,000 to common stockholders; and • $4,485,000 to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""). Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2021. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2021. Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,361,085 $ 474 $ 664 $ 9,947 $ 350,000 $ 400,000 $ 2,600,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,642,562 92,610 123,447 123,201 115,506 107,250 1,080,548 Headquarters office lease (3) 3,266 594 804 821 837 210 — Ground leases (4) 7,741 432 582 582 601 639 4,905 Total contractual cash obligations $ 5,014,654 $ 94,110 $ 125,497 $ 134,551 $ 466,944 $ 508,099 $ 3,685,453 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. See ""Debt-Notes Payable"". (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. (3) NNN is a lessee for its headquarters office lease. (4) NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on eight Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at March 31, 2021, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 12,077 Less amount funded 6,637 Remaining commitment $ 5,440 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. 23 As of March 31, 2021, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures or major repairs. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of March 31, 2021, NNN owned 55 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately two percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of April 28, 2021, less than one percent of total Properties, and less than one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio was leased to one tenant that is currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm its lease with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged continuation of business closures, reduced capacity at businesses or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN's real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes, and property and liability insurance. The ongoing development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. 24 The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Series F Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,485 $ 4,485 Per depositary share 0.3250 0.3250 Common stock: Dividends 90,848 88,148 Per share 0.5200 0.5150 (1) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2021, NNN declared a dividend of $0.5200 per share which is payable in May 2021 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2021. Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt NNN expects to use debt primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally, debt may be used to refinance existing debt. The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2021 Percentage of Total December 31, 2020 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 11,222 0.3 % $ 11,395 0.4 % Notes payable 3,298,302 99.7 % 3,209,527 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,309,524 100.0 % $ 3,220,922 100.0 % Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had no weighted average outstanding balance during the quarter ended March 31, 2021. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. As of March 31, 2021, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Notes Payable. In March 2021, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its August 2020 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2021, issued $450,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.500% notes due April 2051 (the “2051 Notes”). The 2051 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $441,594,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2021. The discount of $8,406,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2051 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.602%. The 2051 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured debt and to the debt and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the 2051 Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, 25 for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated March 10, 2021, relating to the 2051 Notes. NNN received approximately $436,417,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2051 Notes after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $5,177,000. NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2051 Notes to redeem all of its 3.300% notes payable that were due 2023, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In March 2021, NNN redeemed the $350,000,000 3.300% notes payable due April 2023. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $21,328,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding debt and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. At-The-Market Offerings. Under NNN's shelf registration statement, NNN established an ATM equity program which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2021 1,599,304 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per share data): 2021 Shares of common stock 30,000 Average price per share (net) $ 38.59 Net proceeds $ 1,158 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 75 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2021, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 6,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2021 2020 Shares of common stock 15,769 12,528 Net proceeds $ 569 $ 696 26 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the March 31, 2021, condensed consolidated financial statements. 27 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of March 31, 2021, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2021. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of March 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The weighted average interest rate for the Credit Facility for year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.6%. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of March 31, 2021, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would remain unchanged for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.

(2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts. NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2025. 28 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of March 31, 2021, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 29 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . September 30, 2020 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,114 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,421,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.7 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020. See ""Footnote 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2019 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. COVID-19 Pandemic – On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. Although various states have lifted or modified certain restrictions, the initial actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including recognizing revenue on a cash basis from certain of its tenants. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the business closures or other social-distancing practices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain tenants have requested adjustments to their lease terms, primarily consisting of short-term deferrals of 30 to 90 days of rent. NNN is negotiating terms with these tenants that would require the deferred rental revenues to be paid at a later time in the lease term, typically over 3 to 18 months with payment beginning in fourth quarter 2020. Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. Rent collections and rent relief requests for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. NNN has materially curtailed new property investments in 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. Business Continuity The full extent of the effects of the economic downturn on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See Item ""1A. Risk Factors."" As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its associates to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor did this transition have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 1,218,000 and $ 797,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $ 332,000 and $ 327,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842"") , NNN reviews the collectability of its accounts receivable, including accrued rental income, related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probability of collection. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. NNN includes an allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. As a result of the review of tenant receivables’ collectability, NNN recorded a write-off of $ 14,758,000 of outstanding receivables and related accrued rent during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, and subsequently reclassified certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, NNN recognized revenue on a cash basis of $ 2,203,000 and $ 2,406,000 , respectively. NNN did no t recognize revenue on a cash basis during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, approximately four percent of total Properties, and approximately six percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to six tenants that NNN has determined to recognize revenue from on a cash basis. In accordance with ASC 842, NNN recorded Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN has elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 31,140,000 and $ 26,932,000 , as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 8,705,000 and $ 8,962,000 , respectively. Impairment – Real Estate – Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are currently vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – Effective January 1, 2020, NNN adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”). The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 326 requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The new guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. As of September 30, 2020, NNN had a mortgage receivable of $ 2,569,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 164,000 allowance for credit loss. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Adoption of ASC 326 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 56,069 $ 66,693 $ 167,512 $ 225,394 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends — ( 4,097 ) — ( 12,291 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 13,455 ) ( 13,455 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 51,584 58,111 154,057 199,648 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 179 ) ( 163 ) ( 516 ) ( 412 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 51,405 $ 57,948 $ 153,541 $ 199,236 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 173,596,374 165,737,947 172,579,042 163,421,419 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 344,429 ) ( 316,856 ) ( 332,730 ) ( 272,185 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 570,809 ) ( 537,582 ) ( 539,735 ) ( 507,973 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 172,681,136 164,883,509 171,706,577 162,641,261 Other dilutive securities 101,130 478,222 108,800 484,802 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 172,782,266 165,361,731 171,815,377 163,126,063 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2019 $ ( 11,128 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 7,617 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,663 (2) Net other comprehensive income (loss) ( 5,954 ) Ending balance, September 30, 2020 $ ( 17,082 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (""ASU 2019-12""), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 will not have a significant impact on NNN's financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates – Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: September 30, 2020 Lease classification: Operating 3,109 Direct financing 6 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.7 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of September 30, 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants representing approximately 6 % of the annual rent originally due for the year ending December 31, 2020. On 11 average, 2.7 months of rent was deferred with approximately 77 % of deferred rent originally due in the second quarter of 2020 and 23 % originally due in the third quarter of 2020. Approximately 66 % of this deferred rent is due to be paid to NNN by June 30, 2021 and 89 % is due by December 31, 2021. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,479,994 $ 2,491,073 Buildings and improvements 5,937,116 5,916,425 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,417,465 8,407,853 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,276,495 ) ( 1,147,918 ) 7,140,970 7,259,935 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 27,022 27,439 $ 7,167,992 $ 7,287,374 (1) Includes $ 9,449 and $ 16,930 in land for Properties under construction at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Rental income from operating leases $ 153,825 $ 163,674 $ 481,858 $ 482,306 Earned income from direct financing leases 161 204 487 624 Percentage rent 160 329 728 1,051 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,719 4,017 12,818 11,865 $ 157,865 $ 168,224 $ 495,891 $ 495,846 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, NNN recognized $ 33,022,000 and $ 1,354,000 , respectively, of accrued rental income, net of reserves, of which $ 2,305,000 and $ 429,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in accrued rental income are the impacts of the rent deferral lease amendments NNN entered into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, NNN recorded $ 8,499,000 and $ 38,938,000 of net accrued rental income related to such amendments. Additionally, as a result of reclassifying certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes during the third quarter of 2020, NNN wrote-off approximately $ 11,393,000 of accrued rental income for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the balance of accrued rental income was $ 61,754,000 and $ 28,897,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 7,978,000 and $ 1,842,000 , respectively. 12 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,828 $ 15,754 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,444 ) ( 9,897 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 5,384 $ 5,857 In-place leases $ 119,868 $ 119,846 Less: accumulated amortization ( 68,208 ) ( 64,918 ) In-place leases, net $ 51,660 $ 54,928 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,786 $ 41,767 Less: accumulated amortization ( 26,358 ) ( 26,135 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 15,428 $ 15,632 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, were $ 711,000 and $ 579,000 , respectively of which $ 301,000 and $ 178,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, were $ 6,364,000 and $ 5,946,000 , respectively, of which $ 2,027,000 and $ 1,904,000 was recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of September 30, 2020, NNN had three of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2019, included eight Properties, five of which were sold in 2020. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements $ 3,703 $ 6,908 Building and improvements 4,695 7,610 8,398 14,518 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 2,386 ) ( 3,750 ) Less impairment ( 604 ) ( 1,107 ) $ 5,408 $ 9,661 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 3 $ 148 13 $ 2,061 25 $ 13,637 43 $ 25,508 13 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on seven Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of September 30, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 47,424 Less amount funded 36,471 Remaining commitment $ 10,953 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 33,062,000 and $ 21,124,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $ 5,695,000 and $ 10,692,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by the 2020 Amendment (as defined below), the ""Credit Facility"") had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 25,239,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.6 % during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations (""2020 Amendment""). As of September 30, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $ 900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $ 400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500 % notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $ 300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100 % notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536 %. NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 200,000,000 . Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $ 13,141,000 , which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The loss is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. 14 The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205 %. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $ 395,062,000 and $ 290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 3,650,000 and $ 3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $ 325,000,000 3.800 % notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 16,679,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 121,988 309,127 Net proceeds $ 4,458 $ 16,481 At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2020 84,501 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 1,634,350 2,344,022 Average price per share (net) $ 36.56 $ 53.73 Net proceeds $ 59,752 $ 125,946 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,151 $ 1,390 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. 15 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Series E preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,097 $ — $ 12,291 Per depositary share — 0.356250 — 1.068750 Series F preferred stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 13,455 13,455 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.975000 0.975000 Common stock: Dividends 89,947 83,935 266,365 245,574 Per share 0.520 0.515 1.550 1.515 (1) The 5.700 % Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In October 2020, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.52 per share, which is payable in November 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of October 30, 2020. Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. 16 The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2023 April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of September 30, 2020, $ 17,082,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 1,663,000 and $ 975,000 , respectively, of which $ 642,000 and $ 327,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,574,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at September 30, 2020. Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,437,058,000 and $ 3,074,538,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after September 30, 2020, the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the economic downturn which presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business, financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. As of October 28, 2020, NNN had collected approximately 90 % of rent originally due in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and 94 % of rent originally due in October 2020. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 17 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Also, when NNN uses any of the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” or similar expressions, NNN is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, NNN’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statement: • Changes in financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants, and commercial real estate in general; • An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the other risks, and may significantly disrupt NNN's tenants' ability to operate their businesses and/or pay rent to NNN or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period; • Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; • A significant portion of NNN's annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; • NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; • NNN may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy; • Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; • Competition from numerous other REITs, commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede NNN's ability to grow; • NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; • Uninsured losses may adversely affect NNN's operating results and asset values; • NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased properties may be limited; • Vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; • NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; • Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, employees, capital providers, and other third parties; • Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks; • NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default of or bankruptcy of a tenant or a borrower; • Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; • Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; • Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; • NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; • The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; • NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; • The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; • NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; • The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under NNN's variable rate debt; 18 • Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; • NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; • NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and hazardous materials on Properties owned by NNN; • The cost of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; • NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; • Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; • Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities; • Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; • The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; and • Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results. Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2019 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of September 30, 2020, NNN owned 3,114 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,421,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.7 years. Approximately 98 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2020. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 19 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business Overview On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. Although various states have lifted certain restrictions, the initial actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances. NNN has materially curtailed new property investments in 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of October 28, 2020, NNN had collected approximately 90% of rent originally due in the quarter ended September 30, 2020 and 94% of rent originally due in October 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of September 30, 2020, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants representing approximately 6% of the annual rent originally due for the year ending December 31, 2020. On average, 2.7 months of rent was deferred with approximately 77% of deferred rent originally due in the second quarter of 2020 and 23% originally due in the third quarter of 2020. Approximately 66% of this deferred rent is due to be paid to NNN by June 30, 2021 and 89% is due by December 31, 2021. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. Rental revenues received as of October 28, 2020 as a percentage of annualized base rent for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 : % of Total Annual Base Rent (1) % of Rent Collected 1. Convenience stores 18.2 % 99.9 % 2. Restaurants – full service 10.5 % 76.2 % 3. Automotive service 10.2 % 100.0 % 4. Restaurants – limited service 8.8 % 73.6 % 5. Family entertainment centers 6.7 % 85.2 % 6. Health and fitness 5.3 % 84.9 % 7. Theaters 4.5 % 32.9 % 8. Recreational vehicle dealers, parts and accessories 3.5 % 99.7 % 9.

Bank 1.3 % 100.0 % Other 8.4 % 98.5 % Total 100.0 % 90.1 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of September 30, 2020. 20 Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. Rent collections for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, may not be indicative of rent collections in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN’s real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. NNN has materially curtailed new property investments in 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. As of September 30, 2020, NNN had $294,860,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility. While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. Business Continuity The full extent of the effects of the economic downturn on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its employees to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor did this transition have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. The rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN, but presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business, financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. 21 Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Acquisitions: Number of Properties — 27 21 131 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 15,000 533,000 299,000 2,645,000 Initial cash yield — 6.8 % 6.8 % 6.9 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 3,880 $ 116,801 $ 77,971 $ 509,598 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (See ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Number of properties 3 13 25 43 Gross leasable area (square feet) 26,000 360,000 315,000 853,000 Net sales proceeds $ 2,414 $ 33,469 $ 42,498 $ 94,828 Net gain $ 148 $ 2,061 $ 13,637 $ 25,508 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, total revenues decreased as compared to the same period in 2019, but remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the impact of recording revenue on a cash basis from certain tenants. The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Rental Revenues (1) $ 154,146 $ 164,207 (6.1%) $ 483,073 $ 483,981 (0.2%) Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,719 4,017 (7.4)% 12,818 11,865 8.0% Rental income 157,865 168,224 (6.2%) 495,891 495,846 — Interest and other income from real estate transactions 768 383 100.5% 1,506 1,265 19.1% Total revenues $ 158,633 $ 168,607 (5.9%) $ 497,397 $ 497,111 0.1% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 Rental Income. Rental income decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, but remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, is primarily due to the write-off of $14,758,000 of receivables due to reclassifying certain tenants as cash basis for accounting purposes during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020. 23 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the decrease in impairment losses recognized on real estate. Operating expenses increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 2020 2019 General and administrative $ 9,419 $ 8,726 7.9% $ 28,914 $ 27,524 5.1% Real estate 6,345 6,706 (5.4)% 20,304 20,398 (0.5)% Depreciation and amortization 49,404 48,348 2.2% 147,528 140,769 4.8% Leasing transaction costs — 51 (100.0)% 36 178 (79.8)% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 5,695 10,692 (46.7)% 33,062 21,124 56.5% Total operating expenses $ 70,863 $ 74,523 (4.9)% $ 229,844 $ 209,993 9.5% Interest and other income $ (74) $ (501) (85.2)% $ (345) $ (2,912) (88.2)% Interest expense 31,924 29,948 6.6% 97,347 89,716 8.5% Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — — 16,679 — N/C (1) Total other expenses $ 31,850 $ 29,447 8.2% $ 113,681 $ 86,804 31.0% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.9 % 5.2 % 5.8% 5.5 % Real estate 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.1% 4.1 % (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses decreased in amount for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, but remained flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. Real estate expenses remained unchanged as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease is primarily attributable to the disposition of vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in real estate expenses was partially offset by an increase in reimbursable expenses during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of 21 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 299,000 square feet in 2020 and 210 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet during 2019. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the 24 long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $33,062,000 and $21,124,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively of which $5,695,000 and $10,692,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased in amount for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale of equity investments and $1,471,000 in interest income on cash balances recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000) 3.800 % October 2022 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was also impacted by the increase of $16,796,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $25,239,000 and $8,443,000 at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. As of September 30, 2020, NNN has $294,860,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. While the total impacts of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. NNN has materially curtailed new property investments in 2020 in order to better gauge the impact of the economic downturn on retailers, retail real estate, capital markets and investment returns. (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 348,824 $ 399,032 Used in investing activities (48,569) (409,022) Provided by (used in) financing activities (6,507) 249,411 Increase 293,748 239,421 Net cash at beginning of period 1,112 114,267 Net cash at end of period $ 294,860 $ 353,688 25 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2020. The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2020.

(2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on seven Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 47,424 Less amount funded 36,471 Remaining commitment $ 10,953 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of September 30, 2020, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” 26 Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of September 30, 2020, NNN owned 51 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately two percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of October 28, 2020, approximately three percent of total Properties, and approximately three percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to five tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. 27 The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,097 — 12,291 Per depositary share — 0.356250 — 1.068750 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 13,455 13,455 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.975000 0.975000 Common stock: Dividends 89,947 83,935 266,365 245,574 Per share 0.520 0.515 1.550 1.515 (1) The 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In October 2020, NNN declared a dividend of $0.52 per share which is payable in November 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of October 30, 2020. Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2020 Percentage of Total December 31, 2019 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ — — $ 133,600 4.5 % Mortgages payable 11,565 0.4 % 12,059 0.4 % Notes payable 3,208,533 99.6 % 2,842,698 95.1 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,220,098 100.0 % $ 2,988,357 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by the 2020 Amendment (as defined below), the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $25,239,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% during the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations (the ""2020 Amendment""). As of September 30, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 28 Notes Payable. In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500% notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100% notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536%. NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $200,000,000. Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $13,141,000, which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The loss is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205%. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $395,062,000 and $290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $3,650,000 and $3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility, redeem all of its 3.800% notes payable that were due 2022, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In August 2020, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 121,988 309,127 Net proceeds $ 4,458 $ 16,481 29 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM programs: 2020 ATM 2018 ATM Established date August 2020 February 2018 Termination date August 2023 August 2020 Total allowable shares 17,500,000 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2020 84,501 11,272,034 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 1,634,350 2,344,022 Average price per share (net) $ 36.56 $ 53.73 Net proceeds $ 59,752 $ 125,946 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,151 $ 1,390 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the September 30, 2020, condensed consolidated financial statements. 30 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of September 30, 2020, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2020. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of September 30, 2020 and $133,600,000, as of December 31, 2019 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and 2.8%, respectively. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2020, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2024. 31 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2020, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Not applicable. Item 1A. Risk Factors. NNN is supplementing the risk factors set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report"") with the additional risk factor set forth below. This supplemental risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the 2019 Annual Report. The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, (“COVID-19”), or the future outbreak or pandemic of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Since that time, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants have announced mandated or temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. Experts predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will trigger a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession. COVID-19 (or a future pandemic) could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results from operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities due to, among other factors: • A complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, NNN’s Property Portfolio as a result of government or tenant action; • The declines in or instability of the economy or financial markets may result in a recession or negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, which could adversely affect retailers and consumers; • The reduction of economic activity may severely impact NNN’s tenants' business operations, financial condition, liquidity and access to capital resources and may cause one or more of NNN’s tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to NNN in full, or at all, to default on their lease, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; • Inability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect NNN’s access to capital necessary to fund business operations, pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, reduce NNN’s ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders and increase NNN’s future interest expense; • A general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions would adversely affect NNN’s ability to successfully execute investment strategies or expand the Property Portfolio; • A significant reduction in NNN’s cash flows could impact NNN’s ability to continue paying cash dividends to NNN common and preferred stockholders at expected levels or at all; • The financial impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect NNN’s future compliance with financial and other covenants of NNN’s credit facility and other debt instruments, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the payment of such indebtedness; and • The potential negative impact on the health of NNN’s associates or Board of Directors, particularly if a significant number are impacted, or the impact of government actions or restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, restricting access to NNN's headquarters located in Orlando, Florida, could result in a deterioration in NNN’s ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts NNN’s operations and those of NNN’s tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the tenant’s bankruptcy, which would diminish NNN’s ability to receive rental revenue it is owed under their leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. While NNN's leases generally do not allow tenants to withhold rent if the tenants are not 33 operating on its properties, some tenants may pay rent under protest or not pay rent at all and may assert legal or equitable claims in the courts that such tenants are not obligated to pay rent while closed or while operating at reduced capacity, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While NNN believes such claims would be without merit it has no assurances on how courts would rule on such claims, if any. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . June 30, 2020 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,117 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,454,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.9 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020. See ""Footnote 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2019 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. COVID-19 Pandemic – On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. Although various states have recently begun lifting certain restrictions, the initial actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the business closures or other social-distancing practices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain tenants have requested adjustments to their lease terms, primarily consisting of short-term rent deferrals of 30 to 90 days. NNN is negotiating terms with these tenants that would require the deferred rental revenues to be paid at a later time in the lease term, typically over 3 to 18 months with payment beginning in fourth quarter 2020. Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. Rent collections and rent relief requests for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. 11 A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on the economy, retailing and NNN. Nevertheless, the economic downturn presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover from the economic downturn. Business Continuity The full extent of the effects of the economic downturn on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See Item ""1A. Risk Factors."" As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its associates to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor did this transition have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 886,000 and $ 471,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $ 420,000 and $ 345,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in 12 that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – NNN reviews the collectability of its accounts receivable, including accrued rental income, related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probable collection. In addition, tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and considerations are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition bankruptcy claims. NNN includes allowance for doubtful accounts in rental income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), NNN recorded Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN has elected to make this policy election for COVID-19 lease concessions, including the rent deferral lease amendments effective during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 31,140,000 and $ 26,932,000 , as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 8,096,000 and $ 8,962,000 , respectively. Impairment – Real Estate – Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are currently vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – Effective January 1, 2020, NNN adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”). The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 326 requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The new guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. As of June 30, 2020, NNN had a mortgage receivable of $ 2,653,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 169,000 allowance for credit loss. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years. Adoption of ASC 326 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. 13 Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 46,265 $ 78,678 $ 111,443 $ 158,701 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends — ( 4,096 ) — ( 8,194 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 8,970 ) ( 8,970 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 41,780 70,097 102,473 141,537 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 176 ) ( 134 ) ( 336 ) ( 249 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 41,604 $ 69,963 $ 102,137 $ 141,288 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 172,301,757 162,697,005 172,064,786 162,243,958 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 342,079 ) ( 265,981 ) ( 326,816 ) ( 249,480 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 570,809 ) ( 537,582 ) ( 524,027 ) ( 492,923 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 171,388,869 161,893,442 171,213,943 161,501,555 Other dilutive securities 96,416 458,459 159,873 493,779 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 171,485,285 162,351,901 171,373,816 161,995,334 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 14 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the six months ended June 30, 2020, (dollars in thousands): Gain (Loss) on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2019 $ ( 11,128 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) ( 7,617 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 1,021 (2) Net other comprehensive income (loss) ( 6,596 ) Ending balance, June 30, 2020 $ ( 17,724 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (""ASU 2019-12""), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 will not have a significant impact on NNN's financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates – Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: June 30, 2020 Lease classification: Operating 3,128 Direct financing 6 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 10.9 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years. The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. During the second quarter, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants representing approximately 21 % of rent due for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. On average, 2.4 months of rent was deferred with approximately 86 % of 15 deferred rent originally due in the second quarter of 2020 and 14 % originally due in the third quarter of 2020. Approximately 66 % of this deferred rent is due to be paid to NNN by June 30, 2021 and 94 % is due by December 31, 2021. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,482,387 $ 2,492,305 Buildings and improvements 5,942,581 5,916,474 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,425,323 8,409,134 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,232,107 ) ( 1,147,524 ) 7,193,216 7,261,610 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 28,202 27,438 $ 7,221,418 $ 7,289,048 (1) Includes $ 10,315 and $ 16,930 in land for Properties under construction at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Rental income from operating leases $ 159,300 $ 160,234 $ 328,033 $ 318,632 Earned income from direct financing leases 162 208 326 420 Percentage rent 165 300 568 722 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,852 3,854 9,099 7,848 $ 163,479 $ 164,596 $ 338,026 $ 327,622 Some leases provide for a free rent period or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. As a result of the rent deferral lease amendments, NNN recorded $ 35,862,000 of accrued rental income during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, NNN recognized $ 30,717,000 and $ 925,000 , respectively, of such income, net of reserves, of which $ 30,894,000 and $ 296,000 of such income, net of reserves, was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the balance of accrued rental income was $ 59,459,000 and $ 28,897,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 7,481,000 and $ 1,842,000 , respectively. 16 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,845 $ 15,754 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,280 ) ( 9,897 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 5,565 $ 5,857 In-place leases $ 121,323 $ 119,846 Less: accumulated amortization ( 67,640 ) ( 64,918 ) In-place leases, net $ 53,683 $ 54,928 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 42,333 $ 41,767 Less: accumulated amortization ( 26,431 ) ( 26,135 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 15,902 $ 15,632 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, were $ 410,000 and $ 401,000 , respectively of which $ 190,000 and $ 173,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, were $ 4,337,000 and $ 4,042,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,942,000 and $ 1,798,000 was recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of June 30, 2020, NNN had four of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2019, included nine Properties, five of which were sold in 2020. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements $ 2,471 $ 5,676 Building and improvements 4,647 7,562 7,118 13,238 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 2,765 ) ( 4,144 ) Less impairment ( 738 ) ( 1,107 ) $ 3,615 $ 7,987 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 8 $ 719 13 $ 13,002 22 $ 13,489 30 $ 23,447 17 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on nine Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, as of June 30, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 52,488 Less amount funded 38,517 Remaining commitment $ 13,971 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 27,367,000 and $ 10,432,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $ 21,854,000 and $ 7,187,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by the 2020 Amendment (as defined below), the ""Credit Facility"") had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 37,998,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.5 % during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations (""2020 Amendment""). As of June 30, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $ 900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $ 400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500 % notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $ 300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100 % notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536 %. NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 200,000,000 . Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $ 13,141,000 , which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The loss is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. 18 The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205 %. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $ 395,062,000 and $ 290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 3,650,000 and $ 3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $ 325,000,000 3.800 % notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 16,679,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 33,246 137,316 Net proceeds $ 1,321 $ 7,166 At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2020 11,140,162 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 1,417,977 1,495,548 Average price per share (net) $ 36.68 $ 53.52 Net proceeds $ 52,018 $ 80,046 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 746 $ 766 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. 19 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Series E preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,096 $ — $ 8,194 Per depositary share — 0.356250 — 0.712500 Series F preferred stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 8,970 8,970 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.650000 0.650000 Common stock: Dividends 88,270 81,074 176,418 161,639 Per share 0.515 0.500 1.030 1.000 (1) The 5.700 % Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2020, NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.52 per share, which is payable in August 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. 20 The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2023 April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of June 30, 2020, $ 17,724,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 1,021,000 and $ 648,000 , respectively, of which $ 638,000 and $ 325,000 was reclassified during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,564,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at June 30, 2020. Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,331,910,000 and $ 3,074,538,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after June 30, 2020, the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the economic downturn which presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. As of July 30, 2020, NNN had collected approximately 69 % of rent due in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and 84 % of rent originally due in July 2020. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 21 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Also, when NNN uses any of the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” or similar expressions, NNN is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, NNN’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statement: • Changes in financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants, and commercial real estate in general; • An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the other risks, and may significantly disrupt NNN's tenants' ability to operate their businesses and/or pay rent to NNN or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period; • Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; • A significant portion of NNN's annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; • NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; • NNN may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy; • Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; • Competition from numerous other REITs, commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede NNN's ability to grow; • NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; • Uninsured losses may adversely affect NNN's operating results and asset values; • NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased properties may be limited; • Vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; • NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; • Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, employees, capital providers, and other third parties; • Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks; • NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default of or bankruptcy of a tenant or a borrower; • Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; • Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; • Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; • NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; • The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; • NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; • The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; • NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; • The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under NNN's variable rate debt; 22 • Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; • NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; • NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and hazardous materials on Properties owned by NNN; • The cost of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; • NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; • Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; • Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities; • Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; • The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; and • Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results. Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2019 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of June 30, 2020, NNN owned 3,117 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,454,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 10.9 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of June 30, 2020. NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 23 Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business Overview On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. Although various states have recently begun lifting certain restrictions, the initial actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. As a result, these economic hardships have had a negative effect on NNN's financial results, including increased accounts receivables and related allowances. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of July 30, 2020, NNN had collected approximately 69% of rent due in the quarter ended June 30, 2020 and 84% of rent originally due in July 2020. During the second quarter, NNN entered into rent deferral lease amendments with certain tenants representing approximately 21% of rent due for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. On average, 2.4 months of rent was deferred with approximately 86% of deferred rent originally due in the second quarter of 2020 and 14% originally due in the third quarter of 2020. Approximately 66% of this deferred rent is due to be paid to NNN by June 30, 2021 and 94% is due by December 31, 2021. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. 24 Rental revenues received as of July 30, 2020 as a percentage of annualized base rent for the quarter ended June 30, 2020 : % of Total Annual Base Rent (1) % of Rent Collected 1. Convenience stores 18.1 % 99.0 % 2. Restaurants – full service 10.6 % 40.5 % 3. Automotive service 10.2 % 53.8 % 4. Restaurants – limited service 8.8 % 80.0 % 5. Family entertainment centers 6.7 % 8.6 % 6. Health and fitness 5.2 % 58.4 % 7. Theaters 4.7 % 2.2 % 8. Recreational vehicle dealers, parts and accessories 3.5 % 100.0 % 9.

Bank 1.3 % 100.0 % Other 8.5 % 83.3 % Total 100.0 % 68.9 % (1) Based on annualized base rent for all leases in place as of June 30, 2020. Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. Rent collections for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, may not be indicative of rent collections in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN’s real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover from the economic downturn. As of June 30, 2020, NNN had $224,560,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility. While the impacts of COVID-19 are still unfolding, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. Business Continuity The full extent of the effects of the economic downturn on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" 25 As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN has transitioned a large portion of its employees to work remotely without any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor did this transition have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. The rapid development and fluidity of the economic downturn precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN, but presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. 26 Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Acquisitions: Number of Properties — 71 21 104 Gross leasable area (square feet) (1) 67,000 1,678,000 284,000 2,112,000 Initial cash yield — 6.9 % 6.9 % 6.9 % Total dollars invested (2) $ 6,894 $ 275,845 $ 74,091 $ 392,797 (1) Includes additional square footage from completed construction on existing Properties. (2) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (See ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Number of properties 8 13 22 30 Gross leasable area (square feet) 113,000 313,000 289,000 493,000 Net sales proceeds $ 3,818 $ 41,970 $ 40,084 $ 61,359 Net gain $ 719 $ 13,002 $ 13,489 $ 23,447 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, total revenues increased, as compared to the same periods in 2019, primarily due to the income generated from Properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2020 (See “Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions”). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Rental Revenues (1) $ 159,627 $ 160,742 (0.7%) $ 328,927 $ 319,774 2.9% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,852 3,854 (0.1)% 9,099 7,848 15.9% Rental income 163,479 164,596 (0.7%) 338,026 327,622 3.2% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 222 196 13.3% 738 882 (16.3%) Total revenues $ 163,701 $ 164,792 (0.7%) $ 338,764 $ 328,504 3.1% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, is primarily due to a partial year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 21 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 284,000 square feet during 2020 and a full year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 210 properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet in 2019. 28 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 2020 2019 General and administrative $ 9,395 $ 9,276 1.3% $ 19,495 $ 18,798 3.7% Real estate 6,323 6,600 (4.2)% 13,959 13,692 2.0% Depreciation and amortization 48,936 46,241 5.8% 98,124 92,421 6.2% Leasing transaction costs — 75 (100.0)% 36 127 (71.7)% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 21,854 7,187 204.1% 27,367 10,432 162.3% Total operating expenses $ 86,508 $ 69,379 24.7% $ 158,981 $ 135,470 17.4% Interest and other income $ (106) $ (487) (78.2)% $ (271) $ (2,411) (88.8)% Interest expense 31,753 29,811 6.5% 65,423 59,768 9.5% Loss on early extinguishment of debt — — — 16,679 — N/C (1) Total other expenses $ 31,647 $ 29,324 7.9% $ 81,831 $ 57,357 42.7% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.7 % 5.6 % 5.8% 5.7% Real estate 3.9 % 4.0 % 4.1% 4.2% (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount but remained relatively flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues but remained relatively flat for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The change in real estate expenses for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, is primarily attributable to the disposition of vacant properties during the year ended December 31, 2019 and the six months ended June 30, 2020. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the quarter and six months ended June 30,2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of 21 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 284,000 square feet in 2020 and 210 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet during 2019. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $27,367,000 and $10,432,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively of which $21,854,000 and $7,187,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 29 Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased in amount for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale of equity investments and $1,009,000 in interest income on cash balances recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2019. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020, as compared to the same periods in 2019. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000) 3.800 % October 2022 Interest expense for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020 was also impacted by the increase of $35,080,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Credit Facility had a weighted average outstanding balance of $37,998,000 and $2,918,000 at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. As of June 30, 2020, NNN has $224,560,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. While the total impacts of the economic downturn are unknown, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 187,717 $ 235,341 Used in investing activities (41,472) (317,836) Provided by (used in) financing activities 77,203 (29,563) Increase (decrease) 223,448 (112,058) Net cash at beginning of period 1,112 114,267 Net cash at end of period $ 224,560 $ 2,209 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. 30 Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses cash on hand or proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2020, included the following significant transactions: • $395,062,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 2.500% notes payable due in April 2030, • $290,459,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.100% notes payable due in April 2050, • $325,000,000 payment for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable in March, • $16,679,000 payment of the make-whole amount from the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable in March, • $1,321,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 33,246 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), • $52,018,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 1,417,977 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (""ATM"") equity program, • $8,970,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), and • $176,418,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of June 30, 2020.

(2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on nine Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at June 30, 2020, are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 52,488 Less amount funded 38,517 Remaining commitment $ 13,971 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of June 30, 2020, NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates 31 that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid all rent amounts due during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 (See ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of June 30, 2020, NNN owned 41 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, approximately two percent of total Properties, and approximately three percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to six tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged continuation of business closures or other social-distancing practices as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (See “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. 32 The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,096 — 8,194 Per depositary share — 0.356250 — 0.712500 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 8,970 8,970 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.650000 0.650000 Common stock: Dividends 88,270 81,074 176,418 161,639 Per share 0.515 0.500 1.030 1.000 (1) The 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2020, NNN declared a dividend of $0.52 per share which is payable in August 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2020 Percentage of Total December 31, 2019 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ — — $ 133,600 4.5 % Mortgages payable 11,731 0.4 % 12,059 0.4 % Notes payable 3,207,545 99.6 % 2,842,698 95.1 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,219,276 100.0 % $ 2,988,357 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by the 2020 Amendment (as defined below), the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $37,998,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during the six months ended June 30, 2020. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. In May 2020, NNN amended its Credit Facility to include the addition of new terms and definitions, and to restate certain other definitions under the former unsecured revolving credit agreement, some of which modified the financial covenant calculations (the ""2020 Amendment""). As of June 30, 2020, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility, and NNN was in compliance with each of the financial covenants. 33 Notes Payable. In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500% notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100% notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536%. NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $200,000,000. Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $13,141,000, which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The loss is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205%. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $395,062,000 and $290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $3,650,000 and $3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility, redeem all of its 3.800% notes payable that were due 2022, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. In March 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000, and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 33,246 137,316 Net proceeds $ 1,321 $ 7,166 34 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2020 11,140,162 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 1,417,977 1,495,548 Average price per share (net) $ 36.68 $ 53.52 Net proceeds $ 52,018 $ 80,046 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 746 $ 766 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the June 30, 2020, condensed consolidated financial statements. 35 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of June 30, 2020, NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2020. NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of June 30, 2020 and $133,600,000, as of December 31, 2019 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of June 30, 2020, and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the six months ended June 30, 2020.

NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2024. 36 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of June 30, 2020, of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 37 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Not applicable. Item 1A. Risk Factors. NNN is supplementing the risk factors set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report"") with the additional risk factor set forth below. This supplemental risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the 2019 Annual Report. The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, (“COVID-19”), or the future outbreak or pandemic of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities . On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Since that time, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants have announced mandated or temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. Experts predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will trigger a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession. COVID-19 (or a future pandemic) could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results from operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities due to, among other factors: • A complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, NNN’s Property Portfolio as a result of government or tenant action; • The declines in or instability of the economy or financial markets may result in a recession or negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, which could adversely affect retailers and consumers; • The reduction of economic activity may severely impact NNN’s tenants' business operations, financial condition, liquidity and access to capital resources and may cause one or more of NNN’s tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to NNN in full, or at all, to default on their lease, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; • Inability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect NNN’s access to capital necessary to fund business operations, pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, reduce NNN’s ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders and increase NNN’s future interest expense; • A general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions would adversely affect NNN’s ability to successfully execute investment strategies or expand the Property Portfolio; • A significant reduction in NNN’s cash flows could impact NNN’s ability to continue paying cash dividends to NNN common and preferred stockholders at expected levels or at all; • The financial impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect NNN’s future compliance with financial and other covenants of NNN’s credit facility and other debt instruments, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the payment of such indebtedness; and • The potential negative impact on the health of NNN’s associates or Board of Directors, particularly if a significant number are impacted, or the impact of government actions or restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, restricting access to NNN's headquarters located in Orlando, Florida, could result in a deterioration in NNN’s ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts NNN’s operations and those of NNN’s tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues to meet financial obligations, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the tenant’s bankruptcy, which would diminish NNN’s ability to receive rental revenue it is owed under their leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. While NNN's leases generally do not allow tenants to withhold rent if the tenants are not 38 operating on its properties, some tenants may pay rent under protest or not pay rent at all and may assert legal or equitable claims in the courts that such tenants are not obligated to pay rent while closed or while operating at reduced capacity, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While NNN believes such claims would be without merit it has no assurances on how courts would rule on such claims, if any. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . March 31, 2020 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,125 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,500,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.1 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2020 . See ""Footnote 8 – Subsequent Events."" Amounts as of December 31, 2019 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codifications (""ASC"") guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of Properties developed or funded by NNN includes direct and indirect costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 466,000 and $ 126,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, consideration for the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and, if applicable, to identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which 9 reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Lease Accounting – In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842"") NNN used the modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recognized at the date of initial application with a positive adjustment to NNN’s opening balance of accumulated deficit. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases upon adoption, which in comparative periods approximates the results of a full retrospective approach. NNN elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance (which included: (i) an entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) an entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (iii) an entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases), the land easement practical expedient to carry forward existing accounting treatment on existing land easements, and the lease and non-lease component combined practical expedient. NNN estimates the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probable collection. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. NNN recorded Right-Of-Use (""ROU"") assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019. In April 2020, the FASB issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of COVID-19. In this guidance, entities can elect not to apply lease modification accounting with respect to such lease concessions and instead, treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract. This guidance is only applicable to COVID-19 related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee. NNN is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance and whether NNN will make this policy election for lease concessions such as rent deferrals for the quarter ended June 30, 2020. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 31,140,000 and $ 26,932,000 , as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 7,492,000 and $ 8,962,000 , respectively. Impairment – Real Estate – Based upon certain events or changes in circumstances, management periodically assesses its Properties for possible impairment whenever the carrying value of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are currently vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Management evaluates whether an impairment in carrying value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying value of the individual asset. The future undiscounted cash flows are primarily driven by estimated future market rents. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years , which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. 10 Credit Losses on Financial Instruments – Effective January 1, 2020, NNN adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),” (“ASC 326”). The amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 326 requires entities to estimate an expected lifetime credit loss on financial assets ranging from short-term trade accounts receivable to long-term financings. The new guidance requires a lifetime credit loss expected at inception and requires pooling of assets, which share similar risk characteristics. NNN is required to evaluate current economic conditions, as well as, make future expectations of economic conditions. In addition, the measurement of the expected credit loss is over the asset’s contractual term. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, NNN recorded a mortgage receivable of $ 2,737,000 included in other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of $ 174,000 allowance for credit loss. NNN measures the allowance for credit loss based on the fair value of the collateral and the historical collectability trend analysis over 15 years . Adoption of ASC 326 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 65,178 $ 80,023 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends — ( 4,097 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 60,693 71,441 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 160 ) ( 116 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 60,533 $ 71,325 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 171,827,815 161,785,877 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 311,553 ) ( 232,795 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 477,245 ) ( 447,767 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 171,039,017 161,105,315 Other dilutive securities 192,811 508,759 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 171,231,828 161,614,074 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are 11 observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in thousands): Gain or Loss on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Beginning balance, December 31, 2019 $ ( 11,128 ) Other comprehensive income ( 7,617 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 383 (2) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 7,234 ) Ending balance, March 31, 2020 $ ( 18,362 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. New Accounting Pronouncements – In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (""ASU 2019-12""), effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. NNN is currently evaluating to determine the potential impact the adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have on NNN's financial position or results of operations. Use of Estimates – Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2020 presentation. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: March 31, 2020 Lease classification: Operating 3,141 Direct financing 6 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.1 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years . The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable 12 base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,489,398 $ 2,490,959 Buildings and improvements 5,943,971 5,913,799 Leasehold interests 355 355 8,433,724 8,405,113 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,187,925 ) ( 1,146,334 ) 7,245,799 7,258,779 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 39,437 27,438 $ 7,285,236 $ 7,286,217 (1) Includes $ 16,618 and $ 16,930 in land for Properties under construction at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Rental income from operating leases $ 168,733 $ 158,398 Earned income from direct financing leases 164 213 Percentage rent 403 422 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 5,247 3,993 $ 174,547 $ 163,026 Some leases provide for a free rent term or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , NNN recognized ($ 177,000 ) and $ 630,000 , respectively, of such income, net of reserves. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 28,592,000 and $ 28,897,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 1,842,000 . 13 Real Estate – Intangibles In accordance with purchase accounting for the acquisition of real estate subject to a lease, NNN has recorded intangible assets and lease liabilities that consisted of the following at (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,845 $ 15,754 Less: accumulated amortization ( 10,090 ) ( 9,897 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 5,755 $ 5,857 In-place leases $ 121,674 $ 119,846 Less: accumulated amortization ( 66,048 ) ( 64,918 ) In-place leases, net $ 55,626 $ 54,928 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 42,633 $ 41,767 Less: accumulated amortization ( 26,351 ) ( 26,135 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 16,282 $ 15,632 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , were $ 220,000 and $ 228,000 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , were $ 2,395,000 and $ 2,244,000 , respectively. Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of March 31, 2020 , NNN had six of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2019 , included 11 Properties, five of which were sold in 2020. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Land and improvements $ 3,817 $ 7,022 Building and improvements 7,972 10,888 11,789 17,910 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 3,953 ) ( 5,334 ) Less impairment ( 3,338 ) ( 1,758 ) $ 4,498 $ 10,818 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 # of Sold Properties Net Gain # of Sold Properties Net Gain Net gain on disposition of real estate 14 $ 12,770 17 $ 10,445 14 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 17 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months . These construction commitments, as of March 31, 2020 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 74,525 Less amount funded 56,055 Remaining commitment $ 18,470 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are currently vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years , which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 5,513,000 and $ 3,245,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 75,996,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.5 % during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 . The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of March 31, 2020 , there was no outstanding balance and $ 900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Note 4 – Notes Payable : In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $ 400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500 % notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $ 300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100 % notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536 % . NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $ 200,000,000 . Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $ 13,141,000 , which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The loss is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $ 293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $ 6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes 15 using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205 % . The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $ 395,062,000 and $ 290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $ 3,650,000 and $ 3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. On March 20, 2020, NNN redeemed the $ 325,000,000 3.800 % notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100 % of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $ 16,679,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 12,528 101,180 Net proceeds $ 696 $ 5,279 At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2020 9,722,185 There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 16 Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Series E preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,097 Per depositary share — 0.356250 Series F preferred stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 Common stock: Dividends 88,148 80,566 Per share 0.515 0.500 (1) The 5.700 % Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2020 , NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.515 per share, which is payable in May 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2020 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as an operating activity. 17 The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Notes Payable Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) 2023 April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 2024 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 2025 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 2026 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) 2027 September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 2028 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) 2030 March 2020 Three forward starting swaps 200,000 13,141 13,141 (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of March 31, 2020 , $ 18,362,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 384,000 and $ 323,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 2,555,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2020 . Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 , the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,277,730,000 and $ 3,074,538,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : Overview A novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. The actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. NNN expects these economic hardships to have a negative effect on its financial results, particularly beginning the quarter ending June 30, 2020. Generally, NNN leases do not allow tenants to withhold rent as a result of such closures or reduced operations by tenants. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of April 29, 2020, NNN has collected approximately 52 % of annualized base rent originally due in April 2020. As of April 29, 2020, certain tenants, representing approximately 37 % of annualized base rent, have requested adjustments to their lease terms, primarily consisting of short-term rent deferrals of 30 to 90 days . NNN is negotiating terms with these tenants that would require the deferred rental revenues to be paid at a later time in the lease term, typically over 3 to 18 months with payment beginning in fourth quarter 2020. Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. April rent collections and rent relief requests to- 18 date may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ revenues, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Business Continuity The extent of the effects of COVID-19 on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See Item ""1A. Risk Factors."" NNN was able to transition a large portion of its associates to work remotely and does not anticipate any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after March 31, 2020, the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 19 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report""). The terms “NNN” and the “Company” refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. Forward-Looking Statements The information herein contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Also, when NNN uses any of the words “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” or similar expressions, NNN is making forward-looking statements. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are based upon present expectations and reasonable assumptions, NNN’s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statement: • Changes in financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on NNN, its tenants, and commercial real estate in general; • Loss of rent from tenants would reduce NNN's cash flow; • A significant portion of NNN's annual base rent is concentrated in specific industry classifications, tenants and geographic locations; • NNN may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition or development strategies; • NNN may not be able to dispose of properties consistent with its operating strategy; • Certain provisions of NNN's leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable; • Competition from numerous other REITs, commercial developers, real estate limited partnerships and other investors may impede NNN's ability to grow; • NNN's loss of key management personnel could adversely affect performance and the value of its securities; • Uninsured losses may adversely affect NNN's operating results and asset values; • NNN's ability to fully control the management of its net-leased properties may be limited; • Vacant properties or bankrupt tenants could adversely affect NNN's business or financial condition; • NNN's failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and the market value of NNN's securities; • Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect NNN's business, disrupt operations and expose NNN to liabilities to tenants, employees, capital providers, and other third parties; • Future investment in international markets could subject NNN to additional risks. • NNN may suffer a loss in the event of a default of or bankruptcy of a tenant or a borrower; • Property ownership through joint ventures and partnerships could limit NNN's control of those investments; • Acts of violence, terrorist attacks or war may affect the markets in which NNN operates and NNN's results of operations; • Changes in accounting pronouncements could adversely impact NNN's or NNN's tenants' reported financial performance; • NNN may be unable to obtain debt or equity capital on favorable terms, if at all; • The amount of debt NNN has and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect NNN's business and financial condition; • NNN is obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in its debt instruments that could restrict its operating activities, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate the payment of such debt; • The market value of NNN's equity and debt securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility; • NNN's ability to pay dividends in the future is subject to many factors; • The phase-out of LIBOR could affect interest rates under NNN's variable rate debt; • Owning real estate and indirect interests in real estate carries inherent risks; • NNN's real estate investments are illiquid; • NNN may be subject to known or unknown environmental liabilities and hazardous materials on Properties owned by NNN; 20 • The cost of complying with changes in governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect NNN's results of operations; • NNN's failure to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes could result in significant tax liability; • Even if NNN remains qualified as a REIT, NNN faces other tax liabilities that reduce operating results and cash flow; • Adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes could reduce NNN's earnings and cash flow and the market value of NNN's securities; • Compliance with REIT requirements, including distribution requirements, may limit NNN's flexibility and may negatively affect NNN's operating decisions; • The share ownership restrictions of the Internal Revenue Code for REITs and the 9.8% share ownership limit in NNN's charter may inhibit market activity in NNN's shares of stock and restrict NNN's business combination opportunities; • Non-compliance with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 could have an adverse effect on NNN's business and operating results; and • An epidemic or pandemic (such as the outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19), and the measures that international, federal, state and local governments, agencies, law enforcement and/or health authorities implement to address it, may precipitate or materially exacerbate one or more of the above-mentioned risks, and may significantly disrupt or prevent NNN from operating its business in the ordinary course for an extended period. Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" of NNN's 2019 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of March 31, 2020 , NNN owned 3,125 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,500,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.1 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of March 31, 2020 . NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business Overview A novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a 21 pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. The actions taken by the government to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 by ordering closure of many businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home has resulted in the loss of revenue for many of NNN's tenants and challenged their ability to pay rent. NNN expects these economic hardships to have a negative effect on its financial results particularly beginning the quarter ending June 30, 2020. Generally, NNN leases do not allow tenants to withhold rent as a result of such closings or reduced operations by tenants. NNN is actively working with its tenants that have been impacted by the mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic to understand the implications that the COVID-19 has had on the tenants’ operations. As of April 29, 2020, NNN has collected approximately 52% of annualized base rent originally due in April 2020. As of April 29, 2020, certain tenants, representing approximately 37% of annualized base rent, have requested adjustments to their lease terms, primarily consisting of short-term rent deferrals of 30 to 90 days. NNN is negotiating terms with these tenants that would require the deferred rental revenues to be paid at a later time in the lease term, typically over 3 to 18 months beginning in fourth quarter 2020. Rent collections may continue below amounts required under the leases until economic activity materially improves. April rent collections and rent relief requests to-date may not be indicative of rent collections and requests in the future. Depending upon the duration of impact on tenants and the overall economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, NNN may find deferred rents difficult to collect. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. Additionally, an increase in the number of vacant properties would increase NNN’s real estate expenses, including expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and repairs, utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2020, NNN has $217,383,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility. While the impacts of COVID-19 are unknown, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. Business Continuity The extent of the effects of COVID-19 on NNN's business, results of operations, cash flows, and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors."" NNN was able to transition a large portion of its employees to work remotely and does not anticipate any adverse impact on its ability to continue to operate its business nor have any material adverse impact on NNN's financial reporting systems, internal controls over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN. Nevertheless, COVID-19 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. 22 Results of Operations Property Analysis General. The following table summarizes the Property Portfolio: March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 March 31, 2019 Properties Owned: Number 3,125 3,118 2,984 Total gross leasable area (square feet) 32,500,000 32,460,000 30,698,000 Properties: Leased and unimproved land 3,088 3,086 2,931 Percent of Properties – leased and unimproved land 99 % 99 % 98 % Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.1 11.2 11.4 Total gross leasable area (square feet) – leased 31,910,000 31,818,000 29,618,000 The following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio based on the top 10 lines of trade: % of Annual Base Rent (1) Lines of Trade March 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 March 31, 2019 1.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 21 33 Gross leasable area (square feet) 217,000 434,000 Initial cash yield 6.9 % 7.0 % Total dollars invested (1) $ 67,197 $ 116,952 (1) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (see ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 23 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Number of properties 14 17 Gross leasable area (square feet) 176,000 180,000 Net sales proceeds $ 36,266 $ 19,389 Net gain $ 12,770 $ 10,445 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , total revenues increased, as compared to the same period in 2019 , primarily due to the income generated from Properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019 and quarter ended March 31, 2020 (See “Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions”). The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 Rental Revenues (1) $ 169,300 $ 159,033 6.5% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 5,247 3,993 31.4% Rental income 174,547 163,026 7.1% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 516 686 (24.8%) Total revenues $ 175,063 $ 163,712 6.9% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, is primarily due to a partial year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 21 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 217,000 square feet during 2020 and a full year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 210 properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet in 2019. 24 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2020 2019 General and administrative $ 10,100 $ 9,521 6.1% Real estate 7,635 7,093 7.6% Depreciation and amortization 49,188 46,180 6.5% Leasing transaction costs 36 52 (30.8)% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 5,513 3,245 69.9% Total operating expenses $ 72,472 $ 66,091 9.7% Interest and other income $ (164 ) $ (1,924 ) (91.5)% Interest expense 33,670 29,957 12.4% Loss on early extinguishment of debt 16,679 — N/C Total other expenses $ 50,185 $ 28,033 79.0% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.8 % 5.8 % Real estate 4.4 % 4.3 % (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount but remained flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses for quarter ended March 31, 2020, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in reimbursable expenses and partially offset by the decrease in expenses from certain properties that became vacant during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, and during the year ended December 31, 2019. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of 21 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 217,000 square feet in 2020 and 210 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 3,164,000 square feet during 2019. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN's Properties are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment. Generally, NNN’s Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years, which provide for cash flows over this term. NNN intends to hold these assets for the long-term, therefore, a temporary change in cash flows due to COVID-19 alone would not be an indicator of impairment. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $5,513,000 and $3,245,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 25 Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income decreased in amount for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , as compared to the same period in 2019 . The decrease is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale of equity investments during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense (dollars in thousands): Transaction Effective Date Principal Stated Interest Rate Original Maturity Issuance 2030 Notes March 2020 $ 400,000 2.500 % April 2030 Issuance 2050 Notes March 2020 300,000 3.100 % April 2050 Redemption 2022 Notes March 2020 (325,000 ) 3.800 % October 2022 Interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, was also impacted by the increase of $75,996,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance at March 31, 2019. In addition, interest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, includes $2,291,000 in connection with the early redemption of the 2022 Notes. Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On March 20, 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. As of March 31, 2020, NNN has $217,383,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $900,000,000 available for borrowings under its Credit Facility. While the impacts of COVID-19 are unknown, NNN currently expects these combined resources, in addition to the cash provided by NNN's operations to be sufficient to meet NNN's demand for funds. NNN is currently deferring material new property investments until there is more visibility on how and when the economy and capital markets might begin to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic (see ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. NNN did not have restricted cash or cash held in escrow as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 128,084 $ 143,376 Used in investing activities (30,654 ) (93,030 ) Provided by (used in) financing activities 118,841 (84,092 ) Increase (decrease) 216,271 (33,746 ) Net cash at beginning of period 1,112 114,267 Net cash at end of period $ 217,383 $ 80,521 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. 26 NNN’s financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 , included the following significant transactions: • $395,062,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 2.500% notes payable due in April 2030, • $290,459,000 in net proceeds from the issuance in March of the 3.100% notes payable due in April 2050, • $325,000,000 payment for the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable in March, • $16,679,000 payment of the make-whole amount from the early redemption of the 3.800% notes payable in March, • $696,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 12,528 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), • $4,485,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), and • $88,148,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2020 . The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2020 . Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 3,261,690 $ 449 $ 630 $ 664 $ 359,947 $ 350,000 $ 2,550,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,312,292 89,484 119,281 119,247 110,820 99,756 773,704 Headquarters office lease 4,043 583 788 804 821 837 210 Ground leases 8,305 423 573 582 582 601 5,544 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,586,330 $ 90,939 $ 121,272 $ 121,297 $ 472,170 $ 451,194 $ 3,329,458 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 17 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at March 31, 2020 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 74,525 Less amount funded 56,055 Remaining commitment $ 18,470 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of March 31, 2020 , NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 . In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term triple net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. 27 The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. NNN currently expects a short-term decrease in cash from operations as its tenants are impacted by the pandemic and, while contractually obligated, some have not paid rent during April 2020 (see ""Impact of COVID-19 on NNN's Business""). As of March 31, 2020 , NNN owned 37 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of April 29, 2020, approximately one percent of total Properties, and approximately one percent of aggregate gross leasable area held in the Property Portfolio, was leased to four tenants that are currently in bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, these tenants have the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines as a result of COVID-19 may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants, which would diminish the rental revenue NNN receives under its leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN (see “Impact of COVID-19 on NNN’s Business”). Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ — $ 4,097 Per depositary share — 0.356250 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 Common stock: Dividends 88,148 80,566 Per share 0.515 0.500 (1) The 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") was redeemed in October 2019. The dividends paid in 2019 include accumulated and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2020 , NNN declared a dividend of $0.515 per share which is payable in May 2020 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2020 . 28 Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2020 Percentage of Total December 31, 2019 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ — — $ 133,600 4.5 % Mortgages payable 11,895 0.4 % 12,059 0.4 % Notes payable 3,206,563 99.6 % 2,842,698 95.1 % Total outstanding debt $ 3,218,458 100.0 % $ 2,988,357 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $75,996,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 . The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of March 31, 2020 , there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Notes Payable. In February 2020, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and, subsequently, in March 2020, issued $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.500% notes due April 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) and $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 3.100% notes due April 2050 (the ""2050 Notes"" and, together with the 2030 Notes, the ""Notes""). The 2030 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $398,712,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $1,288,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2030 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 2.536% . NNN previously entered into three forward starting swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $200,000,000 . Upon issuance of the 2030 Notes, NNN terminated the forward starting swaps resulting in a loss of $13,141,000 , which was deferred in other comprehensive income. The gain is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 2030 Notes using the effective interest method. The 2050 Notes were sold at a discount with an aggregate purchase price of $293,934,000 with interest payable semi-annually commencing on October 15, 2020. The discount of $6,066,000 is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the notes using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate for the 2050 Notes after accounting for the note discount is 3.205% . The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of NNN and are subordinated to all secured indebtedness and to the indebtedness and other liabilities of NNN's subsidiaries. Additionally, the Notes are each redeemable at NNN's option, in whole or part anytime, for an amount equal to (i) the sum of the outstanding principal balance of the notes being redeemed plus accrued interest thereon to the redemption date, and (ii) the make-whole amount, if any, as defined in the supplemental indenture dated February 18, 2020, relating to the Notes. NNN received approximately $395,062,000 and $290,459,000 of net proceeds in connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively, after incurring debt issuance costs consisting primarily of underwriting discounts and commissions, legal and accounting fees, rating agency fees and printing expenses, totaling $3,650,000 and $3,475,000 for the 2030 Notes and the 2050 Notes, respectively. NNN used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay all of the 29 outstanding indebtedness under its credit facility, redeem all of its 3.800% notes payable that were due 2022, fund future property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. On March 20, 2020, NNN redeemed the $325,000,000 3.800% notes payable due October 2022. The notes were redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus (i) a make-whole amount of $16,679,000 , and (ii) accrued and unpaid interest. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 2019 Shares of common stock 12,528 101,180 Net proceeds $ 696 $ 5,279 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2020 9,722,185 There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the March 31, 2020 , condensed consolidated financial statements. 30 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of March 31, 2020 , NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 . The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2020 . NNN has a variable interest rate risk on its Credit Facility which had no outstanding balance as of March 31, 2020 and $133,600,000, as of December 31, 2019 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of March 31, 2020 , and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2020.

(2) Includes NNN’s notes payable, each exclude debt costs and are net of unamortized discounts. NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2024. 31 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of March 31, 2020 , of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There has been no change in NNN's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 32 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings. Not applicable. Item 1A. Risk Factors. NNN is supplementing the risk factors set forth under Item 1A. Risk Factors in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (""2019 Annual Report"") with the additional risk factor set forth below. This supplemental risk factor should be read in conjunction with the risk factors set forth in the 2019 Annual Report. The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus, (“COVID-19”), or the future outbreak or pandemic of any other highly infectious or contagious diseases, could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities . A novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and has since spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency. Since that time, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. Several countries, including the United States, have taken steps to restrict travel, temporarily close businesses and issue quarantine orders, and it remains unclear how long such measures will remain in place. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting almost every industry directly or indirectly. A number of NNN’s tenants have announced mandated or temporary closures of their operations and/or have requested adjustments to their lease terms during this pandemic. Experts predict that the COVID-19 pandemic will trigger a period of global economic slowdown or a global recession. COVID-19 (or a future pandemic) could have a material and adverse effect on or cause disruption to NNN’s business or financial condition, results from operations, cash flows and the market value and trading price of NNN's securities due to, among other factors: • A complete or partial closure of, or other operational issues at, NNN’s Property Portfolio as a result of government or tenant action; • The declines in or instability of the economy or financial markets may result in a recession or negatively impact consumer discretionary spending, which could adversely affect retailers and consumers; • The reduction of economic activity may severely impact NNN’s tenants' business operations, financial condition, liquidity and access to capital resources and may cause one or more of NNN’s tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to NNN in full, or at all, to default on their lease, or to otherwise seek modifications of such obligations; • Inability to access debt and equity capital on favorable terms, if at all, or a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect NNN’s access to capital necessary to fund business operations, pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, reduce NNN’s ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders and increase NNN’s future interest expense; • A general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions would adversely affect NNN’s ability to successfully execute investment strategies or expand the Property Portfolio; • A significant reduction in NNN’s cash flows could impact NNN’s ability to continue paying cash dividends to NNN common and preferred stockholders at expected levels or at all; • The financial impact of COVID-19 could negatively affect NNN’s future compliance with financial and other covenants of NNN’s credit facility and other debt instruments, and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default that accelerates the payment of such indebtedness; and • The potential negative impact on the health of NNN’s associates or Board of Directors, particularly if a significant number are impacted, or the impact of government actions or restrictions, including stay-at-home orders, restricting access to NNN's headquarters located in Orlando, Florida, could result in a deterioration in NNN’s ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts NNN’s operations and those of NNN’s tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the outbreak, the actions taken to contain the outbreak or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the outbreak and containment measures, among others. A prolonged imposition of mandated closures or other social-distancing guidelines may adversely impact NNN's tenants’ ability to generate sufficient revenues, and could force tenants to default on their leases, or result in the tenant’s bankruptcy or insolvency, which would diminish NNN’s ability to receive rental revenue it is owed under their leases. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact on NNN. Nevertheless, COVID-19 33 presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to NNN’s performance, business or financial condition, results from operations and cash flows. Item 2.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . September 30, 2019 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,057 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,209,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.2 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 . Amounts as of December 31, 2018 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of properties developed by NNN includes costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 797,000 and $ 2,500,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $ 327,000 and $ 596,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired leased property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. 11 In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Intangible assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,786 $ 15,175 Less: accumulated amortization ( 9,801 ) ( 9,239 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 5,985 $ 5,936 In-place leases $ 119,713 $ 104,871 Less: accumulated amortization ( 63,916 ) ( 60,797 ) In-place leases, net $ 55,797 $ 44,074 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 42,099 $ 41,554 Less: accumulated amortization ( 25,922 ) ( 25,258 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 16,177 $ 16,296 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 579,000 and $ 2,334,000 , respectively, of which $ 178,000 and $ 219,000 were recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 5,946,000 and $ 7,305,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,904,000 and $ 1,789,000 were recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Lease Accounting – Effective January 1, 2019, NNN adopted ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842"") using the modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recognized at the date of initial application with a positive adjustment to NNN’s opening balance of accumulated deficit. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases upon adoption which in comparative periods approximates the results of a full retrospective approach. NNN elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance (which included: (i) an entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) an entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (iii) an entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases), the land easement practical expedient to carry forward existing accounting treatment on existing land easements, and the lease and non-lease component combined practical expedient. NNN estimates the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probable collection. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. 12 Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019. Additional disclosures are included in Note 3 – Right-Of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 are presented under the new standard, while comparative periods presented are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with NNN's historical accounting policy. ASC 842 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s $ 900,000,000 line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the line of credit as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Mortgages Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s mortgages payable have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. These costs of $ 147,000 as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , are included in mortgages payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 86,000 and $ 73,000 , respectively. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 26,932,000 , as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 8,387,000 and $ 6,705,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09, is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 13 The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 66,693 $ 82,032 $ 225,394 $ 255,886 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends ( 4,097 ) ( 4,097 ) ( 12,291 ) ( 12,291 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 13,455 ) ( 13,455 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 58,111 73,450 199,648 230,140 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 163 ) ( 147 ) ( 412 ) ( 412 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 57,948 $ 73,303 $ 199,236 $ 229,728 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 165,737,947 157,634,757 163,421,419 155,316,866 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 316,856 ) ( 294,453 ) ( 272,185 ) ( 276,046 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 537,582 ) ( 487,320 ) ( 507,973 ) ( 458,371 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 164,883,509 156,852,984 162,641,261 154,582,449 Other dilutive securities 478,222 433,181 484,802 425,408 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 165,361,731 157,286,165 163,126,063 155,007,857 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 14 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in thousands): Gain or Loss on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities Total Beginning balance, December 31, 2018 $ ( 6,911 ) $ 1,215 $ ( 5,696 ) Other comprehensive income ( 11,738 ) 116 ( 11,622 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 975 (2) ( 1,331 ) (3) ( 356 ) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 10,763 ) ( 1,215 ) ( 11,978 ) Ending balance, September 30, 2019 $ ( 17,674 ) $ — $ ( 17,674 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. (3) Recorded in interest and other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Management has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. NNN adopted certain practical expedients in ASC 842 which allows the presentation of all income earned pursuant to tenant leases to be included in rental income reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Note 2 – Real Estate : Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: September 30, 2019 Lease classification: Operating 3,084 Direct financing 7 Building portion – direct financing/land portion – operating 1 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.2 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years . The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. 15 Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,463,934 $ 2,368,891 Buildings and improvements 5,752,916 5,461,888 Leasehold interests 355 3,630 8,217,205 7,834,409 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,109,285 ) ( 1,003,519 ) 7,107,920 6,830,890 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 13,236 8,017 $ 7,121,156 $ 6,838,907 (1) Includes $ 11,707 and $ 5,571 in land for Properties under construction at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Rental income from operating leases $ 163,674 $ 150,418 $ 482,306 $ 449,216 Earned income from direct financing leases 204 242 624 696 Percentage rent 329 284 1,051 1,018 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,017 3,712 11,865 11,640 $ 168,224 $ 154,656 $ 495,846 $ 462,570 Some leases provide for a free rent term or scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , NNN recognized $ 1,354,000 and $ 547,000 , respectively, of such income, net of reserves, of which $ 429,000 and ($ 163,000 ) of such income, net of reserves, was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 28,570,000 and $ 25,387,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 1,842,000 . The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on noncancellable operating leases as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 163,060 2020 648,578 2021 630,739 2022 600,904 2023 572,995 Thereafter 4,757,532 $ 7,373,808 Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the tenant, the above table only presents undiscounted cash flows due during the current lease terms. In addition, this table does not include amounts for potential variable rent increases that are based on the CPI or future contingent rents which may be received on the leases based on a percentage of the tenant’s sales volume. 16 Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Direct Financing Method – The following lists the components of net investment in direct financing leases as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Minimum lease payments to be received $ 9,860 $ 10,899 Estimated unguaranteed residual values 3,632 4,395 Less unearned income ( 6,610 ) ( 7,225 ) Net investment in direct financing leases $ 6,882 $ 8,069 The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on direct financing leases held for investment as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 360 2020 1,045 2021 920 2022 897 2023 895 Thereafter 5,743 $ 9,860 The table above does not include future minimum lease payments for renewal periods, potential variable CPI rent increases or contingent rental payments that may become due in future periods (see Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method). Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of September 30, 2019 , NNN had five of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2018 , included eight Properties, three of which were sold in 2019. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements $ 5,120 $ 13,720 Building and improvements 15,591 41,738 20,711 55,458 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 6,172 ) ( 12,752 ) Less impairment ( 578 ) ( 14,250 ) $ 13,961 $ 28,456 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 13 $ 2,061 18 $ 14,348 43 $ 25,508 46 $ 57,050 17 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 12 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months . These construction commitments, as of September 30, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 53,724 Less amount funded 24,943 Remaining commitment $ 28,781 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 21,124,000 and $ 9,718,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $ 10,692,000 and $ 3,635,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Right-Of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities : NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognized an ROU asset (recorded in o ther assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in o ther liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. ROU assets represent NNN’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent NNN’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. NNN estimates an incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019 (the date of adoption of ASC 842) would not have a material impact on NNN’s financial position. NNN will reevaluate its incremental borrowing rate on an annual basis. NNN's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. 18 As of September 30, 2019 , NNN has recorded the following (dollars in thousands): Ground Leases Headquarters Office Lease Operating lease – ROU assets (1) $ 4,548 $ 3,117 Operating lease – lease liabilities ( 6,247 ) ( 3,775 ) Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 14.5 5.5 Weighted average discount rate 4.1 % 3.5 % (1) ROU assets are shown net of accrued lease payments of $ 1,699 and $ 658 , respectively. The following is a schedule of the undiscounted cash flows to be paid as of September 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Ground Leases Headquarters Office Lease 2019 $ 136 $ 191 2020 564 773 2021 573 788 2022 582 804 2023 582 821 Thereafter 6,145 1,047 $ 8,582 $ 4,424 Note 4 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 8,443,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2 % during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of September 30, 2019 , there was no outstanding balance and $ 900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. In September 2019, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $ 56.50 per share and received net proceeds of $ 379,410,000 . In connection with this offering, NNN incurred stock issuance costs totaling approximately $ 16,090,000 , consisting primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, legal and accounting fees and printing expenses. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 309,127 225,481 Net proceeds $ 16,481 $ 9,115 19 At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2019 9,722,185 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 2,344,022 4,896,563 Average price per share (net) $ 53.73 $ 42.60 Net proceeds $ 125,946 $ 208,579 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,390 $ 2,792 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Series E preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,097 $ 4,097 $ 12,291 $ 12,291 Per depositary share 0.356250 0.356250 1.068750 1.068750 Series F preferred stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 13,455 13,455 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.975000 0.975000 Common stock: Dividends 83,935 78,253 245,574 223,836 Per share 0.515 0.500 1.515 1.450 (1) In September 2019, NNN called for redemption of all outstanding shares of its 5.700 % Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock""), including all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, on October 5, 2019. (2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In October 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.515 per share, which is payable in November 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2019 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps 20 and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the statement of cash flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of September 30, 2019 , $ 5,936,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 975,000 and $ 1,581,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 1,349,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, NNN entered into three forward starting swaps with a total notional amount of $ 200,000,000 to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential issuance of long-term debt. The outstanding forward swaps were designated as cash flow hedges, and as of September 30, 2019 , had a fair value of $ 11,738,000 included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the forward starting swaps were based on Level 2 valuation. These derivative financial instruments were still outstanding as of September 30, 2019 . NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. 21 Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,074,246,000 and $ 2,813,583,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after September 30, 2019 , the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In September 2019, NNN announced the redemption of all outstanding depositary shares representing interests in its 5.700 % Series E Preferred Stock. The depositary shares were redeemed on October 5, 2019 at $ 25.00 per depositary share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $ 25.079167 per depositary share. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, NNN will record a preferred stock redemption charge of $ 9,856,000 , which is the excess carrying amount of the preferred stock redeemed over the cash paid to redeem the Series E Preferred Stock. After the redemption date, dividends on the depositary shares representing interests in the Series E Preferred Stock ceased to accrue. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 22 Item 2.

Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of September 30, 2019 , NNN owned 3,057 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,209,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.2 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of September 30, 2019 . NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 24 Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the Property acquisitions (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Acquisitions: Number of Properties 27 18 131 129 Gross leasable area (square feet) 533,000 529,000 2,645,000 1,265,000 Initial cash yield 6.8 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 6.9 % Total dollars invested (1) $ 116,801 $ 78,620 $ 509,598 $ 396,091 (1) Includes dollars invested in projects under construction or tenant improvements for each respective year. NNN typically funds Property acquisitions either through borrowings under NNN's unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility"") (see ""Debt – Line of Credit Payable"") or by issuing its debt or equity securities in the capital markets. 25 Property Dispositions. The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Number of properties 13 18 43 46 Gross leasable area (square feet) 360,000 179,000 853,000 531,000 Net sales proceeds $ 33,469 $ 37,586 $ 94,828 $ 121,106 Gain $ 2,061 $ 14,348 $ 25,508 $ 57,050 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , total revenues increased, as compared to the same periods in 2018 , primarily due to the increase in income from Property acquisitions (See “Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions”). NNN anticipates increases in revenues will continue to come from additional Property acquisitions and increases in rents pursuant to existing lease terms. The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Rental Revenues (1) $ 164,207 $ 150,944 8.8% $ 483,981 $ 450,930 7.3% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 4,017 3,712 8.2% 11,865 11,640 1.9% Rental income 168,224 154,656 8.8% 495,846 462,570 7.2% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 383 675 (43.3%) 1,265 1,113 13.7% Total revenues $ 168,607 $ 155,331 8.5% $ 497,111 $ 463,683 7.2% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, is primarily due to a partial year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 131 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,645,000 during 2019 and a full year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 265 properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet in 2018. 26 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , as compared to the same periods in 2018, primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 2019 2018 General and administrative $ 8,726 $ 8,543 2.1% $ 27,524 $ 25,980 5.9% Real estate 6,706 5,759 16.4% 20,398 17,449 16.9% Depreciation and amortization 48,348 42,479 13.8% 140,769 130,280 8.1% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 10,692 3,635 194.1% 21,124 9,718 117.4% Retirement severance costs — 222 (100.0)% — 743 (100.0)% Total operating expenses $ 74,472 $ 60,638 22.8% $ 209,815 $ 184,170 13.9% Interest and other income $ (501 ) $ (195 ) 156.9% $ (2,912 ) $ (258 ) 1,028.7% Interest expense 29,948 27,194 10.1% 89,716 80,906 10.9% Leasing transaction costs 51 — N/C (1) 178 — N/C (1) Total other expenses $ 29,498 $ 26,999 9.3% $ 86,982 $ 80,648 7.9% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.2 % 5.5 % 5.5 % 5.6 % Real estate 4.0 % 3.7 % 4.1 % 3.7 % (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 versus Quarter and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount but decreased as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in reimbursable expenses and expenses from certain properties that became vacant during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, and during the year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of 131 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,645,000 square feet in 2019 and 265 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet during 2018. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $21,124,000 and $9,718,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $10,692,000 and $3,635,000 was recorded during the quarters ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income increased in amount for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 , as compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increase is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale 27 of equity investments and $1,471,000 in interest income on cash balances recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense: (i) the issuance in September 2018 of $400,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of October 2028, and stated interest rate of 4.300%, (ii) the issuance in September 2018 of $300,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of October 2048, and stated interest rate of 4.800%, (iii) the redemption in October 2018 of $300,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of July 2021, and stated interest rate of 5.500%, and (iv) the decrease of $113,145,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility and a lower weighted average interest rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 399,032 $ 365,508 Used in investing activities (409,022 ) (293,741 ) Provided by financing activities 249,411 534,541 Increase 239,421 606,308 Net cash at beginning of period 114,267 1,364 Net cash at end of period $ 353,688 $ 607,672 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Revenue and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 , included the following significant transactions: • $379,410,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 7,000,000 shares of common stock in September, • $16,481,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 309,127 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), • $125,946,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 2,344,022 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (""ATM"") equity program, • $12,291,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN’s 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock""), • $13,455,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), and • $245,574,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. 28 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2019 . The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2019 . Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 2,886,982 $ 145 $ 596 $ 630 $ 325,664 $ 359,947 $ 2,200,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,019,854 28,095 112,365 112,331 109,724 91,308 566,031 Headquarters office lease 4,424 191 773 788 804 821 1,047 Ground leases 8,582 136 564 573 582 582 6,145 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,919,842 $ 28,567 $ 114,298 $ 114,322 $ 436,774 $ 452,658 $ 2,773,223 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 12 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at September 30, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 53,724 Less amount funded 24,943 Remaining commitment $ 28,781 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of September 30, 2019 , NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of September 30, 2019 , NNN owned 28 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of September 30, 2019 , less than one percent of the Property Portfolio is leased to one tenant that filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during 29 which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,097 $ 4,097 12,291 12,291 Per depositary share 0.356250 0.356250 1.068750 1.068750 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 13,455 13,455 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.975000 0.975000 Common stock: Dividends 83,935 78,253 245,574 223,836 Per share 0.515 0.500 1.515 1.450 (1) In October 2019, NNN redeemed the 5.700% Series E Preferred Stock, including all accrued and unpaid dividends through, but not including, the redemption date. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In October 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $0.515 per share which is payable in November 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of October 31, 2019 . Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): September 30, 2019 Percentage of Total December 31, 2018 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 12,221 0.4 % $ 12,694 0.4 % Notes payable 2,841,680 99.6 % 2,838,701 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 2,853,901 100.0 % $ 2,851,395 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $8,443,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.2% during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 . The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered 30 interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of September 30, 2019 , there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Common Stock Issuances. In September 2019, NNN filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in its February 2018 shelf registration statement and issued 7,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $56.50 per share and received net proceeds of $379,410,000. In connection with this offering, NNN incurred stock issuance costs totaling approximately $16,090,000, consisting primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, legal and accounting fees and printing expenses. In October 2019, NNN used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem all of its 11,500,000 outstanding depositary shares, each representing a 1/100th interest in a share of its Series E Preferred Stock. The Series E Preferred Stock was redeemed at $25.00 per depositary share, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions through, but not including, the redemption date, for an aggregate redemption price of $25.079167 per depositary share. In addition, NNN used the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Facility, to fund property acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 309,127 225,481 Net proceeds $ 16,481 $ 9,115 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of September 30, 2019 9,722,185 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 2,344,022 4,896,563 Average price per share (net) $ 53.73 $ 42.60 Net proceeds $ 125,946 $ 208,579 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 1,390 $ 2,792 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. 31 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the September 30, 2019 , condensed consolidated financial statements. 32 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of September 30, 2019 , NNN had three forward starting swaps with a total notional amount of $200,000,000 to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential issuance of long-term debt. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2019 . NNN had no outstanding balance on its variable rate Credit Facility as of September 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and had no other outstanding variable rate debt as of September 30, 2019. The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of September 30, 2019 , and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of September 30, 2019 , of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . NNN adopted the new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02 ""Leases (Topic 842)"" on January 1, 2019. The implementation of the new lease accounting standard included additions to NNN's internal controls, policies and procedures. There have been no other changes in NNN's internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 34 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . June 30, 2019 Property Portfolio: Total properties 3,043 Gross leasable area (square feet) 32,053,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.4 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 , may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 . Amounts as of December 31, 2018 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of properties developed by NNN includes costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 471,000 and $ 1,904,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $ 345,000 and $ 1,076,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired leased property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which 11 reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Intangible assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,717 $ 15,175 Less: accumulated amortization ( 9,604 ) ( 9,239 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 6,113 $ 5,936 In-place leases $ 115,642 $ 104,871 Less: accumulated amortization ( 62,400 ) ( 60,797 ) In-place leases, net $ 53,242 $ 44,074 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,737 $ 41,554 Less: accumulated amortization ( 25,595 ) ( 25,258 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 16,142 $ 16,296 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market in-place leases for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 401,000 and $ 2,115,000 , respectively, of which $ 173,000 and $ 1,417,000 were recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 4,042,000 and $ 5,516,000 , respectively, of which $ 1,798,000 and $ 2,370,000 were recorded for the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Lease Accounting – In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB issued final guidance that requires lessees to record a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset and lease liability on its balance sheets but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to previous accounting. The guidance also eliminated certain real estate-specific provisions and changed the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs for all entities. For lessors, the standard modified the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. Effective January 1, 2019, NNN adopted the lease guidance using the modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recognized at the date of initial application with a positive adjustment to NNN’s opening balance of accumulated deficit. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases upon adoption which in comparative periods approximates the results of a full retrospective approach. NNN elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance (which included: (i) an entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) an entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (iii) an entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases), the land easement practical expedient to carry forward existing accounting treatment on existing land easements, and the lease and non-lease component combined practical expedient. 12 NNN estimates the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probable collection. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019. Additional disclosures are included in Note 3 – Right-Of-Use-Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 are presented under the new standard, while comparative periods presented are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with NNN's historical accounting policy. ASC 842 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s $ 900,000,000 line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the line of credit as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Mortgages Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s mortgages payable have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. These costs of $ 147,000 as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , are included in mortgages payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 81,000 and $ 73,000 , respectively. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 26,932,000 , as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 7,819,000 and $ 6,705,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09, is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. Through the evaluation and implementation process, NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, NNN recognized revenue at the time of closing (i.e., transfer of asset). Following the adoption of ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on NNN's financial position and results of operations. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 13 The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 78,678 $ 70,573 $ 158,701 $ 173,854 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends ( 4,096 ) ( 4,096 ) ( 8,194 ) ( 8,194 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) ( 8,970 ) ( 8,970 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 70,097 61,992 141,537 156,690 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 134 ) ( 141 ) ( 249 ) ( 273 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 69,963 $ 61,851 $ 141,288 $ 156,417 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 162,697,005 154,593,456 162,243,958 154,138,711 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 265,981 ) ( 295,444 ) ( 249,480 ) ( 266,690 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 537,582 ) ( 487,320 ) ( 492,923 ) ( 443,656 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 161,893,442 153,810,692 161,501,555 153,428,365 Other dilutive securities 458,459 393,246 493,779 411,854 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share $ 162,351,901 154,203,938 161,995,334 153,840,219 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 14 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in thousands): Gain or Loss on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities Total Beginning balance, December 31, 2018 $ ( 6,911 ) $ 1,215 $ ( 5,696 ) Other comprehensive income ( 3,920 ) 116 ( 3,804 ) Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 648 (2) ( 1,331 ) (3) ( 683 ) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) ( 3,272 ) ( 1,215 ) ( 4,487 ) Ending balance, June 30, 2019 $ ( 10,183 ) $ — $ ( 10,183 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 6 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. (3) Recorded in interest and other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Management of NNN has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. NNN adopted certain practical expedients in ASC 842 which allows the presentation of all income earned pursuant to tenant leases to be included in rental income reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Note 2 – Real Estate: Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: June 30, 2019 Lease classification: Operating 3,062 Direct financing 7 Building portion – direct financing/land portion – operating 1 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.4 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years . The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. 15 Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,455,201 $ 2,371,925 Buildings and improvements 5,717,692 5,476,416 Leasehold interests 3,630 3,630 8,176,523 7,851,971 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,083,623 ) ( 1,008,772 ) 7,092,900 6,843,199 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 17,698 8,017 $ 7,110,598 $ 6,851,216 (1) Includes $ 14,686 and $ 5,571 in land for Properties under construction at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in rental income (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Rental income from operating leases $ 160,234 $ 150,969 $ 318,632 $ 298,798 Earned income from direct financing leases 208 225 420 455 Percentage rent 300 189 722 734 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,854 3,770 7,848 7,928 $ 164,596 $ 155,153 $ 327,622 $ 307,915 Some leases provide for scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , NNN recognized $ 925,000 and $ 710,000 , respectively, of such income, net of reserves, of which $ 296,000 and ($ 162,000 ) of such income, net of reserves, was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 28,198,000 and $ 25,387,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 1,842,000 . The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on noncancellable operating leases as of June 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 312,588 2020 637,801 2021 619,480 2022 589,653 2023 561,588 Thereafter 4,648,975 $ 7,370,085 Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the tenant, the above table only presents undiscounted cash flows due during the current lease terms. In addition, this table does not include amounts for potential variable rent increases that are based on the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") or future contingent rents which may be received on the leases based on a percentage of the tenant’s sales volume. 16 Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Direct Financing Method – The following lists the components of net investment in direct financing leases as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Minimum lease payments to be received $ 10,234 $ 10,899 Estimated unguaranteed residual values 3,632 4,395 Less unearned income ( 6,814 ) ( 7,225 ) Net investment in direct financing leases $ 7,052 $ 8,069 The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on direct financing leases held for investment as of June 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 734 2020 1,045 2021 920 2022 897 2023 895 Thereafter 5,743 $ 10,234 The table above does not include future minimum lease payments for renewal periods, potential variable CPI rent increases or contingent rental payments that may become due in future periods (see Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method). Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of June 30, 2019 , NNN had three of its Properties categorized as held for sale. NNN's real estate held for sale at December 31, 2018 , included six Properties, three of which were sold in 2019. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements $ 2,207 $ 10,808 Building and improvements 1,655 27,802 3,862 38,610 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 619 ) ( 7,499 ) Less impairment ( 2,955 ) ( 14,964 ) $ 288 $ 16,147 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 13 $ 13,002 13 $ 4,106 30 $ 23,447 28 $ 42,702 17 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 16 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months . These construction commitments, as of June 30, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 75,188 Less amount funded 32,384 Remaining commitment $ 42,804 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 10,432,000 and $ 6,083,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $ 7,187,000 and $ 3,835,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. Note 3 – Right-Of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities: NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognized an ROU asset (recorded in o ther assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in o ther liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. ROU assets represent NNN’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent NNN’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. NNN estimates an incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019 (the date of adoption of ASC 842) would not have a material impact on NNN’s financial position. NNN will reevaluate its incremental borrowing rate on an annual basis. NNN's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees. 18 As of June 30, 2019 , NNN has recorded the following (dollars in thousands): Ground Leases Headquarters Office Lease Operating lease – ROU assets (1) $ 4,612 $ 3,243 Operating lease – lease liabilities ( 6,318 ) ( 3,919 ) Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 14.7 5.8 Weighted average discount rate 4.1 % 3.5 % (1) ROU assets are shown net of accrued lease payments of $ 1,706 and $ 677 , respectively. The following is a schedule of the undiscounted cash flows to be paid as of June 30, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Ground Leases Headquarters Office Lease 2019 $ 272 $ 381 2020 564 773 2021 573 788 2022 582 804 2023 582 821 Thereafter 6,145 1,047 $ 8,718 $ 4,614 Note 4 – Line of Credit Payable : NNN's $ 900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $ 2,918,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.3 % during the six months ended June 30, 2019 . The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $ 1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of June 30, 2019 , $ 63,200,000 was outstanding and $ 836,800,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Note 5 – Stockholders' Equity : In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission"") which permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan – In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Commission for its Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP"") which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 137,316 143,997 Net proceeds $ 7,166 $ 5,471 At-The-Market Offerings – NNN has established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time.

Dividends – The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Series E preferred stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,096 $ 4,096 $ 8,194 $ 8,194 Per depositary share 0.356250 0.356250 0.712500 0.712500 Series F preferred stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 8,970 8,970 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.650000 0.650000 Common stock: Dividends 81,074 72,850 161,639 145,583 Per share 0.500 0.475 1.000 0.950 (1) The 5.700 % Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. As of May 2018, the Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by NNN. (2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.515 per share, which is payable in August 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2019 . Note 6 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. 20 NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re-designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. NNN records a cash settlement of forward starting swaps in the statement of cash flows as an operating activity. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of June 30, 2019 , $ 6,263,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 648,000 and $ 1,056,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 1,333,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. During the quarter ended June 30, 2019, NNN entered into one forward starting swap with a total notional amount of $ 90,000,000 to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential issuance of long-term debt. The outstanding forward swap was designated as cash flow hedge, and as of June 30, 2019 , had a fair value of $ 3,920,000 included in other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the forward starting swap was based on Level 2 valuation. This derivative financial instrument was still outstanding as of June 30, 2019 . NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. Note 7 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 3,009,145,000 and $ 2,813,583,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. 21 Note 8 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after June 30, 2019 , the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. In July 2019, the Company entered into one forward starting swap with an aggregate notional amount of $ 110,000,000 to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential issuance of long-term debt. The outstanding forward starting swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. There were no other reportable subsequent events or transactions. 22 Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of National Retail Properties, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2018 .

Additional information related to these risks and uncertainties are included in Item 1A. Risk Factors of NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 , and may cause NNN's actual future results to differ materially from expected results. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of June 30, 2019 , NNN owned 3,043 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 32,053,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years. Approximately 99 percent of the Properties were leased as of June 30, 2019 . NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 24 Results of Operations Property Analysis General.

The following table summarizes the Properties sold by NNN (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Number of properties 13 13 30 28 Gross leasable area (square feet) 313,000 72,000 493,000 352,000 Net sales proceeds $ 41,970 $ 11,915 $ 61,359 $ 83,520 Gain $ 13,002 $ 4,106 $ 23,447 $ 42,702 NNN typically uses the proceeds from a Property disposition to either pay down the Credit Facility or reinvest in real estate. Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 , total revenues increased, as compared to the same periods in 2018 , primarily due to the increase in income from Property acquisitions (See “Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions”). NNN anticipates increases in revenues will continue to come from additional Property acquisitions and increases in rents pursuant to existing lease terms. The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 2019 2018 Rental Revenues (1) $ 160,742 $ 151,383 6.2% $ 319,774 $ 299,987 6.6% Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,854 3,770 2.2% 7,848 7,928 (1.0%) Rental income 164,596 155,153 6.1% 327,622 307,915 6.4% Interest and other income from real estate transactions 196 365 (46.3%) 882 438 101.4% Total revenues $ 164,792 $ 155,518 6.0% $ 328,504 $ 308,353 6.5% (1) Includes rental income from operating leases, earned income from direct financing leases and percentage rent (""Rental Revenues""). Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 Rental Income. Rental income increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, is primarily due to a partial year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 104 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,112,000 during 2019 and a full year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 265 properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet in 2018. 26 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 , as compared to the same periods in 2018, primarily due to the increase in depreciation expense and impairment losses recognized on real estate. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses for the quarters and six months ended June 30 (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2019 2018 2019 2018 General and administrative $ 9,276 $ 8,741 6.1% $ 18,798 $ 17,437 7.8% Real estate 6,600 5,828 13.2% 13,692 11,690 17.1% Depreciation and amortization 46,241 43,304 6.8% 92,421 87,802 5.3% Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 7,187 3,835 87.4% 10,432 6,083 71.5% Retirement severance costs — 260 (100.0)% — 521 (100.0)% Total operating expenses $ 69,304 $ 61,968 11.8% $ 135,343 $ 123,533 9.6% Interest and other income $ (487 ) $ (37 ) 1,216.2% $ (2,411 ) $ (63 ) 3,727.0% Interest expense 29,811 27,110 10.0% 59,768 53,712 11.3% Leasing transaction costs 75 — N/C (1) 127 — N/C (1) Total other expenses $ 29,399 $ 27,073 8.6% $ 57,484 $ 53,649 7.1% As a percentage of total revenues: General and administrative 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.7 % Real estate 4.0 % 3.7 % 4.2 % 3.8 % (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 versus Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount but remained flat as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount and as a percentage of total revenues for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses from certain properties that became vacant during the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, and during the year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same periods in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of 104 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,112,000 square feet in 2019 and 265 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet during 2018. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $10,432,000 and $6,083,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, of which $7,187,000 and $3,835,000 was recorded during the quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income increased in amount for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 , as compared to the same periods in 2018 . The increase is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale of equity investments and $1,009,000 in interest income on cash balances recognized during the six months ended June 30, 2019. 27 Interest expense. Interest expense increased for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The following represents the primary changes in debt that have impacted interest expense: (i) the issuance in September 2018 of $400,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of October 2028, and stated interest rate of 4.300%, (ii) the issuance in September 2018 of $300,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of October 2048, and stated interest rate of 4.800%, (iii) the redemption in October 2018 of $300,000,000 principal amount of notes payable with a maturity of July 2021, and stated interest rate of 5.500%, and (iv) the decrease of $184,413,000 in the weighted average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility and a higher weighted average interest rate for the six months ended June 30, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 235,341 $ 228,231 Used in investing activities (317,836 ) (241,236 ) Provided by (used in) financing activities (29,563 ) 13,526 Increase (decrease) (112,058 ) 521 Net cash at beginning of period 114,267 1,364 Net cash at end of period $ 2,209 $ 1,885 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Income and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019 , included the following significant transactions: • $7,166,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 137,316 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), • $80,046,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 1,495,548 shares of common stock in connection with the at-the-market (""ATM"") equity program, • $8,194,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN’s 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock""), • $8,970,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), and • $161,639,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. 28 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of June 30, 2019 . The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of June 30, 2019 . Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 2,887,124 $ 287 $ 596 $ 630 $ 325,664 $ 359,947 $ 2,200,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,047,953 56,194 112,365 112,331 109,724 91,308 566,031 Credit Facility 63,200 — — — 63,200 — — Headquarters office lease 4,614 381 773 788 804 821 1,047 Ground leases 8,718 272 564 573 582 582 6,145 Total contractual cash obligations $ 4,011,609 $ 57,134 $ 114,298 $ 114,322 $ 499,974 $ 452,658 $ 2,773,223 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 16 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at June 30, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 75,188 Less amount funded 32,384 Remaining commitment $ 42,804 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of June 30, 2019 , NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectability of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of June 30, 2019 , NNN owned 37 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for approximately one percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of June 30, 2019 , less than one percent of the Property Portfolio is leased to one tenant that filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will 29 not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,096 $ 4,096 8,194 8,194 Per depositary share 0.356250 0.356250 0.712500 0.712500 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 8,970 8,970 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 0.650000 0.650000 Common stock: Dividends 81,074 72,850 161,639 145,583 Per share 0.500 0.475 1.000 0.950 (1) The Series E Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. As of May 2018, the Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by NNN. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In July 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $0.515 per share which is payable in August 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of July 31, 2019 . Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): June 30, 2019 Percentage of Total December 31, 2018 Percentage of Total Line of credit payable $ 63,200 2.2 % $ — — Mortgages payable 12,379 0.4 % 12,694 0.4 % Notes payable 2,840,674 97.4 % 2,838,701 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 2,916,253 100.0 % $ 2,851,395 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) had a weighted average outstanding balance of $2,918,000 and a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% during the six months ended June 30, 2019 . The 30 Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature which permits NNN to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000 , subject to lender approval. As of June 30, 2019 , $63,200,000 was outstanding and $836,800,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 137,316 143,997 Net proceeds $ 7,166 $ 5,471 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of June 30, 2019 8,873,711 The following table outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity programs (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Six Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 1,495,548 3,037,464 Average price per share (net) $ 53.52 $ 41.17 Net proceeds $ 80,046 $ 125,052 Stock issuance costs (1) $ 766 $ 1,633 (1) Stock issuance costs consist primarily of underwriters' fees and commissions, and legal and accounting fees. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the June 30, 2019 , condensed consolidated financial statements. 31 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of June 30, 2019 , NNN had one forward starting swap with a total notional amount of $90,000,000 to hedge the risk of changes in the interest-related cash outflows associated with the potential issuance of long-term debt. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of June 30, 2019 . The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of June 30, 2019 , and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates. If interest rates on NNN's variable rate debt increased by one percent, NNN's interest expense would have increased by less than one percent for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2023. 32 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of June 30, 2019 , of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . NNN adopted the new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02 ""Leases (Topic 842)"" on January 1, 2019. The implementation of the new lease accounting standard included additions to NNN's internal controls, policies and procedures. There have been no other changes in NNN's internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 33 PART II.

The terms ""NNN"" or the ""Company"" refer to National Retail Properties, Inc. and all of its consolidated subsidiaries. NNN's assets primarily include real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and primarily held for investment (""Properties"", ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property"") . March 31, 2019 Property Portfolio: Total properties 2,984 Gross leasable area (square feet) 30,698,000 States 48 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.4 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. Operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 , may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2019 . Amounts as of December 31, 2018 included in the condensed consolidated financial statements have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, included herein, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as well as Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in NNN's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . Principles of Consolidation – NNN’s condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of each of the respective majority owned and controlled affiliates, including transactions whereby NNN has been determined to be the primary beneficiary in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance included in Consolidation. All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated. Real Estate Portfolio – NNN records the acquisition of real estate at cost, including acquisition and closing costs. The cost of properties developed by NNN includes costs of construction, property taxes, interest and other miscellaneous costs incurred during the development period until the project is substantially complete and available for occupancy. NNN recorded $ 126,000 and $ 828,000 in capitalized interest during the development period for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Purchase Accounting for Acquisition of Real Estate Subject to a Lease – In accordance with the FASB guidance on business combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired with in-place leases is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and tenant improvements, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases and the value of in-place leases, as applicable, based on their respective fair values. The fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions, such as establishing a range of relevant market assumptions for land, building and rent and where the acquired property falls within that range. These market assumptions for land, building and rent use the most relevant comparable properties for an acquisition. The final range relies upon ranking comparable properties' attributes from most similar to least similar. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired leased property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the ""as-if-vacant"" value is then allocated to land, building and tenant improvements based on the determination of their fair values. In allocating the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, above-market and below-market in-place lease values are recorded as other assets or liabilities based on the present value (using an interest rate which 9 reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease and the applicable option terms if it is probable that the tenant will exercise options. The capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. The capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term unless the Company believes that it is likely that the tenant will renew the lease for an option term whereby the Company amortizes the value attributable to the renewal over the renewal period. The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets, consisting of in-place leases, is measured by the excess of (i) the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates over (ii) the estimated fair value of the property as-if-vacant, determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancelable periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be written off in that period. The value of tenant relationships is reviewed on individual transactions to determine if future value was derived from the acquisition. Intangible assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Intangible lease assets (included in other assets ): Above-market in-place leases $ 15,456 $ 15,175 Less: accumulated amortization ( 9,404 ) ( 9,239 ) Above-market in-place leases, net $ 6,052 $ 5,936 In-place leases $ 109,558 $ 104,871 Less: accumulated amortization ( 61,344 ) ( 60,797 ) In-place leases, net $ 48,214 $ 44,074 Intangible lease liabilities (included in other liabilities ): Below-market in-place leases $ 41,395 $ 41,554 Less: accumulated amortization ( 25,357 ) ( 25,258 ) Below-market in-place leases, net $ 16,038 $ 16,296 The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental income for above-market and below-market leases for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 228,000 and $ 698,000 , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized to expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , were $ 2,244,000 and $ 3,146,000 , respectively. Lease Accounting – In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (""ASC 842""), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The FASB issued final guidance that requires lessees to record a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset and lease liability on its balance sheets but recognize expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to previous accounting. The guidance also eliminated certain real estate-specific provisions and changed the guidance on sale-leaseback transactions, initial direct costs and lease executory costs for all entities. For lessors, the standard modified the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. Effective January 1, 2019, NNN adopted the lease guidance using the modified retrospective approach in which the cumulative effect of applying the new standard was recognized at the date of initial application with a positive adjustment to NNN’s opening balance of accumulated deficit. The modified retrospective approach provides a method for recording existing leases upon adoption which in comparative periods approximates the results of a full retrospective approach. NNN elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance (which included: (i) an entity need not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (ii) an entity need not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (iii) an entity need not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases), the land easement practical expedient to carry forward existing accounting treatment on existing land easements, and the lease and non-lease component combined practical expedient. NNN estimates the collectibility of its accounts receivable related to rents, expense reimbursements and other revenues. NNN analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels, tenant credit-worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the probable collection. At the point NNN deems the collection of lease payments not probable, a bad debt is 10 recognized for any outstanding receivable and any related accrued rent and, subsequently, any lease revenue is only recognized when cash receipts are received. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $ 7,735,000 and $ 10,155,000 respectively, as of January 1, 2019, additional disclosure is included in Note 3. The condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 are presented under the new standard, while comparative periods presented are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with NNN's historical accounting policy. ASC 842 did not materially impact NNN’s financial position, or results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. Debt Costs – Line of Credit Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s $ 900,000,000 line of credit have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. NNN has recorded debt costs associated with the line of credit as an asset, in debt costs on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt Costs – Mortgages Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with NNN’s mortgages payable have been deferred and are being amortized over the term of the respective loan commitment using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. These costs of $ 147,000 as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , are included in mortgages payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 77,000 and $ 73,000 , respectively. Debt Costs – Notes Payable – Debt costs incurred in connection with the issuance of NNN’s notes payable have been deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the respective debt obligation using the effective interest method. These costs of $ 26,932,000 , as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, are included in notes payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets net of accumulated amortization of $ 7,256,000 and $ 6,705,000 , respectively. Revenue Recognition – In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The core principle of ASU 2014-09, is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Certain contracts are excluded from ASU 2014-09, including lease contracts within the scope of the FASB guidance included in Leases (Topic 842). NNN adopted ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018, and applied the cumulative catch-up transition method. Through the evaluation and implementation process, NNN determined the key revenue stream impacted by ASU 2014-09 is gain on disposition of real estate reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2014-09, NNN recognized revenue at the time of closing (i.e., transfer of asset). Following the adoption of ASU 2014-09, NNN evaluates any separate contracts or performance obligations to determine proper timing and/or amount of revenue recognition, as well as, transaction price allocation. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have a material impact on NNN's financial position and results of operations. Earnings Per Share – Earnings per share have been computed pursuant to the FASB guidance included in Earnings Per Share . The guidance requires classification of the Company’s unvested restricted share units, which carry rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, as participating securities requiring the two-class method of computing earnings per share. Under the two-class method, earnings per common share are computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. 11 The following table is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Basic and Diluted Earnings: Net earnings attributable to NNN $ 80,023 $ 103,280 Less: Series E preferred stock dividends ( 4,097 ) ( 4,097 ) Less: Series F preferred stock dividends ( 4,485 ) ( 4,485 ) Net earnings available to NNN’s common stockholders 71,441 94,698 Less: Earnings allocated to unvested restricted shares ( 116 ) ( 147 ) Net earnings used in basic and diluted earnings per share $ 71,325 $ 94,551 Basic and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Weighted average number of shares outstanding 161,785,877 153,678,913 Less: Unvested restricted stock ( 232,795 ) ( 237,617 ) Less: Unvested contingent restricted shares ( 447,767 ) ( 400,240 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in basic earnings per share 161,105,315 153,041,056 Other dilutive securities 508,759 352,327 Weighted average number of shares outstanding used in diluted earnings per share 161,614,074 153,393,383 Fair Value Measurement – NNN’s estimates of fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework specifies a hierarchy of valuation inputs which was established to increase consistency, clarity and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures. The guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based upon three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value, two of which are considered observable and one that is considered unobservable. The following describes the three levels: • Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2 – Valuation is based upon inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. • Level 3 – Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) – The following table outlines the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (dollars in thousands): Gain or Loss on Cash Flow Hedges (1) Gains and Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities Total Beginning balance, December 31, 2018 $ ( 6,911 ) $ 1,215 $ ( 5,696 ) Other comprehensive income — 116 116 Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net earnings 323 (2) ( 1,331 ) (3) ( 1,008 ) Net current period other comprehensive income (loss) 323 ( 1,215 ) ( 892 ) Ending balance, March 31, 2019 $ ( 6,588 ) $ — $ ( 6,588 ) (1) Additional disclosure is included in Note 5 – Derivatives. (2) Recorded in interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. (3) Recorded in interest and other income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. Use of Estimates – Management of NNN has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Significant estimates include provisions for impairment and 12 allowances for certain assets, accruals, useful lives of assets and purchase price allocation. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassification – Certain items in the prior year’s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation. Note 2 – Real Estate: Real Estate – Portfolio Leases – The following outlines key information for NNN’s leases: March 31, 2019 Lease classification: Operating 2,986 Direct financing 7 Building portion – direct financing/land portion – operating 1 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.4 The following is a summary of the general structure of the leases in the Property Portfolio, although the specific terms of each lease can vary significantly. Generally, the Property leases provide for initial terms of 10 to 20 years . The Properties are generally leased under net leases, pursuant to which the tenant typically bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance, repair, replacement and operation of the property, including utilities, property taxes and property and liability insurance. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses of the Property. NNN's leases provide for annual base rental payments (generally payable in monthly installments), and generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of (i) increases in the Consumer Price Index (""CPI""), (ii) fixed increases, or, to a lesser extent, (iii) increases in the tenant’s sales volume. Generally, NNN's leases provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions provided under the initial lease term, including rent increases. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. Some of the leases also provide that in the event NNN wishes to sell the Property subject to that lease, NNN first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the Property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which NNN intends to accept for the sale of the Property. Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method – Real estate subject to operating leases consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements (1) $ 2,386,548 $ 2,368,635 Buildings and improvements 5,535,000 5,469,460 Leasehold interests 3,630 3,630 7,925,178 7,841,725 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 1,043,855 ) ( 1,005,724 ) 6,881,323 6,836,001 Work in progress for buildings and improvements 19,424 8,017 $ 6,900,747 $ 6,844,018 (1) Includes $ 10,846 and $ 5,571 in land for Properties under construction at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively. NNN recognized the following revenues in lease income for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands): Rental income from operating leases $ 158,398 Earned income from direct financing leases 213 Percentage rent 422 Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,993 $ 163,026 13 Some leases provide for scheduled rent increases throughout the lease term. Such amounts are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , NNN recognized $ 630,000 and $ 872,000 , respectively, of such income, net of reserves. At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the balance of accrued rental income was $ 28,120,000 and $ 25,387,000 , respectively, net of allowance of $ 1,842,000 , respectively. The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on noncancellable operating leases as of March 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 470,392 2020 617,630 2021 599,143 2022 569,341 2023 541,303 Thereafter 4,422,859 $ 7,220,668 Since lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the tenant, the above table only presents undiscounted cash flows due during the current lease terms. In addition, this table does not include amounts for potential variable rent increases that are based on the Consumer Price Index (""CPI"") or future contingent rents which may be received on the leases based on a percentage of the tenant’s sales volume. Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Direct Financing Method – The following lists the components of net investment in direct financing leases as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Minimum lease payments to be received $ 10,609 $ 10,899 Estimated unguaranteed residual values 3,632 4,395 Less unearned income ( 7,022 ) ( 7,225 ) Net investment in direct financing leases $ 7,219 $ 8,069 The following is a schedule of undiscounted cash flows to be received on direct financing leases held for investment as of March 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands): 2019 $ 1,109 2020 1,045 2021 920 2022 897 2023 895 Thereafter 5,743 $ 10,609 The table above does not include future minimum lease payments for renewal periods, potential variable CPI rent increases or contingent rental payments that may become due in future periods (see Real Estate Portfolio – Accounted for Using the Operating Method). 14 Real Estate – Held For Sale On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its Properties for held for sale classification based on specific criteria as outlined in ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, including management’s intent to commit to a plan to sell the asset. NNN anticipates the disposition of Properties classified as held for sale to occur within 12 months. As of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , NNN had seven of its Properties categorized as held for sale, respectively. Real estate held for sale consisted of the following as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Land and improvements $ 13,982 $ 13,976 Building and improvements 34,166 34,166 48,148 48,142 Less accumulated depreciation and amortization ( 10,608 ) ( 10,547 ) Less impairment ( 16,143 ) ( 14,250 ) $ 21,397 $ 23,345 Real Estate – Dispositions The following table summarizes the Properties sold and the corresponding gain recognized on the disposition of Properties (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 2018 # of Sold Properties Gain # of Sold Properties Gain Gain on disposition of real estate 17 $ 10,445 15 $ 38,596 Real Estate – Commitments NNN has committed to fund construction on 26 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months . These construction commitments, as of March 31, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 58,616 Less amount funded 30,270 Remaining commitment $ 28,346 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. Real Estate – Impairments Management periodically assesses its real estate for possible impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset, including accrued rental income, may not be recoverable through operations. Events or circumstances that may occur include significant changes in real estate market conditions and the ability of NNN to re-lease or sell properties that are vacant or become vacant in a reasonable period of time. Impairments are measured as the amount by which the current book value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. As a result of the Company's review of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $ 3,245,000 and $ 2,248,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The valuation of impaired assets is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis, income capitalization, analysis of recent comparable sales transactions, actual sales negotiations and bona fide purchase offers received from third parties, which are Level 3 inputs. NNN may consider a single valuation technique or multiple valuation techniques, as appropriate, when estimating the fair value of its real estate. 15 Note 3 – Right-Of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities: NNN is a lessee for three ground lease arrangements and for its headquarters office lease. NNN recognized an ROU asset (recorded in o ther assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) and an operating lease liability (recorded in o ther liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) for the present value of the minimum lease payments. ROU assets represent NNN’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent NNN’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. NNN’s lease term is based on the non-cancellable base term unless economic incentives make it reasonably certain that an option period to extend the lease will be exercised, in which event NNN includes the options. NNN estimates an incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. NNN gives consideration to the Company's debt issuances, as well as, publicly available data for secured instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in the estimate of the incremental borrowing rate at January 1, 2019 (the date of adoption of ASC 842) would not have a material impact on NNN’s financial position. NNN will reevaluate its incremental borrowing rate on an annual basis. NNN's lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.

(2) The 5.200 % Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock"") has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $ 0.500 per share, which is payable in May 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2019 . Note 5 – Derivatives : In accordance with the guidance on derivatives and hedging, NNN records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or a firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. NNN’s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks. To accomplish this objective, NNN primarily uses treasury locks, forward starting swaps and interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy. Treasury locks and forward starting swaps are used to hedge forecasted debt issuances. Treasury locks designated as cash flow hedges lock in the yield/price of a treasury security. Forward starting swaps also lock the associated swap spread. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with floating rate debt and involve the receipt or payment of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings) and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. NNN discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item, the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the derivative is re- 17 designated as a hedging instrument or management determines that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, NNN recognizes any changes in its fair value in earnings and continues to carry the derivative on the balance sheet or may choose to settle the derivative at that time with a cash payment or receipt. The following table outlines NNN's terminated derivatives which were hedging the risk of changes in forecasted interest payments on forecasted issuance of long-term debt (dollars in thousands): Terminated Description Aggregate Notional Amount Liability (Asset) Fair Value When Terminated Fair Value Deferred In Other Comprehensive Income (1) April 2013 Four forward starting swaps $ 240,000 $ 3,156 $ 3,141 May 2014 Three forward starting swaps 225,000 6,312 6,312 October 2015 Four forward starting swaps 300,000 13,369 13,369 December 2016 Two forward starting swaps 180,000 ( 13,352 ) ( 13,345 ) September 2017 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 7,690 7,688 September 2018 Two forward starting swaps 250,000 ( 4,080 ) ( 4,080 ) (1) The amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the related notes payable. As of March 31, 2019 , $ 6,588,000 remained in other comprehensive income related to NNN’s previously terminated interest rate hedges. During the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , NNN reclassified out of other comprehensive income $ 323,000 and $ 525,000 , respectively, as an increase in interest expense. Over the next 12 months, NNN estimates that an additional $ 1,317,000 will be reclassified as an increase in interest expense from these terminated derivatives. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on NNN’s long-term debt. NNN does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes or currently have any derivatives that are not designated as hedges. NNN had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at March 31, 2019 . Note 6 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments : NNN believes the carrying value of its Credit Facility approximates fair value based upon its nature, terms and variable interest rate. NNN believes that the carrying value of its mortgages payable at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , approximate fair value based upon current market prices of comparable instruments (Level 3). At March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , the fair value of NNN’s notes payable net of unamortized discount and excluding debt costs was $ 2,914,825,000 and $ 2,813,583,000 , respectively, based upon quoted market prices, which is a Level 1 valuation since NNN's notes payable are publicly traded. Note 7 – Subsequent Events : NNN reviewed its subsequent events and transactions that have occurred after March 31, 2019 , the date of the condensed consolidated balance sheet. There were no reportable subsequent events or transactions. 18 Item 2.

NNN undertakes no obligation to update or revise such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview NNN, a Maryland corporation, is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) formed in 1984. NNN's assets are primarily real estate assets. NNN acquires, owns, invests in and develops properties that are leased primarily to retail tenants under long-term net leases and are primarily held for investment (""Properties"" or ""Property Portfolio"", or individually a ""Property""). As of March 31, 2019 , NNN owned 2,984 Properties, with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 30,698,000 square feet, located in 48 states, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years. Approximately 98 percent of the Properties were leased as of March 31, 2019 . NNN’s management team focuses on certain key indicators to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. The key indicators for NNN include items such as: the composition of the Property Portfolio (such as tenant, geographic and line of trade diversification), the occupancy rate of the Property Portfolio, certain financial performance ratios and profitability measures, industry trends and industry performance compared to that of NNN. NNN evaluates the creditworthiness of its current and prospective tenants. This evaluation may include reviewing available financial statements, store level financial performance, press releases, public credit ratings from major credit rating agencies, industry news publications and financial market data (debt and equity pricing). NNN may also evaluate the business and operations of its tenants, including past payment history and periodically meeting with senior management of certain tenants. NNN continues to maintain its diversification by tenant, geography and tenant's line of trade. NNN’s largest lines of trade concentrations are the convenience store and restaurant (including full and limited service) sectors. These sectors represent a large part of the freestanding retail property marketplace and NNN’s management believes these sectors present attractive investment opportunities. The Property Portfolio is geographically concentrated in the south and southeast United States, which are regions of historically above-average population growth. Given these concentrations, any financial hardship within these sectors or geographic regions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and operating performance of NNN. 20 Results of Operations Property Analysis General. The following table summarizes the Property Portfolio: March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 Properties Owned: Number 2,984 2,969 2,800 Total gross leasable area (square feet) 30,698,000 30,487,000 29,116,000 Properties: Leased and unimproved land 2,931 2,917 2,777 Percent of Properties – leased and unimproved land 98 % 98 % 99 % Weighted average remaining lease term (years) 11.4 11.5 11.4 Total gross leasable area (square feet) – leased 29,618,000 29,439,000 28,752,000 The following table summarizes the diversification of the Property Portfolio based on the top 10 lines of trade: % of Annual Base Rent (1) Lines of Trade March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 March 31, 2018 1.

Analysis of Revenue General. During the quarter ended March 31, 2019 , total revenues increased, as compared to the same period in 2018 , primarily due to the increase in income from Property acquisitions (See “Results of Operations – Property Analysis – Property Acquisitions”). NNN anticipates increases in revenues will continue to come from additional Property acquisitions and increases in rents pursuant to existing lease terms. The following table summarizes NNN’s revenues (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percent of Total 2019 2018 2019 2018 Rental income from operating leases $ 158,398 $ 147,829 7.1% 96.8 % 96.7 % Earned income from direct financing leases 213 230 (7.4%) 0.1 % 0.1 % Percentage rent 422 546 (22.7%) 0.3 % 0.4 % Real estate expense reimbursement from tenants 3,993 4,158 (4.0%) 2.4 % 2.7 % Lease income (1) 163,026 (2) 99.6 % Interest and other income from real estate transactions 686 73 839.7% 0.4 % 0.1 % Total revenues $ 163,712 $ 152,836 7.1% 100.0 % 100.0 % (1) The condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 are presented under the new accounting standard, ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842),"" (“ASC 842”), while comparative periods presented are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with NNN's historical accounting policy. For the quarter ended March 31, 2019, lease revenues are included in lease income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income. (2) Lease income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 would have been $152,763. Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 Rental Income From Operating Leases. Rental income from operating leases increased in amount but remained flat as a percent of the total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, is primarily due to a partial year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 33 properties with aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 434,000 square feet during 2019 and a full year of rental income received as a result of the acquisition of 265 properties with a gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet in 2018. 22 Analysis of Expenses General. Operating expenses increased for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 , as compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense and real estate expenses. The following table summarizes NNN’s expenses (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) Percentage of Total Percentage of Revenues 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 General and administrative $ 9,521 $ 8,697 9.5% 14.4 % 14.1 % 5.8 % 5.7 % Real estate 7,093 5,862 21.0% 10.8 % 9.5 % 4.3 % 3.8 % Depreciation and amortization 46,180 44,498 3.8% 69.9 % 72.3 % 28.2 % 29.1 % Impairment losses – real estate, net of recoveries 3,245 2,248 44.4% 4.9 % 3.7 % 2.0 % 1.5 % Retirement severance costs — 261 (100.0%) — 0.4 % — 0.2 % Total operating expenses $ 66,039 $ 61,566 7.3% 100.0 % 100.0 % 40.3 % 40.3 % Interest and other income $ (1,924 ) $ (25 ) 7,596.0% (6.9 %) (0.1 %) (1.2 %) (0.1 %) Interest expense 29,957 26,602 12.6% 106.7 % 100.1 % 18.3 % 17.5 % Leasing transaction costs 52 — N/C (1) 0.2 % — — — Total other expenses $ 28,085 $ 26,577 5.7% 100.0 % 100.0 % 17.1 % 17.4 % (1) Not calculable (""N/C"") Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 versus Quarter Ended March 31, 2018 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased in amount, as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, is primarily attributable to an increase in compensation costs. Real Estate. Real estate expenses increased in amount, as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily attributable to expenses from certain properties that became vacant during the quarter ended March 31, 2019, and during the year ended December 31, 2018. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased in amount, but decreased as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase in expenses is primarily due to the acquisition of 33 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 434,000 square feet in 2019 and 265 properties with an aggregate gross leasable area of approximately 2,167,000 square feet during 2018. Impairment Losses – real estate, net of recoveries. NNN reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that may occur include changes in real estate market conditions, the ability of NNN to re-lease properties that are currently vacant or become vacant, and the ability to sell properties at a price that exceeds NNN's carrying value. Management evaluates whether an impairment in value has occurred by comparing the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges), and the residual value of the real estate, with the carrying cost of the individual asset. If an impairment is indicated, a loss will be recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. NNN recognized real estate impairments, net of recoveries of $3,245,000 and $2,248,000 for the quarters ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income increased in amount, as a percentage of total operating expenses and as a percentage of revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, as compared to the same period in 2018. The increase is primarily due to the gain of $1,331,000 on sale of equity investments and $560,000 in interest income on cash balances. Liquidity General . NNN’s demand for funds has been, and will continue to be, primarily for (i) payment of operating expenses and cash dividends; (ii) Property acquisitions and development; (iii) capital expenditures; (iv) payment of principal and interest on its outstanding indebtedness; and (v) other investments. 23 Cash and Cash Equivalents. NNN's cash and cash equivalents includes the aggregate of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash held in escrow from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The table below summarizes NNN’s cash flows (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents: Provided by operating activities $ 143,376 $ 129,997 Used in investing activities (93,030 ) (103,152 ) Used in financing activities (84,092 ) (24,207 ) Increase (decrease) (33,746 ) 2,638 Net cash at beginning of period 114,267 1,364 Net cash at end of period $ 80,521 $ 4,002 Cash provided by operating activities represents cash received primarily from Rental Income and interest income less cash used for general and administrative expenses. NNN’s cash flow from operating activities has been sufficient to pay the distributions for each period presented. The change in cash provided by operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , is primarily the result of changes in revenues and expenses as discussed in “Results of Operations.” Cash generated from operations is expected to fluctuate in the future. Changes in cash for investing activities are primarily attributable to the acquisitions and dispositions of Properties. NNN typically uses proceeds from its Credit Facility to fund the acquisition of its Properties. NNN’s financing activities for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 , included the following significant transactions: • $5,279,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of 101,180 shares of common stock in connection with the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (""DRIP""), • $4,097,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN’s 5.700% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series E Preferred Stock""), • $4,485,000 in dividends paid to holders of the depositary shares of NNN's 5.200% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the ""Series F Preferred Stock""), and • $80,566,000 in dividends paid to common stockholders. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments . The information in the following table summarizes NNN’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2019 . The table presents principal cash flows by year-end of the expected maturity for debt obligations and commercial commitments outstanding as of March 31, 2019 . Expected Maturity Date (dollars in thousands) Total 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Long-term debt (1) $ 2,887,263 $ 426 $ 596 $ 630 $ 325,664 $ 359,947 $ 2,200,000 Long-term debt – interest (2) 1,076,054 84,295 112,365 112,331 109,724 91,308 566,031 Headquarters office lease 4,805 572 773 788 804 821 1,047 Ground leases 8,249 364 511 520 530 530 5,794 Total contractual cash obligations $ 3,976,371 $ 85,657 $ 114,245 $ 114,269 $ 436,722 $ 452,606 $ 2,772,872 (1) Includes only principal amounts outstanding under mortgages payable and notes payable and excludes unamortized mortgage premiums, note discounts and note costs. (2) Interest calculation based on stated rate of the principal amount. 24 In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, NNN has committed to fund construction on 26 Properties. The improvements on such Properties are estimated to be completed within 12 months. These construction commitments, at March 31, 2019 , are outlined in the table below (dollars in thousands): Total commitment (1) $ 58,616 Less amount funded 30,270 Remaining commitment $ 28,346 (1) Includes land, construction costs, tenant improvements, lease costs and capitalized interest. As of March 31, 2019 , NNN did not have any other material contractual cash obligations, such as purchase obligations, financing lease obligations or other long-term liabilities other than those reflected in the tables above and previously disclosed under Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 . In addition to items reflected in the tables, NNN has issued preferred stock with cumulative preferential cash distributions, as described below under “Dividends.” Management anticipates satisfying these obligations with a combination of NNN’s cash provided from operations, current capital resources on hand, its credit facility, debt or equity financings and asset dispositions. Generally, the Properties are leased under long-term net leases, which require the tenant to pay all property taxes and assessments, to maintain the interior and exterior of the property, and to carry property and liability insurance coverage. Therefore, management anticipates that capital demands to meet obligations with respect to these Properties will be modest for the foreseeable future and can be met with funds from operations and working capital. Certain Properties are subject to leases under which NNN retains responsibility for specific costs and expenses associated with the Property. Management anticipates that the costs associated with these Properties, NNN's vacant Properties or those Properties that become vacant will also be met with funds from operations and working capital. NNN may be required to borrow under its credit facility or use other sources of capital in the event of significant capital expenditures. The lost revenues and increased property expenses resulting from vacant Properties or uncollectibility of lease revenues could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and results of operations if NNN is unable to re-lease the Properties at comparable rental rates and in a timely manner. As of March 31, 2019 , NNN owned 53 vacant, un-leased Properties which accounted for less than two percent of total Properties held in the Property Portfolio. Additionally, as of March 31, 2019 , less than one percent of the Property Portfolio is leased to one tenant that filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result, this tenant has the right to reject or affirm their leases with NNN. NNN generally monitors the financial performance of its significant tenants on an ongoing basis. Dividends. NNN has made an election to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, as amended, and related regulations and intends to continue to operate so as to remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. NNN generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes to its stockholders, provided that it distributes 100 percent of its REIT taxable income and meets certain other requirements for qualifying as a REIT. If NNN fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four years following the year during which qualification is lost. Such an event could materially adversely affect NNN’s income and ability to pay dividends. NNN believes it has been structured as, and its past and present operations qualify NNN as, a REIT. One of NNN’s primary objectives, consistent with its policy of retaining sufficient cash for reserves and working capital purposes and maintaining its status as a REIT, is to distribute a substantial portion of its funds available from operations to its stockholders in the form of dividends. 25 The following table outlines the dividends declared and paid for each issuance of NNN's stock (dollars in thousands, except per share data): Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Series E Preferred Stock (1) : Dividends $ 4,097 $ 4,097 Per depositary share 0.356250 0.356250 Series F Preferred Stock (2) : Dividends 4,485 4,485 Per depositary share 0.325000 0.325000 Common stock: Dividends 80,566 72,733 Per share 0.500 0.475 (1) The Series E Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. As of May 2018, the Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by NNN. (2) The Series F Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless redeemed by NNN. The earliest redemption date for the Series F Preferred Stock is October 2021. In April 2019 , NNN declared a dividend of $0.500 per share which is payable in May 2019 to its common stockholders of record as of April 30, 2019 . Capital Resources Generally, cash needs for Property acquisitions, debt payments, capital expenditures, development and other investments have been funded by equity and debt offerings, bank borrowings, the sale of Properties and, to a lesser extent, by internally generated funds. Cash needs for operating and interest expenses and dividends have generally been funded by internally generated funds. If available, future sources of capital include proceeds from the public or private offering of NNN’s debt or equity securities, secured or unsecured borrowings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from the sale of Properties, as well as undistributed funds from operations. Debt The following is a summary of NNN’s total outstanding debt as of (dollars in thousands): March 31, 2019 Percentage of Total December 31, 2018 Percentage of Total Mortgages payable $ 12,536 0.4 % $ 12,694 0.4 % Notes payable 2,839,678 99.6 % 2,838,701 99.6 % Total outstanding debt $ 2,852,214 100.0 % $ 2,851,395 100.0 % Indebtedness. NNN expects to use indebtedness primarily for property acquisitions and development of single-tenant retail properties, either directly or through investment interests. Additionally indebtedness may be used to refinance existing indebtedness. Line of Credit Payable. NNN's $900,000,000 unsecured revolving Credit Facility had no weighted average outstanding balance and no weighted average interest rate during the quarter ended March 31, 2019. The Credit Facility matures January 2022, unless the Company exercises its option to extend maturity to January 2023. The Credit Facility currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points; however, such interest rate may change pursuant to a tiered interest rate structure based on NNN's debt rating. The Credit Facility also includes an accordion feature to increase the facility size up to $1,600,000,000, subject to lender approval. As of March 31, 2019, there was no outstanding balance and $900,000,000 was available for future borrowings under the Credit Facility. 26 Debt and Equity Securities NNN has used, and expects to use in the future, issuances of debt and equity securities primarily to pay down its outstanding indebtedness and to finance acquisitions. Securities Offerings. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) which was automatically effective and permits the issuance by NNN of an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities. Information related to NNN's publicly held debt and equity securities is included in NNN's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In February 2018, NNN filed a shelf registration statement which was automatically effective with the Commission for its DRIP, which permits the issuance by NNN of up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock. NNN’s DRIP provides an economical and convenient way for current stockholders and other interested new investors to invest in NNN’s common stock. The following outlines the common stock issuances pursuant to NNN’s DRIP (dollars in thousands): Quarter Ended March 31, 2019 2018 Shares of common stock 101,180 44,659 Net proceeds $ 5,279 $ 1,491 At-The-Market Offerings. NNN established an at-the-market equity program (""ATM"") which allows NNN to sell shares of common stock from time to time. The following outlines NNN's ATM program: 2018 ATM Established date February 2018 Termination date February 2021 Total allowable shares 12,000,000 Total shares issued as of March 31, 2019 7,378,163 There were no common stock issuances pursuant to NNN's ATM equity program for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 1 to the March 31, 2019 , Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk NNN is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of its variable rate Credit Facility and its fixed rate debt which is used to finance NNN’s development and acquisition activities, as well as for general corporate purposes. NNN’s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve its objectives, NNN borrows at both fixed and variable rates on its long-term debt. As of March 31, 2019 , NNN had no outstanding derivatives. The information in the table below summarizes NNN’s market risks associated with its debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 . The table presents principal payments and related interest rates by year for debt obligations outstanding as of March 31, 2019 . NNN had no outstanding balance on its variable rate Credit Facility as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 , respectively, and had no other outstanding variable rate debt as of March 31, 2019 . The table incorporates only those debt obligations that existed as of March 31, 2019 , and it does not consider those debt obligations or positions which could arise after this date and therefore has limited predictive value. As a result, NNN’s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period, NNN’s hedging strategies at that time and interest rates.

NNN uses market prices quoted from Bloomberg, a third party, which is a Level 1 input, to determine the fair value. (3) Weighted average effective interest rate for periods after 2023. 28 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of NNN's management, including NNN's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness as of March 31, 2019 , of the design and operation of NNN's disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . NNN adopted the new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02 ""Leases (Topic 842)"" on January 1, 2019. The implementation of the new lease accounting standard included additions to NNN's internal controls, policies and procedures. There have been no other changes in NNN's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect NNN's internal control over financial reporting. 29 PART II.
