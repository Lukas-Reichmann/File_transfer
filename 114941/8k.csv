(NYSE: DPZ), the largest pizza company in the world, announced results for the third quarter of 2023. Global retail sales grew 4.9% in the third quarter of 2023, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, and grew 5.1% in the third quarter of 2023, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency and the closure of the Russia market. Without adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, but excluding the closure of the Russia market, global retail sales grew 5.3% in the third quarter of 2023. U.S. same store sales declined 0.6% during the third quarter of 2023. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) grew 3.3% during the third quarter of 2023. Diluted EPS for the third quarter of 2023 was $4.18, an increase of 49.8% over the prior year quarter. The Company had third quarter global net store decline of 8 stores, comprised of 27 net U.S. store openings and 35 net international store closures. The Company had 218 gross store openings and 226 gross store closures during the third quarter of 2023. Global and international net store decline reflects the closure of the remaining 143 net Domino’s stores in Russia. Excluding the impact of the closure of the Russia market, the Company had third quarter global net store growth of 135 stores, comprised of 27 net U.S. store openings and 108 net international store openings. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company’s master franchisee that owned and operated Domino’s Pizza ® stores in Russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market, and, as a result, the Company has excluded the impact of the Russia market from its fiscal 2023 statistical measures, including net store growth, global retail sales growth and global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact. The Company has not received any royalties and fees from the operations of the Russia market subsequent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2023, on October 10, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $1.21 per share quarterly dividend on its outstanding common stock for shareholders of record as of December 15, 2023, to be paid on December 29, 2023. The Company will host its Investor Day on December 7, 2023 at the Company’s headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan. “We continue to execute on our initiatives to drive sustainable growth in the U.S.,” said Russell Weiner, Domino’s Chief Executive Officer. “Our ‘Summer of Service’ initiative and the hard work of our franchisees and team members have brought delivery times back to pre-pandemic levels.

The Company invested $59.3 million in capital expenditures during the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to $50.5 million during the three fiscal quarters of 2022. Free cash flow, as reconciled below to net cash provided by operating activities, as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), was approximately $362.9 million during the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to $279.6 million during the three fiscal quarters of 2022 (refer to Comments on Regulation G below for additional details). (In thousands) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 422,130 $ 330,154 Capital expenditures (59,271 ) (50,508 ) Free cash flow $ 362,859 $ 279,646 Free cash flow increased $83.2 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net income, excluding non-cash operating activities, partially offset by higher investments in capital expenditures. Two- to Three-Year Outlook - 2023 Update Based on actual results for the three fiscal quarters of 2023 and the Company’s outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023, the Company expects its 2023 global net store growth to trend at or slightly below the low-end of its 5% to 7% two- to three-year outlook. Additionally, the Company expects its 2023 global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, to trend modestly below the mid-point of its 4% to 8% two -to three-year outlook. Russia Market Update On August 21, 2023, the Company’s master franchisee that owned and operated Domino’s Pizza ® stores in Russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. Therefore, as of August 21, 2023, the Company has considered the stores in the Russia market to be closed and they are excluded from the Company’s ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The Company has disclosed its statistical measure of net store growth for the third quarter and trailing four quarters ended September 10, 2023 including and excluding the impact of the closure of the Russia market. Additionally, the Company has presented its statistical measures of global retail sales growth and global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, in the tables above for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 10, 2023 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the Russia market. The Company believes the impact of the Russia market on its statistical measures of global retail sales growth and global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 11, 2022 was immaterial and prior amounts have not been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. The Company believes the impact of the Russia market on its statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and it also believes the impact of the Russia market on its condensed consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the periods presented was immaterial. Refer to Comments on Regulation G below for additional details. Comments on Regulation G In addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, the Company has included non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, including free cash flow. The Company has also included metrics such as global retail sales, global retail sales growth, global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, same store sales growth, the market basket pricing change and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues which are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding Company performance. The Company uses “Global retail sales,” a statistical measure, to refer to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. The Company believes global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. The Company reviews comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the Company by its franchisees and are not included in Company revenues. “Global retail sales growth” is calculated as the change of U.S. Dollar global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. “Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact” is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. The 2023 global retail sales growth measures excluding the Russia market are calculated as the growth in retail sales excluding the retail sales from the Russia market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales base. The Company uses “Same store sales growth,” a statistical measure, which is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification. The Company uses “Net store growth,"" a statistical measure, which is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth. The Company uses “Market basket pricing change,” a statistical measure, which is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. The Company believes that the market basket pricing change is important to investors and other interested persons to understand the Company’s performance. As market basket prices fluctuate, revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in the Company’s supply chain segment also fluctuate. Additionally, cost of sales, gross margins and gross margin percentages for the Company’s U.S. Company-owned stores also fluctuate. The Company uses “Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues,” a statistical measure, which is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current period local currency results to U.S. dollars at current period exchange rates as compared to prior period exchange rates. The Company believes that the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues is important to investors and other interested persons to understand the Company’s international royalty revenues given the significant variability in those revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchanges rates. The Company uses “Free cash flow,” which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, both as reported under GAAP. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors and other interested persons, and that such persons benefit from having a measure which communicates how much cash flow is available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing debt, making acquisitions, repurchasing common stock or paying dividends.

U.S. same store sales declined 0.6% during the third quarter of 2023. International same store sales (excluding foreign currency impact) grew 3.3% during the third quarter of 2023.

The Company had 218 gross store openings and 226 gross store closures during the third quarter of 2023.

(In thousands) Three Fiscal Quarters of 2023 Three Fiscal Quarters of 2022 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 422,130 $ 330,154 Capital expenditures (59,271 ) (50,508 ) Free cash flow $ 362,859 $ 279,646 Free cash flow increased $83.2 million in the three fiscal quarters of 2023 as compared to the three fiscal quarters of 2022, primarily due to the positive impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities and higher net income, excluding non-cash operating activities, partially offset by higher investments in capital expenditures. Two- to Three-Year Outlook - 2023 Update Based on actual results for the three fiscal quarters of 2023 and the Company’s outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023, the Company expects its 2023 global net store growth to trend at or slightly below the low-end of its 5% to 7% two- to three-year outlook. Additionally, the Company expects its 2023 global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, to trend modestly below the mid-point of its 4% to 8% two -to three-year outlook. Russia Market Update On August 21, 2023, the Company’s master franchisee that owned and operated Domino’s Pizza ® stores in Russia announced its intent to file for bankruptcy with respect to the stores in that market. Therefore, as of August 21, 2023, the Company has considered the stores in the Russia market to be closed and they are excluded from the Company’s ending store count as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The Company has disclosed its statistical measure of net store growth for the third quarter and trailing four quarters ended September 10, 2023 including and excluding the impact of the closure of the Russia market. Additionally, the Company has presented its statistical measures of global retail sales growth and global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, in the tables above for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 10, 2023 excluding the impact of the retail sales from the Russia market. The Company believes the impact of the Russia market on its statistical measures of global retail sales growth and global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, for the fiscal quarter and three fiscal quarters ended September 11, 2022 was immaterial and prior amounts have not been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. The Company believes the impact of the Russia market on its statistical measure of same store sales growth for the periods presented was immaterial, and it also believes the impact of the Russia market on its condensed consolidated statements of income related to international franchise royalties and fee revenues and general and administrative expenses for the periods presented was immaterial. Refer to Comments on Regulation G below for additional details. Comments on Regulation G In addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, the Company has included non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, including free cash flow. The Company has also included metrics such as global retail sales, global retail sales growth, global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, same store sales growth, the market basket pricing change and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues which are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding Company performance. The Company uses “Global retail sales,” a statistical measure, to refer to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. The Company believes global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties and advertising fees that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. The Company reviews comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino’s Pizza brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the Company by its franchisees and are not included in Company revenues. “Global retail sales growth” is calculated as the change of U.S. Dollar global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. “Global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact” is calculated as the change of international local currency global retail sales against the comparable period of the prior year. The 2023 global retail sales growth measures excluding the Russia market are calculated as the growth in retail sales excluding the retail sales from the Russia market from both 2023 retail sales and the 2022 retail sales base. The Company uses “Same store sales growth,” a statistical measure, which is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable weeks of both periods. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to U.S. same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales. Same store sales growth for transferred stores is reflected in their current classification. The Company uses “Net store growth,"" a statistical measure, which is calculated by netting gross store openings with gross store closures during the period. Transfers between Company-owned stores and franchised stores are excluded from the calculation of net store growth. The Company uses “Market basket pricing change,” a statistical measure, which is calculated as the percentage change of the market basket purchased by an average U.S. store (based on average weekly unit sales) from U.S. supply chain centers against the comparable period of the prior year. The Company believes that the market basket pricing change is important to investors and other interested persons to understand the Company’s performance. As market basket prices fluctuate, revenues, cost of sales and gross margin percentages in the Company’s supply chain segment also fluctuate. Additionally, cost of sales, gross margins and gross margin percentages for the Company’s U.S. Company-owned stores also fluctuate. The Company uses “Impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues,” a statistical measure, which is calculated as the difference in international franchise royalty revenues resulting from translating current period local currency results to U.S. dollars at current period exchange rates as compared to prior period exchange rates. The Company believes that the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on international franchise royalty revenues is important to investors and other interested persons to understand the Company’s international royalty revenues given the significant variability in those revenues that can be driven by changes in foreign currency exchanges rates. The Company uses “Free cash flow,” which is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, both as reported under GAAP. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors and other interested persons, and that such persons benefit from having a measure which communicates how much cash flow is available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing debt, making acquisitions, repurchasing common stock or paying dividends.

We run our business with a long-term focus, characterized by consistent per share growth on a multi-year basis, and our guidance for 2019 and 2020 reflects that consistent philosophy.” National Retail Properties invests primarily in high-quality retail properties subject generally to long-term, net leases.

In addition, a summary of any earnings guidance given on the call will be posted to the company’s web site. Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical are “forward-looking” statements. These statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""estimated,"" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the company’s actual future results to differ materially from expected results. These risks include, among others, general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, changes in interest rates, increases in operating costs, the preferences and financial condition of the company's tenants, the availability of capital, and, risks related to the company's status as a REIT. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission”) filings, including, but not limited to, the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the Commission. Such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company’s current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. National Retail Properties, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made. The reported results are preliminary and not final and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made. Funds From Operations, commonly referred to as FFO, is a relative non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and is used by the company as follows: net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry, excluding gains (or 2 including losses), any applicable taxes and noncontrolling interests on the disposition of certain assets, the company’s share of these items from the company’s unconsolidated partnerships and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset. FFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the company’s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The company’s computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance that adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of certain GAAP income and expense amounts that the company believes are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to its core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a potential metric to assist in their evaluation of the company’s operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of its peers because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact the company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of the company’s core business operations and is a factor in determining management compensation. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO may include items like transaction related gains, income or expense, impairments on land or commercial mortgage residual interests, preferred stock redemption costs or other non-core amounts as they occur. The company’s computation of Core FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating Core FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to Core FFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the company’s performance. The company’s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. 3 National Retail Properties, Inc.

The reported results are preliminary and not final and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2019 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made. Funds From Operations, commonly referred to as FFO, is a relative non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and is used by the company as follows: net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry, excluding gains (or 2 including losses), any applicable taxes and noncontrolling interests on the disposition of certain assets, the company’s share of these items from the company’s unconsolidated partnerships and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset. FFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the company’s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The company’s computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance that adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of certain GAAP income and expense amounts that the company believes are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to its core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a potential metric to assist in their evaluation of the company’s operating performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of its peers because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact the company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of the company’s core business operations and is a factor in determining management compensation. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO may include items like transaction related gains, income or expense, impairments on land or commercial mortgage residual interests, preferred stock redemption costs or other non-core amounts as they occur. The company’s computation of Core FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating Core FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to Core FFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the company’s performance. The company’s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. 3 National Retail Properties, Inc.

As of June 30, 2019 , the company owned 3,043 properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of approximately 32.1 million square feet and with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years. For more information on the company, visit www.nnnreit.com. Management will hold a conference call on August 1, 2019 , at 10:30 a.m . ET to review these results. The call can be accessed on the National Retail Properties web site live at http://www.nnnreit.com.

In addition, a summary of any earnings guidance given on the call will be posted to the company’s web site. Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical are “forward-looking” statements. These statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""estimated,"" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the company’s actual future results to differ materially from expected results. These risks include, among others, general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, changes in interest rates, increases in operating costs, the preferences and financial condition of the company's tenants, the availability of capital, and, risks related to the company's status as a REIT. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission”) filings, including, but not limited to, the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the Commission. Such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company’s current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. National Retail Properties, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made. The reported results are preliminary and not final and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made. Funds From Operations, commonly referred to as FFO, is a relative non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and is used by the company as follows: net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry, excluding gains (or including losses), any applicable taxes and noncontrolling interests on the disposition of certain assets, the company’s share of these items from the company’s unconsolidated partnerships and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset. FFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the company’s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The company’s computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance that adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of certain GAAP income and expense amounts that the company believes are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to its core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a potential metric to assist in their evaluation of the company’s operating 2 performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of its peers because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact the company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of the company’s core business operations and is a factor in determining management compensation. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO may include items like transaction related gains, income or expense, impairments on land or commercial mortgage residual interests, preferred stock redemption costs or other non-core amounts as they occur. The company’s computation of Core FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating Core FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to Core FFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the company’s performance. The company’s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. 3 National Retail Properties, Inc.

In July, we increased our common stock dividend by three percent to 51.5 cents per quarter, while maintaining our very conservative dividend payout ratio. 2019 will mark our 30 th consecutive year of increased annual dividends, a feat matched by only two other REITs and by less than 90 public companies in the United States.” National Retail Properties invests primarily in high-quality retail properties subject generally to long-term, net leases. As of June 30, 2019 , the company owned 3,043 properties in 48 states with a gross leasable area of approximately 32.1 million square feet and with a weighted average remaining lease term of 11.4 years. For more information on the company, visit www.nnnreit.com. Management will hold a conference call on August 1, 2019 , at 10:30 a.m . ET to review these results. The call can be accessed on the National Retail Properties web site live at http://www.nnnreit.com. For those unable to listen to the live broadcast, a replay will be available on the company’s web site. In addition, a summary of any earnings guidance given on the call will be posted to the company’s web site. Statements in this press release that are not strictly historical are “forward-looking” statements. These statements generally are characterized by the use of terms such as ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""estimated,"" or other similar words or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, which may cause the company’s actual future results to differ materially from expected results. These risks include, among others, general economic conditions, local real estate conditions, changes in interest rates, increases in operating costs, the preferences and financial condition of the company's tenants, the availability of capital, and, risks related to the company's status as a REIT. Additional information concerning these and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""Commission”) filings, including, but not limited to, the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the Commission. Such forward-looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company’s current operating plans and estimates. Actual operating results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in this press release. National Retail Properties, Inc. undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date these statements were made. The reported results are preliminary and not final and there can be no assurance that the results will not vary from the final information filed on Form 10-Q with the Commission for the quarter and six months ended June 30, 2019 . In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of these reported results have been made. Funds From Operations, commonly referred to as FFO, is a relative non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance of an equity REIT in order to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under GAAP. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and is used by the company as follows: net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry, excluding gains (or including losses), any applicable taxes and noncontrolling interests on the disposition of certain assets, the company’s share of these items from the company’s unconsolidated partnerships and any impairment charges on a depreciable real estate asset. FFO is generally considered by industry analysts to be the most appropriate measure of performance of real estate companies. FFO does not necessarily represent cash provided by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net earnings as an indication of the company’s performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers FFO an appropriate measure of performance of an equity REIT because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure. The company’s computation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Core Funds From Operations (“Core FFO”) is a non-GAAP measure of operating performance that adjusts FFO to eliminate the impact of certain GAAP income and expense amounts that the company believes are infrequent and unusual in nature and/or not related to its core real estate operations. Exclusion of these items from similar FFO-type metrics is common within the REIT industry, and management believes that presentation of Core FFO provides investors with a potential metric to assist in their evaluation of the company’s operating 2 performance across multiple periods and in comparison to the operating performance of its peers because it removes the effect of unusual items that are not expected to impact the company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis. Core FFO is used by management in evaluating the performance of the company’s core business operations and is a factor in determining management compensation. Items included in calculating FFO that may be excluded in calculating Core FFO may include items like transaction related gains, income or expense, impairments on land or commercial mortgage residual interests, preferred stock redemption costs or other non-core amounts as they occur. The company’s computation of Core FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating Core FFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to Core FFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. AFFO adjusts FFO for certain non-cash items that reduce or increase net income in accordance with GAAP. AFFO should not be considered an alternative to net earnings, as an indication of the company's performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Management considers AFFO a useful supplemental measure of the company’s performance. The company’s computation of AFFO may differ from the methodology for calculating AFFO used by other equity REITs, and therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net earnings (computed in accordance with GAAP) to AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this release. 3 National Retail Properties, Inc.
