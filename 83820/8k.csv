The “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our most recent annual report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides a more complete description of our risks. The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current outlook. Current Guidance Q1 FY24 Estimates 1 Revenues $9.1B - $9.9B Supplemental Revenue Information QCT revenues $7.7B - $8.3B QTL revenues $1.3B - $1.5B GAAP diluted EPS $1.82 - $2.02 Less diluted EPS attributable to QSI $— Less diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation ($0.45) Less diluted EPS attributable to other items 2 $0.02 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $2.25 - $2.45 (1) Our outlook does not include provisions for proposed tax law changes, future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as certain investments, derivative and foreign currency transaction gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our financial outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain. Our outlook includes the impact of any pending business combinations to the extent they are expected to close in the upcoming quarter. Actual results may differ materially from the outlook. (2) Our guidance for diluted EPS attributable to other items for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from the requirement to capitalize research and development expenditures under U.S. Federal income tax law, partially offset by acquisition-related items.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding: our roadmap and product execution; our being well positioned across our businesses; our technology leadership, including in on-device generative AI and mobile computing performance; our business outlook; and our estimates and guidance related to revenues and earnings per share (EPS). Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as “estimates,” “guidance,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks” and similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to: our dependence on a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium-tier devices; our customers vertically integrating; a significant portion of our business being concentrated in China, which is exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions; our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets; our strategic acquisitions, transactions and investments, and our ability to consummate strategic acquisitions; our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers; risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities; security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; the continued and future success of our licensing programs, which requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring; efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property, and other attacks on our licensing business model; potential changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise; adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and our customers’ demand for our products based on these technologies; competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; failures in our products or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors; difficulties in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights; claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property; our use of open source software; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, declines in global, regional or local economic conditions, or our stock price and earnings volatility; geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises, and other factors outside of our control; our ability to comply with laws, regulations, policies and standards; our indebtedness; and potential tax liabilities.

2023 Results Page 8 of 10 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “Non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein. We use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We present Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations. Non-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items. • QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance. • Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. • Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows: ◦ Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information. Acquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. ◦ We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense). ◦ Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.

Other items excluded from Non-GAAP results also included $10 million of gains driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities, which decreased operating expenses, offset by corresponding $8 million of losses driven by the revaluation of the associated plan assets, which were included within investment and other income (expense), net, as well as $140 million of losses, net of income taxes, from the discontinued operations of the Non-Arriver businesses. (2) At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision (benefit) for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions (benefits) may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision (benefit) in the “Other Items” column. Tax benefit in the “Other Items” column included a $260 million benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deduction resulting from the requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures, a $133 million benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT, a $59 million net benefit from the release of a valuation allowance, a $19 million benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges, partially offset by a $33 million foreign currency loss related to a noncurrent receivable resulting from our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods and a $2 million charge to reconcile the tax provision of each column to the total GAAP tax provision for the quarter.

The “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our most recent annual report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides a more complete description of our risks. The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current outlook. Current Guidance Q1 FY24 Estimates 1 Revenues $9.1B - $9.9B Supplemental Revenue Information QCT revenues $7.7B - $8.3B QTL revenues $1.3B - $1.5B GAAP diluted EPS $1.82 - $2.02 Less diluted EPS attributable to QSI $— Less diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation ($0.45) Less diluted EPS attributable to other items 2 $0.02 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $2.25 - $2.45 (1) Our outlook does not include provisions for proposed tax law changes, future asset impairments or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as certain investments, derivative and foreign currency transaction gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our financial outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain. Our outlook includes the impact of any pending business combinations to the extent they are expected to close in the upcoming quarter. Actual results may differ materially from the outlook. (2) Our guidance for diluted EPS attributable to other items for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from the requirement to capitalize research and development expenditures under U.S. Federal income tax law, partially offset by acquisition-related items.

Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements In addition to the historical information contained herein, this news release contains forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding: our roadmap and product execution; our being well positioned across our businesses; our technology leadership, including in on-device generative AI and mobile computing performance; our business outlook; and our estimates and guidance related to revenues and earnings per share (EPS). Forward-looking statements are generally identified by words such as “estimates,” “guidance,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks” and similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to in the forward-looking statements due to a number of important factors, including but not limited to: our dependence on a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium-tier devices; our customers vertically integrating; a significant portion of our business being concentrated in China, which is exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions; our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets; our strategic acquisitions, transactions and investments, and our ability to consummate strategic acquisitions; our dependence on a limited number of third-party suppliers; risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities; security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information; our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; the continued and future success of our licensing programs, which requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring; efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property, and other attacks on our licensing business model; potential changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise; adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and our customers’ demand for our products based on these technologies; competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; failures in our products or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors; difficulties in enforcing and protecting our intellectual property rights; claims by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property; our use of open source software; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry, declines in global, regional or local economic conditions, or our stock price and earnings volatility; geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises, and other factors outside of our control; our ability to comply with laws, regulations, policies and standards; our indebtedness; and potential tax liabilities.

2023 Results Page 8 of 10 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “Non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein. We use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We present Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations. Non-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items. • QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance. • Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. • Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows: ◦ Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information. Acquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. ◦ We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense). ◦ Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.

(2) In the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, other items excluded from Non-GAAP revenues included a reduction to licensing revenues related to a portion of a business arrangement that resolves a legal dispute. (3) Non-GAAP reconciling items related to revenues consisted primarily of nonreportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Non-GAAP reconciling items related to EBT consisted primarily of certain cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other expenses or income, interest expense and certain investment income (expense) that are not allocated to segments for management reporting purposes; nonreportable segment results; and the elimination of intersegment profit.

Prior period information has been recast to reflect this change. Return of Capital to Stockholders During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we returned $1.3 billion to stockholders, including $893 million, or $0.80 per share, of cash dividends paid and $400 million through repurchases of 4 million shares of common stock. Business Outlook The following statements are forward looking, and actual results may differ materially. The “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this news release provides a description of certain risks that we face, and our most recent quarterly report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides a more complete description of our risks. The midpoint of our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 guidance includes the continued impact of the macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units and channel inventory drawdown. The following table summarizes GAAP and Non-GAAP guidance based on the current outlook. Current Guidance Q4 FY23 Estimates 1 Revenues $8.1B - $8.9B Supplemental Revenue Information QCT revenues $6.9B - $7.5B QTL revenues $1.15B - $1.35B GAAP diluted EPS $1.37 - $1.57 Less diluted EPS attributable to QSI $— Less diluted EPS attributable to share-based compensation ($0.45) Less diluted EPS attributable to other items 2 $0.02 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $1.80 - $2.00 (1) Our outlook does not include provisions for proposed tax law changes, future asset impairments, charges from additional restructuring actions or for pending legal matters, other than future legal amounts that are probable and estimable. Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as certain investments, derivative and foreign currency transaction gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our financial outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain. Our outlook includes the impact of any pending business combinations to the extent they are expected to close in the upcoming quarter. Actual results may differ materially from the outlook. (2) Our guidance for diluted EPS attributable to other items for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from the requirement to capitalize research and development (R&D) expenditures under U.S. Federal income tax law, partially offset by acquisition-related items and existing restructuring plan charges.

Quarter Fiscal 2023 Results Page 7 of 8 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “Non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein. We use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We present Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations. Non-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items. • QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance. • Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. • Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows: ◦ Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information. Acquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. ◦ We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense). ◦ Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.

(2) Non-GAAP reconciling items related to revenues consisted primarily of nonreportable segment revenues less intersegment eliminations. Non-GAAP reconciling items related to EBT consisted primarily of certain cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other expenses or income, interest expense and certain investment income (expense) that are not allocated to segments for management reporting purposes; nonreportable segment results; and the elimination of intersegment profit.

(2) At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision (benefit) for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions (benefits) may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision (benefit) in the “Other Items” column. Tax benefit in the “Other Items” column included a $126 million benefit from fiscal 2021 and 2022 foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deductions related to a change in sourcing of R&D expenditures, a $57 million benefit related to a foreign tax audit, a $35 million benefit from the FDII deduction resulting from the requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures, an $11 million benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges and a $7 million benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT, partially offset by an $11 million foreign currency loss related to a noncurrent receivable resulting from our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods, an $11 million charge related to prior periods and a $3 million charge to reconcile the tax provision of each column to the total GAAP tax provision for the quarter.

Further, due to their nature, certain income and expense items, such as certain investments, derivative and foreign currency transaction gains or losses, cannot be accurately forecast. Accordingly, we only include such items in our financial outlook to the extent they are reasonably certain. Our outlook includes the impact of any pending business combinations to the extent they are expected to close in the upcoming quarter. Actual results may differ materially from the outlook. (2) Our guidance for diluted EPS attributable to other items for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is primarily related to the tax benefit resulting from the requirement to capitalize research and development (R&D) expenditures under U.S. Federal income tax law, partially offset by acquisition-related items and existing restructuring plan charges.

Quarter Fiscal 2023 Results Page 7 of 8 Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “Non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our Non-GAAP financial measures might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures are presented herein. We use Non-GAAP financial information: (i) to evaluate, assess and benchmark our operating results on a consistent and comparable basis; (ii) to measure the performance and efficiency of our ongoing core operating businesses, including our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments; and (iii) to compare the performance and efficiency of these segments against competitors. Non-GAAP measurements used by us include revenues, cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, other income or expenses, operating income, interest expense, net investment and other income, income or earnings before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are able to assess what we believe is a meaningful and comparable set of financial performance measures by using Non-GAAP information. In addition, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors uses certain Non-GAAP financial measures in establishing portions of the performance-based incentive compensation programs for our executive officers. We present Non-GAAP financial information to provide greater transparency to investors with respect to our use of such information in financial and operational decision-making. This Non-GAAP financial information is also used by institutional investors and analysts in evaluating our business and assessing trends and future expectations. Non-GAAP information presented herein excludes our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items. • QSI is excluded because we generally expect to exit our strategic investments in the foreseeable future, and the effects of fluctuations in the value of such investments and realized gains or losses are viewed as unrelated to our operational performance. • Share-based compensation expense primarily relates to restricted stock units. We believe that excluding share-based compensation from Non-GAAP financial information allows us and investors to make additional comparisons of the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses over time and with respect to other companies. • Certain other items are excluded because we view such items as unrelated to the operating activities of our ongoing core businesses, as follows: ◦ Acquisition-related items include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, substantially all of which relate to the amortization of technology-based intangible assets that is recorded in cost of revenues and will recur in future periods until the related intangible assets have been fully amortized. We view acquisition-related intangible assets as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. Acquisition-related intangible assets contribute to revenue generation that has not been excluded from our Non-GAAP financial information. Acquisition-related items also include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value and the related tax effects of acquisition-related items, as well as any effects from restructuring the ownership of such acquired assets. We also exclude the operating results of acquired and/or consolidated businesses that, as of close, are expected or required to be sold. Additionally, we exclude certain other acquisition-related charges such as third-party acquisition and integration services costs and costs related to temporary debt facilities and letters of credit executed prior to the close of an acquisition. ◦ We exclude certain other items that we view as unrelated to our ongoing businesses, such as major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairments and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. We exclude gains and losses driven by the revaluation of our deferred compensation plan liabilities recognized in operating expenses and the offsetting gains and losses on the related plan assets recognized in investment and other income (expense). ◦ Certain tax items that are unrelated to the fiscal year in which they are recorded are excluded in order to provide a clearer understanding of our ongoing Non-GAAP tax rate and after-tax earnings. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and for the initial five-year period in which we are required to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we also exclude the favorable impact to our provision for income taxes and results of operations resulting from such change in treatment of R&D expenditures. The favorable tax provision impact will diminish in future years as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.

Non-GAAP reconciling items related to EBT consisted primarily of certain cost of revenues, R&D expenses, SG&A expenses, other expenses or income, interest expense and certain investment income (expense) that are not allocated to segments for management reporting purposes; nonreportable segment results; and the elimination of intersegment profit.

(2) At fiscal year end, the quarterly tax provision for each column equals the annual tax provision (benefit) for each column computed in accordance with GAAP. In interim quarters, the sum of these provisions (benefits) may not equal the total GAAP tax provision, and this difference is included in the tax provision (benefit) in the “Other Items” column. Tax benefit in the “Other Items” column included a $126 million benefit from fiscal 2021 and 2022 foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) deductions related to a change in sourcing of R&D expenditures, a $57 million benefit related to a foreign tax audit, a $35 million benefit from the FDII deduction resulting from the requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures, an $11 million benefit for the tax effect of acquisition-related charges and a $7 million benefit from the combined effect of other items in EBT, partially offset by an $11 million foreign currency loss related to a noncurrent receivable resulting from our refund claim of Korean withholding taxes paid in prior periods, an $11 million charge related to prior periods and a $3 million charge to reconcile the tax provision of each column to the total GAAP tax provision for the quarter.

The company turned the rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the U.S. and leveraged asset-light and proven cost management strategies in the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. “Our Transformation initiatives are generating greater efficiencies across the network and, when combined with our growth strategies, UPS achieved profit growth in all segments,” said David Abney, UPS chairman and CEO. “We also announced a very extensive roll-out of new products and services such as UPS My Choice for Business, expanded UPS Access Points, and UPS Worldwide Economy, among others, for small- and medium-sized businesses, all designed to generate additional profitable growth.” Amounts presented on an adjusted basis exclude Transformation strategy costs. Second-quarter 2019 adjusted results exclude a pre-tax charge of $21 million, or $0.02 per share after tax. Second-quarter 2018 adjusted results excluded a pre-tax charge of $263 million, or $0.23 per share after tax, primarily from the UPS Voluntary Retirement Program. Consolidated Results 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $18,048 M $17,456 M Net Income $1,685 M $1,702 M $1,485 M $1,685 M Diluted Earnings Per Share $1.94 $1.96 $1.71 $1.94 - more - * “ Adjusted” and “as adjusted” amounts presented in this release are non-GAAP financial measures. See the appendix to this release for a discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most closely correlated GAAP measure. For the total company in 2Q 2019: • Consolidated revenue increased 3.4% to $18 billion, driven by gains in average daily volume in the U.S. and higher-quality, currency-neutral revenue in the International segment. • Total operating profit grew nearly 21%, and 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments. • Total operating margin expanded 170 basis points; adjusted operating margin expanded 30 basis points. • Capital expenditures for the year are approximately $2.9 billion to support network enhancements. • Year-to-date dividends per share increased 5.5% and the company repurchased 4.8 million shares for approximately $500 million. U.S. Domestic Segment The U.S. Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume. The sharp increase in demand for the company’s next-day services was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. “Demand for faster delivery is a structural change in our industry,” said Abney. “Anticipating this change, our additional air capacity and modernized network enabled this growth to have a positive impact on profitability and positions UPS well to serve the growing needs of the market.” Both B2B and B2C shipments grew within the period. In addition, the company added more than 2 million square feet of new, automated sorting capabilities, increasing efficiency benefits and contributing to positive operating leverage. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $11,150 M $10,354 M Operating profit $1,208 M $1,226 M $939 M $1,135 M • Revenue increased $796 million or 7.7% over 2Q 2018, led by increased demand for air services from customers in healthcare and retail. • Operating profit increased by 28.6%, or 8% on an adjusted basis. • Operating margins were 10.8%, and 11% on an adjusted basis. • Network efficiencies continued to reduce the growth in cost per piece, with a steady decline in unit cost growth for the third straight quarter. - more - International Segment International benefitted from its highly flexible network and by targeting growth markets within the company’s diverse revenue base. The segment generated its best second-quarter profit in history and expanded adjusted operating margins while navigating areas of trade uncertainty. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $3,505 M $3,602 M Operating profit $663 M $665 M $618 M $654M • International volume slightly declined due to global macroeconomic pressure and tough year-over-year comparisons, as 2Q 2018 exports grew 9.5%. • Total revenue per piece fell less than 1%, but grew nearly 2% when adjusting for currency. • International domestic revenue per piece rose 0.3%, an increase of 5.6% on a currency-neutral basis. • Operating profit increased more than 7%, or by 1.7% on an adjusted basis. Supply Chain and Freight Segment Supply Chain and Freight grew operating profit to more than $270 million, a double-digit increase for the quarter. Successful cost management enabled by the company’s asset-light strategies delivered strong financial results while revenue was pressured by softer trade. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $3,393M $3,500 M Operating profit $272 M $273 M $216 M $247M • Operating margins expanded to 8% on an adjusted and unadjusted basis, due to strong execution, disciplined cost management and strategic initiatives that focus on delivering excellent service levels and growing high-quality revenue from the SMB market. • International Air Freight achieved robust profit growth on a decline in tonnage, driven by expanded buy/sell spreads. • Coyote and Marken made significant contributions to operating profit. • UPS Freight achieved a 3.9% increase in revenue per LTL (less-than-truckload) hundredweight as the unit focused on revenue quality. Outlook The company provides guidance on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis because it is not possible to predict or provide a reconciliation reflecting the impact of future pension mark-to-market adjustments or other unanticipated events, which would be included in reported (GAAP) results and could be material. - more - “UPS grew profits across all business segments,” said Richard Peretz, UPS’s chief financial officer. “Our performance was driven by the efficiencies created by investments in our network, the success of ongoing initiatives and our ability to execute in an ever-changing environment. We expect to carry this momentum through the upcoming quarters.” • The company’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $7.45 to $7.75. • Adjusted free cash flow for the year is projected to be between $3.5 and $4 billion with potential additional upside from the working capital initiatives. • The effective tax rate for the full-year 2019 is estimated to be between 22% and 24%. • Third-quarter adjusted EPS is expected to benefit from numerous items including one additional operating day and year-over-year International benefits from 2018 commodities headwinds that should not repeat. • Transformation charges and pension MTM are not included in the adjusted guidance. # # # Conference Call Information UPS CEO David Abney and CFO Richard Peretz will discuss second-quarter results with investors and analysts during a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET, July 24, 2019.

Forward-Looking Statements Except for historical information contained herein, the statements made in this release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of UPS and its management regarding the company's strategic direction, prospects and future results, involve certain risks and uncertainties. Certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including changes in economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, governmental regulations (including tax laws and regulations), our competitive environment, the facts or assumptions underlying our health and pension benefit funding obligations, the results of negotiation and ratification of labor contracts, the impact of any strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, changes in aviation and motor fuel prices, cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, and other risks discussed in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference. Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, as applicable, ""as adjusted"" operating profit, operating margin, other income (expense), pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share. Additionally, we periodically disclose free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions, and capital expenditures excluding principal repayments of capital lease obligations. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as ""reported"" or ""unadjusted.” We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include but are not limited to: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); settlement of contingencies; gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; charges related to restructuring programs such as the implementation of our Transformation strategy; asset impairments (non-cash); amounts related to changes in tax regulations or positions; amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any hedging activities; other pension and postretirement related items; and debt modifications. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results, cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions. We also use certain of these measures for the determination of incentive compensation awards. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Costs Related to Restructuring Programs; Transformation Strategy Costs We supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share with similar non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs. We believe this adjusted information provides a useful comparison of year-to-year financial performance without considering the short-term impact of restructuring costs. We evaluate our performance on this adjusted basis. Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities We supplement the reporting of our revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-GAAP measures that exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities. We believe currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results. We evaluate the performance of our International Package and Supply Chain and Freight segments on this currency-neutral basis. Currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Capital Expenditures We supplement the reporting of cash flows from operating activities with free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions and free cash flow plus principal repayments of capital lease obligations, non-GAAP liquidity measures. We believe these free cash flow measures are important indicators of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use them as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Additionally, we believe that adjusting capital expenditures for principal repayments of capital lease obligations more appropriately reflects the overall cash that we have invested in capital assets. We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. Free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions adds back any discretionary pension contributions made during the period.

The company turned the rising demand for next-day service into strong financial results in the U.S. and leveraged asset-light and proven cost management strategies in the International and Supply Chain and Freight segments. “Our Transformation initiatives are generating greater efficiencies across the network and, when combined with our growth strategies, UPS achieved profit growth in all segments,” said David Abney, UPS chairman and CEO. “We also announced a very extensive roll-out of new products and services such as UPS My Choice for Business, expanded UPS Access Points, and UPS Worldwide Economy, among others, for small- and medium-sized businesses, all designed to generate additional profitable growth.” Amounts presented on an adjusted basis exclude Transformation strategy costs. Second-quarter 2019 adjusted results exclude a pre-tax charge of $21 million, or $0.02 per share after tax. Second-quarter 2018 adjusted results excluded a pre-tax charge of $263 million, or $0.23 per share after tax, primarily from the UPS Voluntary Retirement Program. Consolidated Results 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $18,048 M $17,456 M Net Income $1,685 M $1,702 M $1,485 M $1,685 M Diluted Earnings Per Share $1.94 $1.96 $1.71 $1.94 - more - * “ Adjusted” and “as adjusted” amounts presented in this release are non-GAAP financial measures. See the appendix to this release for a discussion of non-GAAP financial metrics, including a reconciliation to the most closely correlated GAAP measure. For the total company in 2Q 2019: • Consolidated revenue increased 3.4% to $18 billion, driven by gains in average daily volume in the U.S. and higher-quality, currency-neutral revenue in the International segment. • Total operating profit grew nearly 21%, and 6.3% on an adjusted basis, with growth in all segments. • Total operating margin expanded 170 basis points; adjusted operating margin expanded 30 basis points. • Capital expenditures for the year are approximately $2.9 billion to support network enhancements. • Year-to-date dividends per share increased 5.5% and the company repurchased 4.8 million shares for approximately $500 million. U.S. Domestic Segment The U.S. Domestic segment generated significant volume growth in all products, led by a more than 30% surge in UPS Next Day Air volume. The sharp increase in demand for the company’s next-day services was driven by accelerated delivery requirements from e-commerce shippers. “Demand for faster delivery is a structural change in our industry,” said Abney. “Anticipating this change, our additional air capacity and modernized network enabled this growth to have a positive impact on profitability and positions UPS well to serve the growing needs of the market.” Both B2B and B2C shipments grew within the period. In addition, the company added more than 2 million square feet of new, automated sorting capabilities, increasing efficiency benefits and contributing to positive operating leverage. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $11,150 M $10,354 M Operating profit $1,208 M $1,226 M $939 M $1,135 M • Revenue increased $796 million or 7.7% over 2Q 2018, led by increased demand for air services from customers in healthcare and retail. • Operating profit increased by 28.6%, or 8% on an adjusted basis. • Operating margins were 10.8%, and 11% on an adjusted basis. • Network efficiencies continued to reduce the growth in cost per piece, with a steady decline in unit cost growth for the third straight quarter. - more - International Segment International benefitted from its highly flexible network and by targeting growth markets within the company’s diverse revenue base. The segment generated its best second-quarter profit in history and expanded adjusted operating margins while navigating areas of trade uncertainty. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $3,505 M $3,602 M Operating profit $663 M $665 M $618 M $654M • International volume slightly declined due to global macroeconomic pressure and tough year-over-year comparisons, as 2Q 2018 exports grew 9.5%. • Total revenue per piece fell less than 1%, but grew nearly 2% when adjusting for currency. • International domestic revenue per piece rose 0.3%, an increase of 5.6% on a currency-neutral basis. • Operating profit increased more than 7%, or by 1.7% on an adjusted basis. Supply Chain and Freight Segment Supply Chain and Freight grew operating profit to more than $270 million, a double-digit increase for the quarter. Successful cost management enabled by the company’s asset-light strategies delivered strong financial results while revenue was pressured by softer trade. 2Q 2019 Adjusted 2Q 2019 2Q 2018 Adjusted 2Q 2018 Revenue $3,393M $3,500 M Operating profit $272 M $273 M $216 M $247M • Operating margins expanded to 8% on an adjusted and unadjusted basis, due to strong execution, disciplined cost management and strategic initiatives that focus on delivering excellent service levels and growing high-quality revenue from the SMB market. • International Air Freight achieved robust profit growth on a decline in tonnage, driven by expanded buy/sell spreads. • Coyote and Marken made significant contributions to operating profit. • UPS Freight achieved a 3.9% increase in revenue per LTL (less-than-truckload) hundredweight as the unit focused on revenue quality. Outlook The company provides guidance on an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis because it is not possible to predict or provide a reconciliation reflecting the impact of future pension mark-to-market adjustments or other unanticipated events, which would be included in reported (GAAP) results and could be material. - more - “UPS grew profits across all business segments,” said Richard Peretz, UPS’s chief financial officer. “Our performance was driven by the efficiencies created by investments in our network, the success of ongoing initiatives and our ability to execute in an ever-changing environment. We expect to carry this momentum through the upcoming quarters.” • The company’s full-year adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $7.45 to $7.75. • Adjusted free cash flow for the year is projected to be between $3.5 and $4 billion with potential additional upside from the working capital initiatives. • The effective tax rate for the full-year 2019 is estimated to be between 22% and 24%. • Third-quarter adjusted EPS is expected to benefit from numerous items including one additional operating day and year-over-year International benefits from 2018 commodities headwinds that should not repeat. • Transformation charges and pension MTM are not included in the adjusted guidance. # # # Conference Call Information UPS CEO David Abney and CFO Richard Peretz will discuss second-quarter results with investors and analysts during a conference call at 8:30 a.m. ET, July 24, 2019.

Certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including changes in economic and other conditions in the markets in which we operate, governmental regulations (including tax laws and regulations), our competitive environment, the facts or assumptions underlying our health and pension benefit funding obligations, the results of negotiation and ratification of labor contracts, the impact of any strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns, changes in aviation and motor fuel prices, cyclical and seasonal fluctuations in our operating results, and other risks discussed in the company's Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which discussions are incorporated herein by reference. Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP Financial Measures We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, as applicable, ""as adjusted"" operating profit, operating margin, other income (expense), pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share. Additionally, we periodically disclose free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions, and capital expenditures excluding principal repayments of capital lease obligations. The equivalent measures determined in accordance with GAAP are also referred to as ""reported"" or ""unadjusted.” We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include but are not limited to: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); settlement of contingencies; gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; charges related to restructuring programs such as the implementation of our Transformation strategy; asset impairments (non-cash); amounts related to changes in tax regulations or positions; amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of any hedging activities; other pension and postretirement related items; and debt modifications. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in understanding our financial results, cash flows and assessing our ongoing performance because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions. We also use certain of these measures for the determination of incentive compensation awards. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial information does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Costs Related to Restructuring Programs; Transformation Strategy Costs We supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, pre-tax income, net income and earnings per share with similar non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of costs related to restructuring programs, including Transformation strategy costs. We believe this adjusted information provides a useful comparison of year-to-year financial performance without considering the short-term impact of restructuring costs. We evaluate our performance on this adjusted basis. Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities We supplement the reporting of our revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with non-GAAP measures that exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities. We believe currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results. We evaluate the performance of our International Package and Supply Chain and Freight segments on this currency-neutral basis. Currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Capital Expenditures We supplement the reporting of cash flows from operating activities with free cash flow, free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions and free cash flow plus principal repayments of capital lease obligations, non-GAAP liquidity measures. We believe these free cash flow measures are important indicators of how much cash is generated by regular business operations and we use them as a measure of incremental cash available to invest in our business, meet our debt obligations and return cash to shareowners. Additionally, we believe that adjusting capital expenditures for principal repayments of capital lease obligations more appropriately reflects the overall cash that we have invested in capital assets. We calculate free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, and plus or minus the net changes in finance receivables and other investing activities. Free cash flow excluding discretionary pension contributions adds back any discretionary pension contributions made during the period.
