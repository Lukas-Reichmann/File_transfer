BU SINESS Our Company We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. We believe that this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. Our technology leadership, our current intellectual property position, and our more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable us to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. Our primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize our proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. We have established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through our internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. We currently own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. We manufacture and sell our proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. We also enter into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which we grant them licenses to practice under our patents and to use our proprietary know-how. At the same time, we work with these and other companies that are evaluating our OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Market Overview The Display Panel Market Thin, energy-efficient display panels that can be manufactured on glass or flexible substrates are essential for a wide variety of portable consumer electronics products, such as mobile phones, AR/VR headsets, digital cameras, wearables, tablets and notebook computers. Due to their narrow profile and light weight, flat panel displays are the display of choice for larger product applications, such as computer monitors and televisions. Liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, continue to dominate the flat panel display market. However, we believe that OLED displays are an attractive alternative to LCDs, and OLED displays are gaining market share, because they offer a number of potential advantages, including: Based on these characteristics, product manufacturers have adopted small-area OLED displays for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables and tablets. Manufacturers are increasingly commercializing large-area OLED displays for use in televisions and monitors. We believe that if these efforts are successful, they could result in sizeable markets for OLED displays. 2 Organic materials make technically possible the development of flexible displays for use in an entirely new array of product applications. Such applications include display devices that fold in use, or conform to various shapes for wearable, rollable, industrial and ruggedized applications. In addition, due to the inherent transparency of the organic materials and transparent electrode technologies, OLEDs eventually may enable the production of transparent displays for use in products such as automotive windshields and windows with embedded displays. The Solid-State Lighting Market Traditional incandescent light bulbs are inefficient because they convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into visible light, with the rest emerging as heat. Fluorescent lamps use excited gases, or plasmas, to achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of about 20%. However, the color rendering index of most fluorescent lamps – in other words, the quality of their color compared to an ideal light source – is inferior to that of an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent lamps also pose environmental concerns because they typically contain mercury. Solid-state lighting relies on the direct conversion of electricity to visible light using semiconductor materials. By avoiding the heat and plasma-producing processes of incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, respectively, solid-state lighting products can have substantially higher energy conversion efficiencies. There are currently two basic types of solid-state lighting devices: inorganic light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and OLEDs. Current LEDs are very small in size (about one square millimeter) and are extremely bright. Having been developed about 25 years before OLEDs, LEDs are already widely employed in a variety of lighting products, such as traffic lights, digital signage and billboards, replacements for incandescent lighting, backlights for smartphones, computer monitors and televisions, and as border or accent lighting. However, most commercial LED offerings are characterized by high operating temperatures and intense brightness which may make them less desirable for many lighting applications. OLEDs, on the other hand, can be designed to provide improved lighting characteristics because they can be larger in size and can be viewed directly, without using diffusers that are required to temper the intense brightness of LEDs. OLEDs can be fabricated onto any suitable surface, including glass, plastic or metal foil, and could be cost-effective to manufacture in high volume. Given these characteristics, product manufacturers are working on and have introduced limited product applications of OLEDs for diffuse specialty lighting applications and ultimately general illumination. If these efforts are successful, we believe that OLED lighting products could begin to be used for applications currently addressed by other existing lighting technologies, as well as for new applications that take advantage of the OLED form factor. In particular, the ability of OLED technology to produce uniform illumination over arbitrary shapes is making OLED lighting very attractive to the automobile industry as well as the digital signage industry. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we currently are one of the leading technology developers in the OLED industry because we were the first company to develop and commercialize PHOLED emitter technology. Our experienced management and research teams have built an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our OLED technologies and materials, particularly with regard to PHOLED emitter materials, which we continually seek to enhance and grow. We work diligently, through the delivery of high-quality commercial products, superior technical support and customer service, to enable our industry-leading customers, which primarily are large display manufacturers, to adopt our OLED technologies and materials through implementation of long-term commercial material supply and patent and know-how license agreements. Our key competitive strengths include: Technology Leadership We are a recognized technology leader in the OLED industry. We, along with world-class academic partners, pioneered the development of our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technologies, which can be used to produce OLEDs that are up to four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs, which are illuminated using backlights. We believe that our PHOLED technologies and materials will continue to be well-suited for industry usage in the commercial production of OLED displays and lighting products. Through our internal, innovative research, which has produced the majority of our most critical commercial technologies, our relationships with supplier companies, such as PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and our existing and new academic partners, we believe that we can continue to advance the technology we have already developed and commercialized, and that we will continue to discover and develop other important OLED technologies, as well as novel OLED materials, that will facilitate further adoption of our various OLED technologies by product manufacturers. To this end, we operate two state-of-the-art laboratories, or Application Centers, near our larger customers in the Asia-Pacific region. These Application Centers have provided us and our customers with the ability to more quickly evaluate, develop and bring to market our newest OLED materials and technologies. We also are committing significant resources to 3 further the development of next-generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as organic vapor jet printing (OVJP). Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property Generally, each of our commercial offerings is protected by multiple patents which can help us either to prevent or combat the introduction of counterfeit and/or knock-off products that could potentially impact the market demand for our OLED materials and technologies. Our strong patent and non-patented know-how portfolios in the areas of PHOLED emitter materials, complementary PHOLED materials, OLED device designs, and OLED manufacturing technologies are reflective of our continued commitment to innovate and invest. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the OLED industry. Through our internal development efforts, acquisitions, and long-standing relationships with academic partners, research institutions and product manufacturers, we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. We continue to enhance and grow our OLED technology and materials patent portfolio organically through internal research and development, partnering with third parties, and by acquisition. We also continue to accumulate valuable non-patented technical know-how relating to our OLED technologies and materials. Leading Supplier of UniversalPHOLED® Emitter Materials and Related Technology Licensing We are the leading supplier of PHOLED emitter materials to OLED device manufacturers. The emitter material, which is designed to efficiently convert electrical energy to a desired wavelength of light, is the key component in an OLED device. Our manufacturing partner of over 20 years, PPG, continues to manufacture our materials for us, using proprietary manufacturing processes and know-how, which materials we then qualify to our exacting product specifications and resell on a just-in-time basis to OLED device manufacturers. We record revenues based on our sales of these materials to OLED device manufacturers. Our commercial supply agreements typically require our customers to purchase minimum quantities of our materials, which purchases can be in the form of annual minimum purchase undertakings or as a minimum percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. Our commercial supply arrangements allow us to maintain close technical and business relationships with these OLED device manufacturers purchasing our proprietary materials, and thereby further supports our technology licensing business. We do not directly manufacture or sell OLED display or lighting products. Instead, we enter into non-exclusive licensing arrangements with OLED device manufacturers, many of which also purchase our materials, that pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties based on their sales of licensed commercial products using our proprietary technology and patents. We believe this business model allows us to concentrate on our core strengths of technology development and innovation, while at the same time provides significant operating leverage. We also believe that this approach may reduce potential competitive conflicts with our customers. Long-Standing Customer Relationships We have long-standing customer relationships with OLED device manufacturers that are using, or are evaluating for use, our OLED materials in commercial OLED products. We have more than 20 years of experience in working closely with OLED device manufacturers and have provided support to them in their commercialization of OLED technology by delivering customer-specific solutions for red, green, and yellow emitter materials, or dopants. We have a proven track record of delivering consistent, high-quality OLED material to our customers. We provide just-in-time supply to our customers and serve as a sole source to them for many of our critical materials. We believe that our unparalleled manufacturing partners, namely PPG, our well-established supply chain, our multi-tier quality testing, and our product assurance protocols make us a preferred partner for our customers and for any large-scale OLED display manufacturer that wants to deliver to high-quality international end-customers. In 2022, our largest customers for our PHOLED materials included Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE), Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma), Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox), Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT), Shenzhen Royale Display Technologies Co. Ltd., Japan Display, Inc., Sharp Corporation, and AU Optronics Corporation (AU Optronics). Other licensed customers of our technology in 2022 included Kaneka Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and OLEDWorks L.L.C. Complementary UniversalPHOLED ® Host Material Business In addition to our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® emitter materials, we continue to develop, supply and offer for sale certain of our proprietary phosphorescent host materials to OLED device manufacturers. In addition, we have entered into a number of host 4 material strategic partnerships through development agreements with OLED material partners that are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in order to optimize the performance of our emitters in our customers’ newest product designs. We do not believe that revenue from our host development and third-party collaboration agreements will be significant compared with our emitter business. However, we believe that development and collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring the continued success of the OLED industry and the broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies in the marketplace. Experienced Management and Scientific Advisory Team Our management team has significant experience in developing business models focused on licensing disruptive technologies in high growth industries. The team has strong relationships with, and deep understandings of, our customers and their needs, the commercial marketplace and the OLED industry on the whole. We believe our management team’s experience and long-standing relationships are important to maintaining good and accommodating working relationships with our customers, particularly when we are confronted with challenging technical, regulatory and trade issues given our international reach. In addition, we employ and contract with some of the leading researchers in the industry, and we maintain a long-standing Scientific Advisory Board that includes industry pioneers, namely Professor Stephen R. Forrest of the University of Michigan (Michigan) and Professor Mark E. Thompson of the University of Southern California (USC). Our Business Strategy Our current business strategy is to continue to promote and expand our portfolio of OLED technologies and materials for widespread use in OLED displays and lighting products. We generate revenues primarily by selling our proprietary OLED materials and licensing our OLED technologies to display and lighting product manufacturers. We are presently focused on the following steps to implement our business strategy: Expand Our Collaborative Relationships with Leading Product Manufacturers and Developers We collaborate and partner with leading manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are commercial licensees of our OLED technologies and purchasers of our OLED materials. We also supply our proprietary OLED materials to manufacturers and developers of OLED displays and lighting products for evaluation and for use in product development and for pre-commercial activities, and we provide technical assistance and support to these manufacturers and developers to foster ongoing relationships and new commercial agreements. We concentrate on working closely with OLED device manufacturers and developers because we believe that the successful incorporation of our technologies and materials into commercial products is critical to their widespread adoption. Enhance Our Existing Portfolio of PHOLED Technologies and Materials We believe that a strong portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products is critical to our continued success, particularly as the utilization of PHOLED technologies and materials expands in the marketplace. Consequently, we are continually seeking to expand this portfolio through our internal development efforts, our collaborative relationships with existing and new academic and other research partners, and other strategic opportunities, such as funding early-stage startup companies whose technology may be synergistic to ours. Since the acquisition of the early fundamental research developed by our initial academic partners in the late 1990’s, one of our primary goals has been and continues to be the development of new and improved PHOLED technologies and materials with increased efficiencies, enhanced color gamut and extended lifetimes, which are compatible with different manufacturing methods, so that they can be used by various manufacturers in a broad array of OLED display and lighting products. Develop Next-Generation Organic Technologies We continue to conduct research and development activities relating to next-generation OLED technologies for both displays and lighting products, including next generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as OVJP, which we discuss in more detail below. We also are funding research by existing and new academic partners and research institutions on the use of OLED related technologies in other applications. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to enable us to maintain our position as a leading provider of OLED and other organic electronics technologies and materials as new markets emerge. 5 Business and Geographic Markets We derive revenue from the following: Most manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are or might potentially be interested in our OLED technologies and materials are currently located outside of the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide on-the-ground support to these manufacturers, we have established wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong, as well as a representative office in Taiwan. In 2019, we also completed the construction of new Application Centers in Hong Kong and Pangyo, South Korea, which allow our Asia-based display manufacturers to evaluate our technology more quickly and incorporate the technology into their commercial designs. Our wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, UDC Ireland Ltd. (UDC Ireland), is responsible for all material sales worldwide (excluding the United States) and for licensing and managing intellectual property and undertaking certain other business transactions in all non-U.S. territories. In 2022, we received a majority of our revenue from three customers domiciled in the Asia-Pacific region, BOE, LG Display and SDC, from each of which we had revenue in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenue. Our business is heavily dependent on our relationships with these customers. Substantially all revenue derived from our customers is denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally enter into long-term agreements with our customers, which may include (1) a commercial supply agreement for the purchase of specific OLED materials, and (2) patent and know-how license agreements that relate to the manufacture of display and lighting devices. Generally, our commercial material supply agreements provide for multi-year purchase commitments, typically on a price per gram basis, which entitle our customers to certain discounts, technical support on the use of our OLED materials in mass production facilities, and access to certain future OLED materials. In order to secure preferential pricing and technology access, a customer typically agrees to certain minimum purchase obligations which can be in the form of annual minimum purchase undertakings or a percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. If a customer does not meet its minimum purchase obligations, generally we would have the right to review pricing for future material sales and impose other financial penalties. Our patent and know-how license agreements generally are made available to our customers for the manufacture of OLED devices. In addition, we also may license to certain material company partners the right to manufacture certain OLED materials that are complementary to our phosphorescent emitter materials. These licenses have included licenses to make host products and certain other non-phosphorescent materials. We believe it is in our, and our customers’ best interests to facilitate the development of materials that are complementary to our offerings and which assist our customers to produce more efficient and manufacturable devices with our materials. These collaboration efforts are likely to generate additional licensing fees for us under our license agreements. Although our customers generally pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties for OLED licensed products that they manufacture, our material partner licensees generally pay us a portion of their sales for materials that are developed under material collaboration agreements and subsequently commercialized. To date, these material collaboration arrangements have not generated significant revenues for us. For more information on our revenues, costs and expenses associated with our business, as well as a breakdown of revenues from North America and foreign sources, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included elsewhere in this report. Our Technology and its Relation to OLED Technology and Structure OLED devices are solid-state semiconductor devices made from thin films of organic material that emit light of various wavelengths when electricity is selectively applied to the emissive layer of the device. OLED devices are typically referred to as incorporating an “OLED stack.” OLED stacks vary in specific structure but those commonly used today may include a cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, an emissive layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer and an anode, all of which are placed on a substrate which may be made of a number of different materials, including glass, plastic and metal. Our technology and materials are most commonly utilized in the emissive layer; the materials in the emissive layer are the light-generating component of the OLED stack. Many of our key technologies relate primarily to phosphorescent emitter materials, which we believe are more energy efficient than fluorescent emitter materials that can also be used to generate light within the emissive layer of 6 the OLED device. We began selling emitter materials commercially in 2003. A manufacturer will use a small amount of emitter material for each device through a process called “doping” into a host material. The emitter material(s) and the host material(s) together form an emissive layer system. Depending on the nature of the OLED device, the emissive materials and emissive layer system may be designed to emit different colors. We have commercially produced and sold phosphorescent emitter materials that produce red, yellow, green and light-blue light, which are combined in various ways for the display and lighting markets. Our current materials business, conducted outside the United States by UDC Ireland, is focused primarily on the delivery of such emissive materials. We have also developed host materials for the emissive layer and began selling them commercially in 2011. In addition to our materials, which are generally protected by patents covering various molecular structures, we also have system and process patents that cover various fundamentally important aspects of the OLED device, device architectures, use of materials in devices and OLED manufacturing processes. These patents are important to our licensing business because they enable us to provide our business partners important OLED related technologies. Our PHOLED Technologies PHOLED technologies utilize specialized materials and device structures that allow OLEDs to emit light through a process known as phosphorescence. Traditional fluorescent OLEDs emit light through an inherently less efficient process. Theory and experiment show that PHOLEDs exhibit device efficiencies up to four times higher than those exhibited by fluorescent OLEDs. Phosphorescence substantially reduces the power requirements of an OLED and is useful in displays for hand-held devices, such as smartphones, where battery power is often a limiting factor. Phosphorescence is also important for large-area displays such as televisions, where higher device efficiency and lower heat generation may enable longer product lifetimes and increased energy efficiency. We have a strong intellectual property portfolio surrounding our existing PHOLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products which we market under the UniversalPHOLED® brand. We devote a substantial portion of our efforts to developing new and improved proprietary PHOLED materials and device architectures for red, green, yellow, blue and white OLED devices. In 2022, we continued our commercial supply relationships with companies such as BOE, LG Display, SDC, Tianma, CSOT and Visionox to use our PHOLED materials to manufacture OLED displays. In addition, we have worked and continue to work closely with customers evaluating and qualifying our proprietary PHOLED materials for commercial usage in both displays and lighting products, and with other material suppliers to combine our PHOLED emitters with their phosphorescent hosts and other OLED materials. Our Additional Proprietary OLED Technologies Our intellectual property, research, development and commercialization efforts also encompass a number of other OLED device and manufacturing technologies, including, but not limited to, the following: FOLED  Flexible OLEDs We are working on a number of technologies required for the fabrication of OLEDs on flexible substrates. Most other flat panel displays are built on rigid glass substrates. In contrast, FOLEDs are OLEDs built on non-rigid substrates such as plastic or metal foil. This has the potential to enhance durability and enable conformation to certain shapes or repeated bending or flexing. Many OLED smartphone displays are built on plastic substrates including those produced by SDC and LG Display. Several of our customers demonstrated different foldable and rollable FOLED displays at recent Consumer Electronics Shows in Las Vegas, NV. The commercial introduction of such FOLED product offerings demonstrates the viability of new display product applications, such as portable, roll-up communications televisions, tablets, notebook computers and smartphones, as well as enhances the usefulness of such devices in ruggedized, industrial and wearable computing systems. Manufacturers also may be able to produce FOLEDs using more efficient continuous, or roll-to-roll, processing methods in the future. Our internal research and development efforts are expected to enhance and promote the future adoption of consumer and industrial FOLED devices. OVJP® Organic Vapor Jet Printing OLEDs could be manufactured using other processes as well, including OVJP. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask ( i.e. , the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. In 2019, we installed a red-green-blue OVJP pilot tool at our Ewing, New Jersey facility, and we continue to collaborate on OVJP technology development with Professor Forrest of Michigan. In June 2020, we formed a 7 wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary OVJP technology. As of December 31, 2022, OVJP Corp employed a team of 22 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. Our Strategic Relationships with Product Manufacturers We have established early-stage evaluation programs, development and pre-commercial programs, and commercial arrangements with a substantial number of manufacturers or potential manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products. Many of these relationships are directed towards tailoring our proprietary OLED technologies and materials for use by individual manufacturers. Our ultimate objective is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to these manufacturers for their commercial production of OLED products. Relationships with OLED Display Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to display manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. We have been collaborating with some of these display manufacturers for over 20 years. We have been working with SDC and providing our PHOLED materials to SDC for evaluation since 2001. Under the terms of a patent license agreement, we license our patents and technologies to SDC for its manufacture and sale of AMOLED (active-matrix organic light-emitting diode) display products. Under the terms of a supplemental purchase agreement, we supply our proprietary PHOLED materials to SDC for its use in manufacturing licensed products. We also continue to supply SDC with our proprietary UniversalPHOLED materials for use in its development efforts under a 2001 joint development agreement. Prior to the expiration of the then-current 2018 license and purchase agreements with SDC on December 31, 2022, we entered into, on December 2, 2022, new patent license and supplemental purchase agreements, both with an effective date of January 1, 2023. These agreements, which cover the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, last through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under these agreements, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years. These agreements convey to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. The supplemental purchase agreement provides for minimum annual purchase obligations of red and green phosphorescent emitter material from us for use in the manufacture of licensed products. The minimum commitment is subject to SDC's requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. SDC is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for smartphones and other personal electronic devices and produces displays for a number of different smartphone and electronic device manufacturers. We have been working with LG Display and its affiliates for over 15 years. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. LG Display is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for large-area televisions and produces display panels for a number of different television manufacturers. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma. Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE. Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. 8 In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox. Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with CSOT. In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. We have been collaborating with AU Optronics since 2001, and we continue to provide our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics under a 2016 commercial supply agreement through which AU Optronics also has certain license rights. We also continue to support numerous display manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, through evaluation arrangements in which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for limited scale commercial production, evaluation and for purposes of development, manufacturing qualification and product testing. Many of these strategic relationships have been in place for longer than a decade, and we continue to establish new relationships. Relationships with OLED Lighting Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to lighting manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. Many of these strategic relationships have also been in place for longer than a decade. Since 2004, we have been supporting Konica Minolta in its efforts to develop OLED lighting products. We continue to license our patents and technology to Konica Minolta under a 2008 OLED technology license agreement for its manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products that utilize our phosphorescent and other OLED technologies. We also continue to provide Konica Minolta with our proprietary PHOLED materials for its manufacture of commercial OLED lighting products under a 2011 commercial material supply agreement, and for evaluation purposes under a 2012 evaluation agreement. We also continue to license our OLED patents to Sumitomo under a 2015 OLED patent portfolio license agreement in which we granted Sumitomo a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing license to make and sell OLED lighting panels using a solution-based manufacturing process. Under the license agreement, Sumitomo may also purchase certain of our phosphorescent materials. We continue to license our OLED patents, and to provide our OLED materials, to OLEDWorks for use in OLED lighting products under patent license and commercial supply agreements signed in 2015. We have also extended the rights under these agreements to OLEDWorks GmbH, the German company and facility that OLEDWorks acquired in 2015 from Philips Technologie GmbH. We continue to license our technologies and patents to Kaneka for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products, under the terms of a 2013 license agreement, and we continue to supply our materials to Kaneka under a 2014 commercial material supply agreement. We also have a license agreement for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products with Pioneer, among others. Similar to our arrangements with display manufacturers, we continue to support numerous lighting manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, typically through evaluation agreements under which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for evaluation and potential commercial application. Relationships with Manufacturers for Other Commercial Products In addition to our relationships with lighting and display manufacturers, we have agreements and arrangements with manufacturers or potential manufacturers to use our proprietary OLED technologies and materials in other commercial products, such as in automotive interiors and exteriors. Our OLED Materials Manufacturing Business We supply our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® materials to display manufacturers, lighting manufacturers and others. These materials are produced in batch quantities by PPG to our exacting product specifications using our manufacturing process and 9 know-how. We qualify each batch of emitters at our device qualification facilities to ensure that they meet required specifications, and we store qualified product inventory for delivery to our customers. We believe that our inventory-carrying practices, along with the terms under which we sell our OLED materials (including payment terms), are typical for the markets in which we operate. In 2022, we completed successful Surveillance Audits on our ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems, our ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems, and our ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. In addition, the scope of our ISO 9001:2015 certification was expanded to include OLED fulfillment operations at our Shannon, Ireland and Pangyo, South Korea locations. PPG We have maintained a close working relationship with PPG since 2000. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with PPG, the term of which, by amendment in February 2021, continues through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Under that agreement, PPG is responsible, under our direction, for manufacturing scale-up of our proprietary OLED materials, and for supplying us with those materials. We use these materials for our own research and development as well as for resale to our customers, both for their evaluation and for use in commercial OLED products. Through our collaboration with PPG, key raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis. We have not had any issues with obtaining access to adequate amounts of any key raw materials. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the PPG agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland at our new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM), for the production of OLED materials. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. As with our initial agreement with PPG, under our 2021 amendment we will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. Collaborations with Other OLED Material Manufacturers We continued our non-exclusive collaborative relationships with OLED material manufacturing customers during 2022. Most of these relationships are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in an effort to optimize our PHOLED emitter products and deliver a high-performance system to the end customer. Our product manufacturing customers are not required to purchase host materials from us. As a result, we do not believe these collaboration efforts will generate significant revenue for us as compared to our emitter and licensing businesses. We believe, however, that collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring success of the OLED industry and broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies. Research and Development Our research and development activities are focused on the advancement of our OLED technologies and materials for displays, lighting and other applications. We conduct this research and development primarily internally and also through various relationships with commercial business partners, academic partners, and research institutions. Our venture capital company, UDC Ventures LLC, continues to seek to invest in companies that we believe are developing synergistic or complementary technologies to ours. Internal Development Efforts Ewing, New Jersey Facility We conduct a substantial portion of our OLED development activities at our state-of-the-art development and testing facility in Ewing, New Jersey. At this expanded facility, which now exceeds 50,000 square feet, we perform technology development, including device and process optimization, prototype fabrication, manufacturing scale-up studies, process and product testing, characterization and reliability studies, and technology transfer with our business partners. Our Ewing facility houses multiple OLED deposition systems, including a full-color flexible OLED system and an OVJP system. In addition, the facility contains equipment for substrate patterning, organic material deposition, display packaging, module assembly and extensive testing in Class 100 and 100,000 clean rooms and opto-electronic test laboratories. Our facility also includes state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical chemistry laboratories in which we conduct OLED materials research and make small quantities of new materials that we then test in OLED devices. 10 Application Centers In addition to our laboratory facilities in Ewing, New Jersey, in 2019 we completed the construction of new, leased, Application Centers in Hong Kong and Pangyo, South Korea. These centers, which include state-of-the-art OLED laboratories, better assist our Asia-based customers in their timely evaluation and adoption of our proprietary PHOLED materials, know-how and technologies in their respective PHOLED designs. Our Contract Research Organization Business: Adesis, Inc. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. Adesis currently operates in its headquarters facility, which it purchased in 2017 and consists of over 47,500 square feet in New Castle, Delaware, and in another, leased, over 40,000 square foot facility in Wilmington, Delaware. As of December 31, 2022, Adesis employed a team of 150 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Although we expect to continue to utilize the majority of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, Adesis is expected to continue operating as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries. University-Sponsored Research Original Academic Partners We have long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and USC for the conduct of research relating to our OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials for applications such as displays and lighting. This research, subject to an agreement entered into by the parties (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), generated many of the original fundamental PHOLED concepts and underlying patents that we commercialized, and had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Thompson. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan, where we continue to fund his research. Since 2006, in connection with Dr. Forrest’s transfer, we entered into a new sponsored research agreement with USC under which we are funding organic electronics research being conducted by Drs. Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years. We make payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2022, we were obligated to pay USC up to $2.0 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. Other Academic Relationships We entered into a contract research agreement with the Chitose Institute of Science and Technology of Japan (CIST) in 2004. Under that agreement, we funded a research program headed by Professor Chihaya Adachi relating to high-efficiency OLED materials and devices. We were granted exclusive rights to all intellectual property developed under this program. Our relationship with CIST ended in 2006 when Professor Adachi transferred to Kyushu University. However, we have continued our relationship with Professor Adachi under a separate consulting arrangement. In 2006 and 2007, we entered into one-year research agreements with Kyung Hee University to sponsor research programs on flexible, amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology. The programs were directed by Professor Jin Jang. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into contract research agreements with Silicon Display Technology, Ltd. (SDT), a company founded by Professor Jang, and in 2013, we entered into another one-year agreement with SDT. We continue to maintain a good working relationship with Professor Jang. Over the years, we have also entered into research agreements with various universities and research institutions that have been able to provide tailored research capabilities and insights relating to our PHOLED technology. As the utilization of PHOLED technology continues to expand, we intend to further engage key researchers at other universities and research institutions to help identify additional fundamental technologies that could benefit PHOLED technology implementation. Intellectual Property 11 Along with our personnel, our primary and most fundamental assets are patents and other intellectual property. This includes more than 5,500 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense. It also includes a substantial body of non-patented technical know-how that we have accumulated over time. Our Patents Our research and development activities, conducted both internally and through collaborative programs with third parties, have resulted in our filing of a substantial number of patent applications relating to our OLED technologies and materials. These patents that we own represent, among other things, innovations beyond the original fundamental PHOLED conceptual patents that we license from our university research partners, described below. Although many of these licensed fundamental conceptual patents have expired, our internal research efforts include essential innovations that have generated commercially viable implementations of the original PHOLED concepts and patents. As of December 31, 2022, we owned more than 5,000 unexpired issued patents and pending patent applications around the world in addition to the hundreds of patents and patent applications we exclusively license from our research partners, as discussed below. Patents We License from Research Partners We exclusively license patent rights from a number of university research partners. Generally, we sponsor scientific researchers at universities to undertake pre-defined research programs, and in exchange we receive license rights to patents that may be developed under the programs. As part of these programs, we may provide compensation in the form of support for research program-related activities, reimbursement for patent related costs, as well as providing for some forms of licensing and/or sublicensing fees for licensed technology that is commercialized by us or our customers. We have expanded our sponsored research programs over the past 10 years to include additional scientific researchers at a number of different institutions that we believe can provide breakthroughs in promising new fields of research that may benefit the OLED marketplace. As of December 31, 2022, the patent rights we exclusively license from all our university research partners included more than 650 issued patents and pending patent applications in jurisdictions around the world. Under our university patent license agreements, we are generally free to sublicense to third parties all or any portion of the licensed patent rights for the life of the licensed patents, though our rights are subject to termination for an uncured material breach or default by us, or if we become bankrupt or insolvent. As part of our university license agreements, we may be required to compensate the universities to the extent we, or our sublicensees, utilize the licensed technology in commercial products. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement we are required to pay Princeton royalties for licensed products sold by us or our sublicensees. These royalties amount to 3% of the net sales price for licensed products sold by us and 3% of the revenues we receive for licensed patents used by our sublicensees. We owed royalties under the 1997 Amended License Agreement of $853,000 for 2022. Acquired Patents and Other Intellectual Property From time to time we acquire patents and other intellectual property that we believe provide strategic business opportunities, such as the patent and technology portfolio we acquired from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Motorola, Inc.) (Motorola) in 2011, and the following portfolios from Fujifilm Corporation and BASF: Patents We Acquired from Fujifilm Corporation In 2012, we entered into a Patent Sale Agreement (the Fujifilm Agreement) with Fujifilm. Under the Fujifilm Agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $109.5 million. The Fujifilm Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The Fujifilm Agreement permitted us to assign all of our rights and obligations under the Fujifilm Agreement to our affiliates, and we assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement, our rights and obligations to UDC Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. Patents We Acquired from BASF In 2016, UDC Ireland entered into an IP Transfer Agreement (the BASF Agreement) with BASF. Under the BASF Agreement, BASF sold us more than 500 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $96.0 million. The transactions contemplated by the BASF Agreement were consummated on June 28, 2016. Non-patented Technical Know-How 12 We have accumulated, and continue to accumulate, a substantial amount of non-patented technical know-how relating to OLED technologies and materials. Where practicable, we share portions of this information with display manufacturers and other business partners on a confidential basis. We also employ various methods to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, although no such methods can afford complete protection. Moreover, because we derive some of this information and know-how from academic institutions, there is an increased potential for public disclosure. We also cannot prevent the actual independent development of the same or similar information and know-how by third parties. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against alternative display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as other OLED technologies. We also compete in the lighting market against incumbent technologies, such as incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, and inorganic LEDs, and against emerging technologies, such as other OLED technologies. Display Panel Industry Competitors Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing and improving LCD, which includes quantum dot LCDs (which are sometimes referred to as QLEDs), and other display technologies that compete with our OLED display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies can compete with LCDs, QLEDs and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video rates, form factor and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur. Lighting Industry Competitors Although there has been a movement to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs throughout many countries, traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps remain well-entrenched products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state LEDs have been introduced into the market and would compete with OLED lighting products. LEDs have realized significant market adoption in the general lighting market. Having attributes different from fluorescent lamps and LEDs, OLEDs may compete directly with these products for certain lighting applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might occur. OLED Technologies and Materials Competitors Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) developed and patented the original fluorescent OLED technology in 1987. Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd. (CDT), which was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company in 2007, developed and patented polymer OLED technology in 1989. Display and lighting manufacturers, including customers of ours, are engaged in their own OLED research, development and commercialization activities, and have developed and may continue to develop proprietary OLED technologies that are necessary or useful for commercial OLED devices. In addition, other material manufacturers, such as Sumitomo, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (Idemitsu Kosan), Merck KGaA and Kyulux Inc., are selling or sampling competing OLED materials to customers, including companies to which we sell our proprietary PHOLED materials. Our licensing business is based on our control of a broad portfolio of OLED-related device patents and technologies. We believe this portfolio includes fundamental patents in the field of phosphorescent OLED materials and devices, as well as certain additional complementary OLED technologies. As discussed above, alternative technologies, such as fluorescent OLED emitter materials, exist and could be competitive to our phosphorescent OLED material solutions. However, fluorescent materials have characteristics that we believe many market participants consider less desirable than those of phosphorescent materials. Suppliers of fluorescent emitter materials include Solus Advanced Materials Co., Ltd., Dow Chemical (previously Gracel Display), Idemitsu Kosan and SFC Co. Ltd. Fluorescent materials may also be viewed as complementary in that they can be used in the same OLED stack as phosphorescent materials. The competitive landscape with respect to our host materials business is characterized by a larger number of established chemical material suppliers who have long-term relationships with many of our existing customers and licensees. We have elected to partner with certain of these companies to manufacture and deliver host solutions to our customers, as well as selling our host materials directly to device manufacturers. We believe our competitive advantage stems, in part, from our deep knowledge of our phosphorescent emitter materials, which are complementary with the host solutions. We believe that our understanding of phosphorescent emitter materials enables us to create host material solutions that are especially well suited for use with a certain class of emitter materials that are implemented commercially today. However, we note that many of our technology partners have their own host solutions and the 13 competitive landscape includes many well-established companies such as Solus Advanced Materials Co., Ltd., Dow Chemical, Duksan Neolux Co., Ltd., Idemitsu Kosan, Merck KGaA, NSCC and Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. These companies have significant resources, and some may aggressively pursue such business in the future. Our existing business relationships with SDC and other product manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve a significant level of market penetration in the display and lighting industries. However, others, such as those working to develop thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and microLED alternative technologies, may succeed in developing new OLED technologies, materials and alternative solutions that may supplement or be utilized in place of ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers will adopt and continue to utilize our OLED technologies and materials for the production of commercial displays and lighting products. Our Venture Capital Business: UDC Ventures LLC We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UDC Ventures LLC, in March 2019, as a corporate venture capital entity that funds companies we believe are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic or complementary to our business and/or business strategies or which may otherwise provide favorable investment opportunities. Human Capital As of December 31, 2022, we had 443 active full-time employees and two part-time employees, none of whom are unionized. Of these employees, 318 are research scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians at our domestic and international facilities. This team includes chemists, physicists, engineers and technicians with physics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and organic/inorganic chemistry backgrounds, and highly-trained theoreticians and experimentalists. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Our goal is to be a diverse and inclusive company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. Women represent 40% of our executive management team, 15% of our leadership (Director level and above) and 23% of our total workforce, as well as 38% of our Board of Directors. We have employees from over 25 countries in our workforce, and we believe that a diverse workforce made up of people with different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds drives employee and business success. In 2022 our voluntary turnover rate was 13%, and we had overall employee growth rate of 8%. Additional data, including historical turnover and diversity information, as well as our corporate policies relating to our employee engagement and human capital, are updated on our website www.oled.com, and included in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Company History Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1985. Our business was commenced in 1994 by a company then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. functions as an operating subsidiary of ours and has certain overlapping officers and directors. We have also formed or acquired other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited (2008), Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H.

R ISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property If we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property protection for our OLED technologies and materials, our business will suffer. The value of our OLED technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. Although we own or license many patents respecting our OLED technologies and materials that have already been issued, there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained, or that any of these patents, once issued, will afford commercially significant protection for our OLED technologies and materials, or will be found valid if challenged. Also, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending the validity of our current or future patents in pending and future patent oppositions, invalidation trials, interferences, reexaminations, reissues, or other administrative or court proceedings. Moreover, we have not obtained patent protection for some of our OLED technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which OLED products or materials might be manufactured or sold. We believe that the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent OLED devices and certain materials utilized in these devices. Certain of our existing fundamental phosphorescent OLED patents expired in the United States in 2017 and 2019; and expired in other countries of the world in 2018 and 2020. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications relating to our commercial OLED materials and technologies whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend) beyond 2022, many of which are also of importance in the OLED industry, none may be of an equally essential nature as our original fundamental patents, and therefore our competitive position may be less certain as a result of the expiration of these patents. We have more than 5,500 issued and pending patents relating to our OLED technologies. There is no assurance that these patents and applications will not be challenged prior to their respective expirations in any of the jurisdictions in which they are utilized, or that if challenged, we will be able to secure sufficient breadth of protection, and monetary and injunctive relief for the violation of our rights to make up for the business harm resulting from such activities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or produce competing PHOLED material designs that may be outside of our existing patents. There may also be fundamental new advancements in the field of OLED technology that could enable the commercial use of older and unpatented PHOLED materials or the adoption of new OLED materials that do not require the utilization of our proprietary PHOLED materials to achieve superior performance characteristics. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees. In addition, we are participating in or have participated in, and in the future will likely have to participate in, interference, reissue, or reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and opposition, nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices, with respect to some of our patents or patent applications. All of these actions place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention from our business and operations. Moreover, if successful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key OLED technologies and materials on which our business depends. 16 We rely, in part, on several non-patented proprietary technologies to operate our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Furthermore, these parties may obtain patent protection for such technology, inhibiting or preventing us from practicing the technology. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other non-patented proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other non-patented proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. Additionally, although we take many measures and implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, including by theft and misuse, of our intellectual property and proprietary information, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, reverse-engineer, use or disclose, illegally or otherwise, such intellectual property and proprietary information. We also may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems or to our intellectual property, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company or its products. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and proprietary information, it will harm our business. We or our customers may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights or with respect to our OLED materials business. There are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials, including, without limitation, Kodak (substantially all of whose OLED assets were sold to a group of LG companies in 2009), CDT (acquired by Sumitomo in 2007), Canon, Inc., Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co., Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In addition, some of our customers such as SDC and LG Display have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials. As a result, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our OLED technologies or materials, thus subjecting our customers to possible suits for patent infringement in the future. Such lawsuits could result in our customers being liable for damages or require our customers to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ sales and thus our royalties or material sales revenues, or cause our customers to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates or pricing. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify customers purchasing our OLED materials for commercial usage against certain claims of patent infringement by third parties, as a result of which we may incur substantial legal costs in connection with defending these customers from such claims. Our licensees may also seek to avoid paying future royalties by attempting to have our patents declared invalid and unenforceable by a court. Our licensees may be more likely to file such declaratory actions in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc . (2007), in which the Court found that a licensee need not refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before bringing an action to declare a licensed U. S. patent invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we may be required, from time-to-time, to assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence. Defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable. Thus, any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable. If a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents, that party and others could compete more effectively against us. Our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents would also be adversely affected. Whether our customers are defending the assertion of third-party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology, or we are asserting our own intellectual property rights against others, such litigation can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to our or our customers’ business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. As a result, the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our customers are subject could disrupt business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our customers to significant liabilities, each of which could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials continue to enter the consumer marketplace. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages. Any intellectual property litigation commenced against our customers may force them to take actions that could be harmful to their businesses and thus to revenues, including the halting of sales of products that incorporate or otherwise use our technology or materials. Furthermore, the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex and is often subjective or uncertain. If our customers were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party, the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict. Decreased sales of our customers’ products incorporating our technology or materials would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses and material sales under our existing sales agreements. 17 Were this to occur, it would likely harm our ability to (i) obtain new licensees which would have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees, and (ii) sell our UniversalPHOLED® materials to existing and new customers. Moreover, to the extent any third party claims are directed specifically to materials supplied by us to our customers, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with the defense of such claims and potential damages associated with such claims that may be awarded against our customers. As is commonplace in technology companies, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. To the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. The costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our customers’ businesses could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail. Recent court decisions in various patent cases may make it more difficult for us to obtain future patents, enforce our patents against third parties or obtain favorable judgments in cases where the patents are enforced. Recent case law may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents. For example, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc . (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court mandated a more expansive and flexible approach to determine whether a patent is obvious and invalid. As a result of the less rigid approach to assessing obviousness, defending the validity of or obtaining patents may be more difficult. Recent court decisions may also impact the enforcement of our patents. For example, we may not be able to enjoin certain third party uses of products or methods covered by our patents following the initial authorized sale, even where those uses are expressly proscribed in an agreement with the buyer. Also, we may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement of our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an injunction should not automatically issue based on a finding of patent infringement, but should be determined based on a test balancing considerations of the patentee’s interest, the infringer’s interest, and the public’s interest. Obtaining enhanced damages for willful infringement of our patents may also be more difficult even in those cases where we successfully prove a third party has infringed our patents, as a recent case set a more stringent standard for proving willful infringement. Therefore, as a result of such rulings, it may be more difficult for us to defend our currently issued patents, obtain additional patents in the future or achieve the desired competitive effect even when our patents are enforced. If we are unable to so defend our currently issued patents, or to obtain new patents for any reason, our business would suffer. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations If we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with OLED product manufacturers, our business strategy will fail. Our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high-volume manufacturers of OLED products. We have entered into a limited number of such relationships from which most of our material sales and licensing revenue are generated. Our other relationships with product manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial products. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the product manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us. Many of our agreements with product manufacturers last for only limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these manufacturers will expire unless they are renewed. These product manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis or may agree to do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we regularly continue working with product manufacturers after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with the various product manufacturers not continue or be renewed on less favorable terms, or if we are not able to identify other product manufacturers and enter into contracts with them, our business may materially suffer. Our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing relationships, may depend on our ability to make certain financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail. If we fail to continue to make advances in our OLED research and development activities, we might not succeed in continuing to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. 18 Further advances in our OLED technologies and materials depend, in part, on the success of the research and development work we conduct, both alone and with our research partners. We cannot be certain that this work will yield additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete research and development of our OLED technologies and materials successfully, or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our OLED technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. Conflicts or other problems may arise with our customers or joint development partners, resulting in renegotiation, breach or termination of, or litigation related to, our agreements with them. This would adversely affect our revenues. Conflicts or other problems could arise between us and our customers or joint development partners, some of which we have made strategic investments in, as to royalty rates, milestone payments or other commercial terms. Similarly, we may disagree with our customers or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non-commercial terms. If such a conflict were to arise, a customer or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely, and we might lose the royalty revenues, material sales revenues and other benefits of the agreement. Either we or the customer or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations, establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement. Such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management. If we were unsuccessful in such litigation, we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement, be liable for financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute. If our OLED technologies and materials are not feasible for broad-based product applications, we may not be able to continue to generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our main business strategy is to sell our OLED materials and license our OLED technologies to manufacturers for incorporation into the display and lighting products that they sell. Consequently, our success depends on the ability and willingness of manufacturers to continue to develop, manufacture and sell commercial products integrating our technologies and materials. Before product manufacturers will agree to expand the use of our OLED technologies and materials for wider scale commercial production, they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our OLED technologies and materials are feasible for broad-based product applications beyond current commercial application, such as smartphones, wearables and television displays. This, in turn, may require additional advances in our technologies and materials, as well as those of others, for applications in a number of areas, including, without limitation, advances with respect to the development of: We cannot be certain that these advances will occur, and hence our OLED technologies and materials may not be feasible for additional broad-based product applications and expansion. Even if our OLED materials and technologies are technically feasible, they may not be further adopted by product manufacturers for broad-based product applications. The potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us remain uncertain. Market acceptance of our OLED materials and technologies beyond current product offerings and sales volumes will depend, in part, upon these materials and technologies providing benefits comparable or superior to competing display and lighting technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers, and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers. Many current and potential customers for our OLED technologies utilize and have invested significant resources in competing technologies, and may, therefore, be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our OLED technologies. 19 During the entire product development process for a new product, we face the risk that our materials or technologies will fail to meet the manufacturer’s technical, performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology. Even if we offer materials and technologies that are satisfactory to a product manufacturer, the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our materials or technologies. In addition, our agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase our host materials to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials, and those customers may elect not to purchase our host materials. Mass production of new mass market OLED products will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment, components and materials, many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, there may be a number of other technologies that manufacturers need to utilize in conjunction with our OLED technologies in order to bring these new OLED products to the market. Thus, even if our OLED technologies are a viable alternative to competing approaches, if product manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components, materials and other technologies, they may not utilize our OLED technologies. There are numerous potential alternatives to OLEDs, which may limit our ability to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. The display market remains dominated by displays based on LCD technology. Numerous companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs; additionally, other competing display technologies have been, or are being, developed, like microLED. A similar situation exists in the solid-state lighting market, which is currently dominated by LED products. Advances in any of these various technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies in their field, either of which could limit the potential market for products utilizing our OLED technologies and materials. This, in turn, would cause product manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us, or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us. Other OLED technologies may be more successful or cost-effective than ours, which may limit the commercial adoption of our OLED technologies and materials. Our competitors have developed and continue to develop OLED technologies that differ from or compete with our OLED technologies. In particular, competing fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLED technology may become a viable alternative to our phosphorescent OLED technology. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new OLED technologies that may become more cost-effective or have fewer limitations than our OLED technologies. If our OLED technologies, and particularly our phosphorescent OLED technology, are unable to continue to capture a substantial portion of the OLED product market, our business strategy may fail. The consumer electronics industry experiences significant downturns from time to time, any of which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our OLED technologies and materials. Our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our customers to manufacture and sell products utilizing our technologies and materials, specifically our phosphorescent emitters and host materials, and the widespread acceptance of our customers’ products in the consumer marketplace. Any slowdown in the demand for our customers’ products or a decrease in our customers’ use of or demand for our materials would adversely affect our material sales and royalty revenues and thus our business. Our customers’ decrease in the use of or demand for our materials may depend on several factors, including pricing, availability, continued technical improvements and competitive product offerings. The markets for flat panel displays and lighting products are highly competitive. Success in the market for end-user products that may integrate our OLED technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our customers and us, including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end-user markets that our customers serve, as well as industry and general economic conditions. The markets that we hope to penetrate have experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Our business strategy is dependent on manufacturers building and selling products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for displays and solid-state lighting products could cause significant harm to our business. Our customers may develop new or more efficient manufacturing processes, which may adversely affect demand for our OLED materials. By developing enhanced material processing methods and more efficient manufacturing techniques, our customers who purchase our phosphorescent emitter and host materials could become more efficient in the utilization of our materials by developing designs that 20 require less materials on a per square meter basis, or by modifying their manufacturing process to make more efficient use of our materials, which could limit or reduce the amount of materials they purchase from us. Thus, demand for our materials may not expand in proportion to the number of OLED related products manufactured by our customers, and may result in reduced demand for our materials and technologies relative to our customers' manufacture and sale of products made with such materials. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations and business, and similar future epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises could also have a similar effect. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, which in turn has had a material adverse effect on our operations and business. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively continue to impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. Should there be in the future any epidemics, pandemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that harm the global economy in general, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience impacts to certain of our customers as a result of public health crises occurring in one or more locations, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any downturn in U.S. or global economic conditions may have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been significant and sustained economic downturns in the U.S. and globally in the past. These downturns have placed pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had a material adverse effect on the demand for consumer electronic products. Similar downturns in the future may have a significant adverse effect on one or more of our licensees as an enterprise, which could result in those licensees reducing their efforts to commercialize products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Consumer demand and the condition of the display and lighting industries may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, epidemics and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the demand for our customers’ products, and thus our business. Heightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macro-economic conditions, including slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates and currency fluctuations, present a risk for us, our suppliers and the display and lighting industries in general. If inflation remains at current levels for an extended period, or increases, and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our costs are likely to increase, resulting in pressure on our profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts. In addition, our business could be adversely impacted if our customers experience budget, inflationary or other pressures, such as increases in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rates. Many of our competitors have greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them. The display and solid-state lighting industries are characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and research capabilities than we do. Because of these differences, we may never be able to compete successfully in these markets or maintain any competitive advantages we are able to achieve over time. If we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow, our business might not succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical and managerial personnel, and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to these and our other employees. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key technical or managerial personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is intense. We might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail. 21 We rely solely on PPG to manufacture the OLED materials we use and sell to product manufacturers. Our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary OLED materials for our own use and for sale to product manufacturers. Our agreement with PPG provides us with a source for these materials for development, evaluation and commercial purposes. Our agreement with PPG currently runs through the end of 2024 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Our inability to continue obtaining these OLED materials from PPG or another source at cost-competitive prices and to continue obtaining these OLED materials in sufficient quantities to meet our product manufacturers' current and future demands and timetables would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cost of goods sold relating to sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers, as well as on our ability to perform future development work. Additionally, PPG manufactures our materials at facilities based in the United States and Ireland. As a result, such materials may be subject to tariffs or other barriers from or to countries where some of our product manufacturer customers have operations and to where we would need to ship product. Inflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for raw materials or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing our OLED materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for our materials. In addition, any increase in the cost or reduced availability of critical materials for our OLED materials could lead to higher production costs. Further, uncertain supply of such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. Geopolitical risks and crises, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar, and other economic and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for raw materials and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass these costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs. We strive to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to accommodate our manufacturing customers. Inventory management relating to our material sales is complex, and excess inventory may harm our business and cause it to suffer. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels of our OLED materials to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As a just-in-time supplier to our customers, we carry sufficient inventory to accommodate their capacity requirements, sometimes without firm purchase commitments. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers to provide our materials to us exposes us to longer lead times than if we were a direct manufacturer, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively. Our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply and demand of their products by end-users, or the supply and demand of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them. Inventory management risks are heightened when our largest customers launch new products and retire existing products. At such times, these customers tend to change product designs and may introduce some of our new materials into new designs. The production of these materials requires us to purchase essential raw material and commence manufacturing well in advance of receiving firm customer orders for such materials. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of unanticipated changes in our customers’ manufacturing plans and designs. Unanticipated product cessation and product introduction delays or cancellation may cause us to order or produce excess or insufficient inventory. Excess inventory of our OLED materials is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and inventory write-downs. We are the sole source supplier for certain critical components used in OLED technologies, which subjects customers to risk if we are unable to meet the demand for such components. Our customers depend on us as the sole source for certain proprietary PHOLED materials used in manufacturing OLED products, which makes them susceptible to supply shortages if we are unable to meet their demand for such components. A potential customer could be hesitant to adopt OLED technology given the risks inherent in depending on a sole source for critical components and the inability to establish alternate supply relationships. If we are unable to supply the components needed by our existing customers in a 22 timely manner, or if potential customers do not utilize OLED technology because of concerns about our ability to meet supply demands, our business may materially suffer. Because the vast majority of OLED product manufacturers are located in the Asia-Pacific region, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations. Many of our customers and prospective customers have a majority of their operations in countries other than the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and revenue outside the United States represents a majority of our total net revenue. We also have offices in various countries located outside of the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include, without limitation: Any of these factors could impair our ability to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials, thereby harming our business. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. We rely on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. We are dependent on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit important data and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third-party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors, that could adversely affect our business. Natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or earthquakes, particularly in Asia-Pacific region, where many of our customers are located, or the occurrence of other unforeseen catastrophic events, such a fire or flood, could unfavorably affect our business and financial performance. Such events could unfavorably affect our customers in many ways, such as causing physical damage to one or more of their properties, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more plants, the disruption or cessation of manufacturing of product lines, and the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or demand for their products. A resulting by-product of such natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could be a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of or demand for our products. 23 Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Tax Matters We may be subject to environmental laws and regulations, including without limitation those associated with the effects of climate change, that impose additional compliance costs and that could negatively impact our business. Changes in environmental laws or regulations of our products could result in higher operating and compliance expenses and limit the markets in which we can manufacture and to which we can export our products. Changes in environmental laws or regulations, including laws relating to manufacturing operations and export restrictions, also could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and an increase in raw materials costs, and could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. Some of these laws and regulations may be changed or augmented as governments and regulatory bodies seek to address the effects of climate change. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial condition. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and business operations, and adversely impact our shareholders. Occasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. Risks Related to Our Stock and Capitalization We may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business. Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We may require additional funding in the future for the research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all our future needs. When we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain more money when needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or depositary shares, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these shares will dilute our then-existing shareholders. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies, particularly other emerging-growth companies in the technology industry. Factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future: 24 Our operating results may have significant period-to-period fluctuations, which would make it difficult to predict our future performance. Due to the current stage of commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, current geopolitical risks, the limited number of commercially successful consumer products utilizing our OLED technologies that customers have introduced in the marketplace, the relatively short product lifetimes of these consumer products, and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our customers must achieve for the widespread inclusion of our OLED technologies in consumer products such as mobile phones, tablets, television displays and lighting products, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time. Among other factors affecting our period-to-period results, our license and technology development fees often consist of large one-time, annual, semi-annual or quarterly payments, which may result in significant fluctuations in our revenues. In addition, our reliance on a relatively small number of licensees with large volumes of consumer product sales makes our quarterly operating results subject to our licensees’ specific plans and the success of their specific product offerings. With respect to material sales, our sales are primarily dependent on purchases made by a relatively small number of customers. In addition to the other factors described above relating to our customers’ sales opportunities, our quarter-to-quarter sales may be materially impacted by our customers’ inventory management plans, which may vary substantially based on financial management considerations, changes in their product mix plans, modified material processing techniques and manufacturing line modifications. If, in some future period, our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price. Broad market, industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock. The price of our common stock could decrease if: We can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could: As of February 23, 2023, we have issued and outstanding 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of Sherwin I. Seligsohn, our late founder and former Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past, none of which are currently outstanding, and may do so again at any time in the future. Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In 2017, our Board of Directors began declaring quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have consistently paid since then and we intend to continue to pay in the future. However, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other 25 factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which current shareholders purchased their shares. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLV ED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our material sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 In September 2022, the Opposition Division made a final determination that the patent, which was described in prior filings and has now expired in accordance with its original term, was valid based on amended claims submitted by us to the Opposition Division in 2016. 26 ITEM 4.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOC KHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our Common Stock Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market website under the symbol “OLED.” As of February 23, 2023, there were approximately 275 holders of record of our common stock. During 2020, 2021 and 2022, we declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock. While we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends in the future, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. 28 Performance Graph The performance graph below compares the change in the cumulative shareholder return of our common stock from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2022, with the percentage change in the cumulative total return over the same period on (i) the Russell 2000 Index, and (ii) the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index.

[RESERVED] None. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” in this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Item 1A of this report, entitled “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. On December 2, 2022, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of red and green phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. 31 In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) which has operations in New Castle and Wilmington, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2022, Adesis employed a team of 150 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of December 31, 2022, OVJP Corp employed a team of 22 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. We currently lease the Shannon site and have a contractual option to purchase the facility. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. The first phase of facility improvements has been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: 32 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics, epidemics and disease outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have a gradually lesser impact during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, there is the potential for continued impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what effects any such potential actions could have on our business, including on our customers, employees, and financial results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue and income taxes, as described below, are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the sale of our OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to our OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. We believe that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. We estimate total material units to be purchased by our customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and our forecast process. Our management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, our management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of our customers over the contract term. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. 33 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of our assessment, we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2022, based on our previous earnings history, a current evaluation of expected future taxable income and other evidence, we determined to retain the valuation allowance that relates to New Jersey research and development credits and unrealized loss on investments. Actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is generated in future periods. To the extent we establish a new valuation allowance or change a previously established valuation allowance in a future period, income tax expense will be impacted. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For a discussion of our results of operations comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed on February 23, 2022. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Decrease) Increase REVENUE: Material sales $ 331,081 $ 318,623 $ 12,458 Royalty and license fees 267,115 219,032 48,083 Contract research services 18,423 15,870 2,553 Total revenue 616,619 553,525 63,094 COST OF SALES 127,896 114,991 12,905 Gross margin 488,723 438,534 50,189 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 117,062 99,673 17,389 Selling, general and administrative 77,886 80,372 (2,486 ) Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 17,459 21,994 (4,535 ) Patent costs 8,329 8,160 169 Royalty and license expense 877 691 186 Total operating expenses 221,613 210,890 10,723 OPERATING INCOME 267,110 227,644 39,466 Interest income, net 7,811 505 7,306 Other (loss) income, net (6,691 ) 98 (6,789 ) Interest and other income, net 1,120 603 517 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 268,230 228,247 39,983 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (58,169 ) (44,034 ) (14,135 ) NET INCOME $ 210,061 $ 184,213 $ 25,848 Revenue Our total material sales were $331.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 4%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $267.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $219.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 22%. This increase was primarily the result of a favorable cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price and higher unit material volume. 34 The cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was $30.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from an increase in the average price per gram that was primarily due to the decrease in anticipated demand by several of our customers over the remaining lives of their contracts, resulting from the continued deterioration in the global market economy as evidenced by weakness in consumer demand caused by higher interest rates and inflationary pricing pressures. At this time, substantial uncertainty exists as to the projected duration and intensity of this global market deterioration and the extent to which it will negatively impact such customers' near-term production requirements. Contract research services revenue was $18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of 16%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $12.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales with an associated increase in manufacturing costs, underutilization of the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and higher per unit material costs. The underutilization charges related to the Shannon facility were $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Shannon facility charges began to be recorded as cost of sales in June 2022 when the facility was first used for production activities. Shannon facility costs prior to June 2022 were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. We anticipate that the Shannon facility will continue to be underutilized in the near-term as we have begun to bring this additional capacity online in preparation for anticipated growth in the years ahead. Included in the cost of sales for both fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was an increase in inventory reserve of $3.6 million due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees and material sales, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $50.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue remaining consistent at 79%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased contract research and PPG development activity, higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation, partially offset by increased pre-production costs associated with the Shannon facility, an increase in depreciation expense resulting from corporate expansion, as well as an increase in overall general office expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $17.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to the Fujifilm patents becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. 35 Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $877,000 for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest and other (loss) income, net Interest income, net was $7.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $505,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to an increase in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year as well as higher available-for-sale investment balances. Other (loss) income, net primarily consisted of impairment of minority investments of $7.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other loss, net of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to other income, net of $98,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 21.7% and 19.3% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $58.2 million and $44.0 million, respectively, for those periods. The effective income tax rate increased due to a change in U.S. tax legislation associated with the ability to credit Chinese withholding taxes, as well as the impact to the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) arising from a change in the capitalization rules for research and development expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $93.4 million, short-term investments of $484.3 million, and long-term corporate bond and U.S. Government bond investments of $247.9 million for a total of $825.6 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million, short-term investments of $351.2 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $159.6 million for a total of $822.8 million as of December 31, 2021. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $126.8 million resulting from $210.1 million of net income and an increase of $51.0 million due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization of intangibles and deferred income taxes, partially offset by a $134.3 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to a decrease in deferred revenue of $93.2 million, an increase in inventory of $49.1 million and a decrease in other liabilities of $11.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $15.0 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.3 million and a decrease in other assets of $1.1 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $191.1 million resulting from $184.2 million of net income and an increase of $88.5 million due to non-cash items including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and depreciation, partially offset by a $81.6 million reduction due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in inventory of $42.6 million, an increase in other assets of $32.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $25.4 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $5.2 million, partially offset by an increase in other liabilities of $22.3 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.9 million. Cash used in investing activities was $280.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $457.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $233.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $414.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, partially offset by an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in intangible purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to a patent purchase. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland and improvements to our facilities in Ewing, New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $19.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $5.7 million and an increase in the proceeds from issuance of common stock of $63,000. 36 Working capital was $763.8 million as of December 31, 2022, as compared to $738.0 million as of December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, a decrease in deferred revenue and an increase in inventory, partially offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents. Several significant contractual obligations are anticipated to be incurred in future periods and include payments for retirement benefit plan obligations, lease obligations and PPG inventory commitments. Payments towards the retirement plan obligations will commence during fiscal year 2023 in the amount of $2.0 million and are expected to total $93.1 million over the life of the plan. Existing lease obligations are $4.6 million for fiscal year 2023, $9.3 million in total for fiscal years 2023 and 2024 and $21.6 million thereafter. Existing PPG inventory commitments are $31.9 million and will fluctuate based on PPG production needs to fulfill to our demand for commercial emitter material. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those statements are attached to this report beginning on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective 37 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The report of management on our internal control over financial reporting and the associated attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm are set forth in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION On February 21, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of its Human Capital Committee, authorized the issuance of 19,265 shares of the Company’s common stock to Mr. Sidney Rosenblatt, the Company’s former EVP and Chief Financial Officer who retired on December 31, 2022, and a current member of the Board. The number of shares issued to Mr. Rosenblatt equals the number of shares he would have received, but for his retirement, during the first quarter of 2023, upon the vesting of one-third of each of the time-based restricted share unit grants made in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance to Mr. Rosenblatt of the number of shares of common stock that would have been issued to him, with respect to the three-year performance period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022, upon the vesting of the performance-based portion of the grant made to him in 2020 under the Company’s long-term incentive equity compensation plan. Such number of shares shall be determined in March 2023 when the determinations of performance with respect to the 2020 - 2022 performance period are made by the Human Capital Committee. Also on February 21, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the amendment and restatement of the Universal Display Corporation Annual Incentive Plan (the “AIP”), originally established and in effect since 2013. The AIP is a bonus plan pursuant to which eligible senior executive employees of the Company may earn a bonus based on the achievement of performance objectives, and is administered by the Human Capital Committee. All senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the AIP. Annual bonus awards are awarded to eligible participants on an annual basis, if the performance goals established by the Committee are met. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Human Capital Committee establishes each participant's target and maximum bonus award, the performance goals applicable to the bonus award, and such other conditions as the Committee deems appropriate. The performance goals may provide for differing amounts to be paid (e.g., threshold, target, and maximum amounts) based on differing levels of performance. The performance goals may relate to the financial performance of the Company and its subsidiaries or one or more business units, and, where appropriate, they may relate to a participant's personal performance. The foregoing description of the AIP is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the AIP, which is attached to this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 10.14 and incorporated by reference herein.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based upon criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been attested to by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the following page. Steven V. Abramson President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Millard Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer February 23, 2023 F- 2 Report of Independent R e gistered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 23, 2023 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts As discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for organic light emitting diode (OLED) sales to customers with long-term contracts (i.e., over 1 year in length) using certain estimates. Revenue is determined by estimating total contract consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract and recognized based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. The estimated per unit fee includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees, as well as estimates of material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. The Company uses internal and external data to estimate material units to be sold and royalty consideration to be received over the contract terms. We identified the assessment of the estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts as a critical audit matter. The estimated per unit fee was dependent upon the estimates of total material units to be sold. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating the forecasted material unit sales, as changes in the estimates could significantly affect the estimated per unit fee. F- 4 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including the Company’s review and approval of forecasted quantities of material unit sales of OLED products. We assessed the Company’s forecasting policies and procedures and the inputs used in making the estimates by considering other reasonably likely outcomes when evaluating potential management bias. Additionally, we inspected the forecast calculations for a selection of OLED contracts and compared the per-material unit prices and royalty rates used against the respective contract terms. We compared the OLED material unit sales forecast to internal operating and production budgets, and we compared the forecasted OLED material unit sales to the results of inquiries of Company personnel, publicly available market data, and analyst reports. We assessed the Company’s ability to accurately forecast OLED material unit sales by comparing recent historical forecasts to actual results and evaluating the Company’s conclusions regarding the reasons for changes in the current year’s estimates as compared to prior estimates. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F- 10 UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light and can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, monitor, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, monitors, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (UDC Korea), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents F- 11 The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company’s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties and license fees. These receivables have historically been paid timely. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant collection risk. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for credit losses would be required. The allowance for credit losses was $ 279,000 at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 30 years for buildings, 15 years for building improvements, and three to seven years for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any gain or loss is reflected in other operating expenses. Certain costs of computer software obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . Costs for maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to an existing system, are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Company management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31, 2022, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company’s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. Company management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If it is concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment assessment is not necessary. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, then its carrying value is written down to fair value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of F- 12 a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. If necessary, the second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022 utilizing a qualitative evaluation and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Adesis is greater than its carrying value. Future impairment tests will continue to be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs. As of December 31, 2022, no indications of impairment existed. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. The impairment in the value of minority equity investments is included in the other (loss) income, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. F- 13 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, they are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the sales-based portion of royalty revenue based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or predetermined rates on a contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), replacing a previous license agreement that had been in place since 2018. This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2023 and lasts through the end of 2027 with an additional two-year extension option for SDC. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, which includes quarterly and annual payments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC, which lasts for the same term as the license agreement and is subject to the same extension option. This new material purchase agreement replaced a previous purchase agreement that had been in place since 2018. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase red and green phosphorescent emitter materials from the Company for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This amount purchased is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of these agreements were extended by a January 1, 2021 amendment through the end of 2025. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the lives of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue. F- 14 In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partner's, and at the Company's internal, manufacturing processing facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for the BASF patents. The Fujifilm acquired technology was fully amortized over a period of 10 years that ended in July 2022. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. F- 15 Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland and UDC Korea subsidiaries are also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's other Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved, and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 450-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which require disclosures about a buyer's supplier finance program. The adoption of ASU 2022-04, beginning on January 1, 2023, will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . Under this standard, a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered in measuring the security's fair value. The standard also requires certain disclosures for equity securities that are subject to contractual restrictions. ASU 2022-03 becomes effective January 1, 2024, and the Company is evaluating the potential impact of this standard on its investments. The Company’s portfolio of marketable fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as F- 16 available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2022 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 86,268 $ — $ — $ 86,268 Money market accounts 7,162 — — 7,162 $ 93,430 $ — $ — $ 93,430 December 31, 2021 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 256,878 $ — $ — $ 256,878 Money market accounts 55,115 — — 55,115 $ 311,993 $ — $ — $ 311,993 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2022 Corporate bonds 150,698 — ( 910 ) 149,788 U.S. Government bonds 339,472 32 ( 4,947 ) 334,557 $ 490,170 $ 32 $ ( 5,857 ) $ 484,345 December 31, 2021 Certificates of deposit $ 240 $ — $ — $ 240 Corporate bonds 226,448 3 ( 97 ) 226,354 U.S. Government bonds 124,611 — ( 11 ) 124,600 $ 351,299 $ 3 $ ( 108 ) $ 351,194 Long-term Corporate Bonds and U.S. Government Bonds Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of long-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Long-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2022 Corporate bonds $ 2,479 $ — $ ( 28 ) $ 2,451 U.S. Government bonds 247,464 52 ( 2,152 ) 245,364 $ 249,943 $ 52 $ ( 2,180 ) $ 247,815 December 31, 2021 U.S. Government bonds $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 Long-term Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company typically does not seek to obtain representation on the boards of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments, which include convertible notes, are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had four minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 12.0 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values as compared to two minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 8.5 million as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment in the value of two of its minority investments, an impairment of an equity security investment in the amount of $ 3.0 million and an impairment of a long-term F- 17 convertible note investment of $ 4.0 million which had been acquired in the current year. The impairment in the value of these minority investments are included in the other (loss) income, net line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2022 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 7,162 $ 7,162 $ — $ — Short-term investments 484,345 484,345 — — Long-term corporate and U.S. Government bonds investments 247,815 247,815 — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 55,115 $ 55,115 $ — $ — Short-term investments 351,194 351,194 — — Long-term U.S. Government bonds investments 159,568 159,568 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021. Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Raw materials $ 115,448 $ 75,227 Work-in-process 7,626 16,065 Finished goods 60,146 42,868 Inventory $ 183,220 $ 134,160 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 3.6 million, $ 3.6 million and $ 1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. F- 18 Property and equipment, net consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Land $ 2,642 $ 2,642 Building and improvements 99,586 76,600 Office and lab equipment 129,697 107,168 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 18,071 16,221 Construction-in-progress 10,567 18,662 260,563 221,293 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 117,118 ) ( 92,461 ) Property and equipment, net $ 143,445 $ 128,832 Depreciation expense was $ 24.8 million, $ 20.0 million and $ 15.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed intellectual property (IP) processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology primarily consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 Other 5,212 462 228,053 223,303 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 189,671 ) ( 173,635 ) Acquired technology, net $ 38,382 $ 49,668 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 16.0 million, $ 20.6 million and $ 20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 10.1 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2023, 2024, and 2025, $ 5.3 million in the year ending December 31, 2026, $ 521,000 in the year ending December 31, 2027 and $ 2.3 million in total thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus $ 4.5 million in costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $ 105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which was amortized over a period of 10 years ending in July 2022. F- 19 BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years . Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million to internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At December 31, 2022, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 5,887 ) $ 4,633 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 2,068 ) 2,752 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 968 ) 532 Other 396 ( 66 ) 330 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 17,236 $ ( 8,989 ) $ 8,247 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 1.4 million for each of the next four fiscal years (2023 - 2026), $ 1.3 million for the year ending December 31, 2027 and $ 1.3 million in total thereafter. Goodwill As a result of the Adesis acquisition, the Company recorded $ 15.5 million of goodwill. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year unless events suggest an impairment may have been incurred in an interim period using Adesis’ standalone financial operating performance information. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires the exercise of judgment, including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit, as Adesis is considered to be the reporting unit. As part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022, there were no significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Adesis had occurred. Other assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Long-term taxes receivable $ 63,915 $ 103,260 Right-of-use assets 31,486 30,614 Long-term contract assets 11,651 — Other long-term assets 2,687 1,836 Other assets $ 109,739 $ 135,710 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on right-of-use assets and non-current taxes receivable, respectively. The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include F- 20 options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2022, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 4,436 $ 3,637 $ 2,091 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 4,750 $ 26,174 $ 1,948 The following table presents the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Right-of-use assets $ 31,486 $ 30,614 Short-term lease liabilities 3,737 3,351 Long-term lease liabilities 29,039 27,263 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: December 31, 2022 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.7 Weighted average discount rate 3.4 % As of December 31, 2022, current operating leases had remaining terms between one and nine years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2022, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2023 $ 4,616 2024 4,643 2025 4,696 2026 4,722 2027 4,624 Thereafter 12,211 Total lease payments 35,512 Less: imputed interest ( 4,026 ) Present value of lease payments $ 31,486 F- 21 Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Compensation $ 31,751 $ 27,686 PPG Industries, Inc. agreement 9,864 8,853 Consulting 910 1,314 Professional fees 906 1,000 Royalties 877 691 Research and development agreements 662 1,469 Other 6,032 4,461 Accrued expenses $ 51,002 $ 45,474 The Company has long-standing relationships with a number of academic institutions that undertake funded research projects, including Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC). Under the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the universities have granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by the universities for the Company. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 853,000 , $ 691,000 and $ 11.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also makes payments under the current research agreement with USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 2.0 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the agreement of $ 905,000 , $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Long-term lease liabilities $ 29,039 $ 27,263 Long-term taxes payable 14,592 47,791 Other long-term liabilities 54 1,023 Other liabilities $ 43,685 $ 76,077 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on long-term lease liabilities and long-term taxes payable, respectively. On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG) (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which, effective as of October 1, 2011, replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, F- 22 however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares have been issued for services rendered by PPG since the inception of the contract. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. In February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements have been completed and operations commenced in June 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 7.3 million, $ 3.6 million and $ 2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial OLED chemicals. Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock.

Restricted Stock Award and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to five years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock unit (RSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2022 226,984 $ 184.93 Granted 124,772 140.37 Vested ( 101,909 ) 176.84 Forfeited ( 19,624 ) 175.29 Unvested, December 31, 2022 230,223 $ 165.10 The weighted average grant-date fair value per unit of RSU awards granted was $ 140.37 , $ 208.67 and $ 162.32 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

F- 25 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to restricted stock awards and units issued to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 14.3 million, $ 15.4 million and $ 13.9 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 2.2 million, $ 2.5 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively, and research and development expense of $ 6.1 million, $ 5.2 million and $ 4.3 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, 54,856 , 69,798 and 86,442 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 8.4 million, $ 14.1 million and $ 12.5 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked-to-market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 234,000 , $ 220,000 and $ 380,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.3 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 8,784 , 5,412 and 6,456 shares during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized expense related to all restricted stock awards and units was $ 27.9 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.91 years. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to EBITDA and cash flow achievement, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a three-year performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is three times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's performance falls below certain thresholds, the performance units will not vest at all. The following table summarizes the activity related to performance unit awards (PSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2022 182,954 $ 189.24 Granted 101,889 186.66 Vested ( 11,364 ) 163.23 Forfeited ( 45,613 ) 199.77 Unvested, December 31, 2022 227,866 $ 185.57 During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted 100,621 , 77,086 and 95,772 performance units, respectively, of which 75,465 , 42,291 and 47,885 units, respectively, are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 25,156 , 34,795 and 47,887 units, respectively, are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described above. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were 1,268 , no ne, and 15,638 incremental performance-based shares, respectively, that vested resulting from an increased vesting factor based on Company performance. The weighted average grant date fair value per unit of the performance unit awards granted was $ 186.66 , $ 214.70 and $ 167.74 during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. The grant date fair value of PSUs that vested during the year was $ 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The fair value of PSUs as of their respective vesting dates was $ 1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, $ 2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance unit awards was $ 13.7 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.87 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued 17,057 , 9,156 and 9,668 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.6 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded charges of $ 107,000 , $ 93,000 and $ 96,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 141,000 , $ 119,000 , $ 111,000 , respectively, to cost of sales and $ 224,000 , $ 188,000 and $ 139,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted a total of 2,024 and 1,400 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of the shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains the Universal Display Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan covers substantially all full-time employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to 90 % of their total compensation to the Plan, not to exceed the limit as defined in the Code. Once an employee is eligible to participate in the Plan, the Company will make a non-elective contribution equal to 3 % of the employee’s total compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company contributed $ 1.4 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, to the Plan. Defined Benefit Plan On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain F- 27 of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of December 31, 2022 there were eight participants in the SERP. The SERP benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and in certain cases, the participant's average annual bonus for the most recent three fiscal years ending prior to the participant's date of termination of employment with the Company for the life of the participant. For this purpose, annual base salary means 12 times the average monthly base salary paid or payable to the participant during the 24 -month period immediately preceding the participant’s date of termination of employment, or, if required, the date of a change in control of the Company. Under the SERP, if a participant resigns or is terminated without cause at or after age 65 and with at least 20 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. The benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and bonus for the life of the participant. This percentage is 50 %, 25 % or 15 %, depending on the participant’s benefit class. If a participant resigns at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit. If a participant is terminated without cause or on account of a disability after at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit in either case would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20 . In the event a participant is terminated for cause, his or her SERP benefit and any future benefit payments are subject to immediate forfeiture. The SERP benefit is payable in installments over 10 years, beginning at the later of age 65 or the date of the participant’s separation from service. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancy of the participant. This calculation is made as of the date benefit payments are to begin (later of age 65 or separation from service). If the participant dies after reaching age 65, any future or remaining benefit payments are made to the participant’s beneficiary or estate. If the participant dies before reaching age 65, the benefit is forfeited. In the event of a change in control of the Company, each participant will become immediately vested in his or her SERP benefit. Unless the participant’s benefit has already fully vested, if the participant has less than 20 years of service at the time of the change in control, he or she will receive a prorated benefit based on his or her number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. If the change in control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then each participant (including former employees who are entitled to SERP benefits) will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the benefit immediately upon the change in control. Certain of the Company’s executive officers are designated as special participants under the SERP. If these participants resign or are terminated without cause after 20 years of service, or at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, they will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. If they are terminated without cause or on account of a disability, they will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. The SERP benefit for special participants is based on 50 % of their annual base salary and bonus for their life and the life of their surviving spouse, if any. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancies of the participant and their surviving spouse, if any. If they die before reaching age 65, the benefit is not forfeited if the surviving spouse, if any, lives until the participant would have reached age 65. If their spouse also dies before the participant would have reached age 65, the benefit is forfeited. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates, and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. In connection with the initiation and subsequent amendments of the SERP, the Company recorded cost related to prior service of $ 12.5 million as accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2022. The prior service cost is being amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average of the remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ending December 31, 2023 is $ 1.3 million. F- 28 Information relating to the Company’s plan is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 66,773 $ 78,527 Service cost 1,287 1,675 Interest cost 1,383 1,165 Actuarial (gain) loss ( 7,639 ) ( 14,956 ) Plan amendment — 362 Benefit obligation, end of year 61,804 66,773 Fair value of plan assets — — Unfunded status of the plan, end of year $ 61,804 $ 66,773 Current liability $ 2,014 $ — Non-current liability $ 59,790 $ 66,773 The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan was $ 59.5 million and $ 63.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The actuarial gain of $ 7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate. The actuarial gain of $ 15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a reduction in the three-year average cash bonus paid to participants. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Service cost $ 1,287 $ 1,675 $ 1,092 Interest cost 1,383 1,165 1,285 Amortization of prior service cost 1,119 1,099 1,098 Amortization of loss 1,487 4,936 2,181 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 5,276 $ 8,875 $ 5,656 The measurement date is the Company’s fiscal year end. The net periodic pension cost is based on assumptions determined at the prior year end measurement date. Assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Discount rate 4.94 % 2.16 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.16 % 1.54 % 2.64 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over future years based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants, when the accumulation of such gains or losses exceeds 10 % of the year end benefit obligation. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost or credit) is included in the Company’s results of income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. F- 29 The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the net periodic pension cost in 2023 are as follows (in thousands): Amortization of prior service cost $ 815 Amortization of loss 480 Total $ 1,295 Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future service, are currently expected to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year Projected Benefits 2023 $ 2,014 2024 5,785 2025 5,785 2026 7,101 2027 7,539 2028-2032 41,093 Thereafter 23,737 Commitments Under the current research agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by it under that agreement, and by the University of Michigan (Michigan) under a subcontractor agreement that Michigan has with USC. Under the terms of the current license agreement among the Company, Princeton and USC, the Company makes royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 31.9 million, $ 25.7 million and $ 13.7 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. F- 30 Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 In September 2022, the Opposition Division made a final determination that the patent, which was described in prior filings and has now expired in accordance with its original term, was valid based on amended claims submitted by the Company to the Opposition Division in 2016.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit and unrealized loss on investments. The U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for the years ended December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2017 was closed in September 2022, resulting in a refund of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld. The Company will amend the U.S. federal tax returns to reflect the refund and to redetermine the foreign tax credit amount. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 18.8 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 to offset the tax payable amount. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 3.0 million and $ 36.9 million and a long-term payable of none and $ 16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government. The Company also recorded a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million on the December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Consolidated Balance Sheets. On December 27, 2018, regarding the withholding taxes for the years 2018 to 2022, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are considered Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2022. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed during October 2021 with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from January 1, 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has since been advised by a prominent Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. The Company has also filed an administrative hearing request with the Korean Tax Tribunal in order to expedite the refund process and the case remains pending. The Company plans to file a refund request for over-withheld taxes from the third quarter of 2021 to December 31, 2022. The Company will also amend U.S. federal tax returns for the 2018 to 2020 years when the anticipated refund from KNTS is received to offset the additional tax liability and to redetermine the research and development credit utilization. In November 2022, the Company prepaid $ 16.0 million to the IRS under Rev. Proc. 2005-18 that relates to the anticipated tax payable. As a result, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 60.9 million and $ 53.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a long-term liability of $ 14.6 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, for the estimated amounts due to the U.S. federal government based on the amendment of the Company's U.S. tax returns indicating that lower withholding amounts were required. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that pertained to the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding taxes and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland engaged a prominent Korean law firm which believed it was more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland had beneficial ownership of the F- 33 underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland paid the assessment which was recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2021. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled in favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021, upon which the KNTS appealed the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from the KNTS which resulted in UDC Ireland recovering the charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding taxes plus interest for the three-year period in February 2022. The Company is not subject to examinations by the U.S. federal tax authority for the years prior to 2010. The Company's state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The Company is currently under a California state tax audit for the years 2019 and 2020, which is in the information-collecting stage. The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis, respectively. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with the Company's contracts from customers (in thousands): As of December 31, 2022 Accounts receivable $ 92,664 Short-term unbilled receivables 24,073 Short-term contract assets 2,733 Long-term contract assets 11,651 Short-term deferred revenue 45,599 Long-term deferred revenue 18,279 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables and contract assets are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets represent consideration related to the renewal of customer contracts which is recognized over the contract term based on material units sold. The deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 21.9 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. F- 34 Significant changes in the assets and liabilities balances associated with the Company's contracts from customers for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 239,608 Increases due to cash received — ( 176,667 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 30,262 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 15,946 — Contract assets recorded, net 14,384 — Net change 30,330 93,203 Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 38,457 $ ( 63,878 ) Year Ended December 31, 2021 Assets Liabilities Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 192,778 Increases due to cash received — ( 201,484 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 13,926 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 32,720 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 35,022 ) — Net change ( 2,302 ) 5,220 Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) The c umulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $ 16.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net was primarily due to a decrease in anticipated customer demand over their remaining contract lives. The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. F- 35 The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Numerator: Net income $ 210,061 $ 184,213 $ 133,372 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 1,215 ) ( 1,137 ) ( 1,001 ) Adjusted net income $ 208,846 $ 183,076 $ 132,371 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,390,352 47,296,447 47,198,982 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 2,340 1,010 1,566 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 75,815 67,978 36,446 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,468,507 47,365,435 47,236,994 Net income per common share: Basic $ 4.41 $ 3.87 $ 2.80 Diluted $ 4.40 $ 3.87 $ 2.80 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 122,843 , none and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive.

BU SINESS Our Company We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), portable media device and automotive markets. We believe that this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. Our technology leadership, our current intellectual property position, and our more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable us to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. Our primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize our proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. We have established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through our internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. We currently own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. We manufacture and sell our proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. We also enter into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which we grant them licenses to practice under our patents and to use our proprietary know-how. At the same time, we work with these and other companies that are evaluating our OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Market Overview The Display Panel Market Thin, energy-efficient display panels that can be manufactured on glass or flexible substrates are essential for a wide variety of portable consumer electronics products, such as mobile phones, AR/VR headsets, digital cameras, wearables, tablets and notebook computers. Due to their narrow profile and light weight, flat panel displays are the display of choice for larger product applications, such as computer monitors and televisions. Liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, continue to dominate the flat panel display market. However, we believe that OLED displays are an attractive alternative to LCDs, and OLED displays are gaining market share, because they offer a number of potential advantages, including: Based on these characteristics, product manufacturers have adopted small-area OLED displays for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables and tablets. Manufacturers are increasingly commercializing large-area OLED displays for use in televisions. We believe that if these efforts are successful, they could result in sizeable markets for OLED displays. 2 Organic materials make technically possible the development of flexible displays for use in an entirely new array of product applications. Such applications include display devices that fold in use, or conform to various shapes for wearable, rollable, industrial and ruggedized applications. In addition, due to the inherent transparency of the organic materials and transparent electrode technologies, OLEDs eventually may enable the production of transparent displays for use in products such as automotive windshields and windows with embedded displays. The Solid-State Lighting Market Traditional incandescent light bulbs are inefficient because they convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into visible light, with the rest emerging as heat. Fluorescent lamps use excited gases, or plasmas, to achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of about 20%. However, the color rendering index of most fluorescent lamps – in other words, the quality of their color compared to an ideal light source – is inferior to that of an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent lamps also pose environmental concerns because they typically contain mercury. Solid-state lighting relies on the direct conversion of electricity to visible light using semiconductor materials. By avoiding the heat and plasma-producing processes of incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, respectively, solid-state lighting products can have substantially higher energy conversion efficiencies. There are currently two basic types of solid-state lighting devices: inorganic light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and OLEDs. Current LEDs are very small in size (about one square millimeter) and are extremely bright. Having been developed about 25 years before OLEDs, LEDs are already widely employed in a variety of lighting products, such as traffic lights, digital signage and billboards, replacements for incandescent lighting, backlights for smartphones, computer monitors and televisions, and as border or accent lighting. However, most commercial LED offerings are characterized by high operating temperatures and intense brightness which may make them less desirable for many lighting applications. OLEDs, on the other hand, can be designed to provide improved lighting characteristics because they can be larger in size and can be viewed directly, without using diffusers that are required to temper the intense brightness of LEDs. OLEDs can be fabricated onto any suitable surface, including glass, plastic or metal foil, and could be cost-effective to manufacture in high volume. Given these characteristics, product manufacturers are working on and have introduced limited product applications of OLEDs for diffuse specialty lighting applications and ultimately general illumination. If these efforts are successful, we believe that OLED lighting products could begin to be used for applications currently addressed by other existing lighting technologies, as well as for new applications that take advantage of the OLED form factor. In particular, the ability of OLED technology to produce uniform illumination over arbitrary shapes is making OLED lighting very attractive to the automobile industry as well as the digital signage industry. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we currently are one of the leading technology developers in the OLED industry because we were the first company to develop and commercialize PHOLED emitter technology. Our experienced management and research teams have built an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our OLED technologies and materials, particularly with regard to PHOLED emitter materials, which we continually seek to enhance and grow. We work diligently, through the delivery of high-quality commercial products, superior technical support and customer service, to enable our industry-leading customers, which primarily are large display manufacturers, to adopt our OLED technologies and materials through implementation of long-term commercial material supply and patent and know-how license agreements. Our key competitive strengths include: Technology Leadership We are a recognized technology leader in the OLED industry. We, along with world-class academic partners, pioneered the development of our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technologies, which can be used to produce OLEDs that are up to four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs, which are illuminated using backlights. We believe that our PHOLED technologies and materials will continue to be well-suited for industry usage in the commercial production of OLED displays and lighting products. Through our internal, innovative research, which has produced the majority of our most critical commercial technologies, our relationships with supplier companies, such as PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and our existing and new academic partners, we believe that we can continue to advance the technology we have already developed and commercialized, and that we will continue to discover and develop other important OLED technologies, as well as novel OLED materials, that will facilitate further adoption of our various OLED technologies by product manufacturers. To this end, we operate two state-of-the-art laboratories, or Application Centers, near our larger customers in the Asia-Pacific region. These Application Centers have provided us and our customers with the ability to more quickly evaluate, develop and bring to market our newest OLED materials and technologies. We also are committing significant resources to 3 further the development of next-generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as organic vapor jet printing (OVJP). Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property Generally, each of our commercial offerings is protected by multiple patents which can help us either to prevent or combat the introduction of counterfeit and/or knock-off products that could potentially impact the market demand for our OLED materials and technologies. Our strong patent and non-patented know-how portfolios in the areas of PHOLED emitter materials, complementary PHOLED materials, OLED device designs, and OLED manufacturing technologies are reflective of our continued commitment to innovate and invest. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the OLED industry. Through our internal development efforts, acquisitions, and long-standing relationships with academic partners, research institutions and product manufacturers, we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. We continue to enhance and grow our OLED technology and materials patent portfolio organically through internal research and development, partnering with third parties, and by acquisition. We also continue to accumulate valuable non-patented technical know-how relating to our OLED technologies and materials. Leading Supplier of UniversalPHOLED® Emitter Materials and Related Technology Licensing We are the leading supplier of PHOLED emitter materials to OLED device manufacturers. The emitter material, which is designed to efficiently convert electrical energy to a desired wavelength of light, is the key component in an OLED device. Our manufacturing partner of over 20 years, PPG, continues to manufacture our materials for us, using proprietary manufacturing processes and know-how, which materials we then qualify to our exacting product specifications and resell on a just-in-time basis to OLED device manufacturers. We record revenues based on our sales of these materials to OLED device manufacturers. Our commercial supply agreements typically require our customers to purchase minimum quantities of our materials, which purchases can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or as a minimum percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. Our commercial supply arrangements allow us to maintain close technical and business relationships with these OLED device manufacturers purchasing our proprietary materials, and thereby further supports our technology licensing business. We do not directly manufacture or sell OLED display or lighting products. Instead, we enter into non-exclusive licensing arrangements with OLED device manufacturers, many of which also purchase our materials, that pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties based on their sales of licensed commercial products using our proprietary technology and patents. We believe this business model allows us to concentrate on our core strengths of technology development and innovation, while at the same time provides significant operating leverage. We also believe that this approach may reduce potential competitive conflicts with our customers. Long-Standing Customer Relationships We have long-standing customer relationships with OLED device manufacturers that are using, or are evaluating for use, our OLED materials in commercial OLED products. We have more than 20 years of experience in working closely with OLED device manufacturers and have provided support to them in their commercialization of OLED technology by delivering customer-specific solutions for red, green, and yellow emitter materials, or dopants. We have a proven track record of delivering consistent, high-quality OLED material to our customers. We provide just-in-time supply to our customers and serve as a sole source to them for many of our critical materials. We believe that our unparalleled manufacturing partners, namely PPG, our well-established supply chain, our multi-tier quality testing, and our product assurance protocols make us a preferred partner for our customers and for any large-scale OLED display manufacturer that wants to deliver to high-quality international end-customers. In 2021, our largest customers for our PHOLED materials included Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE), Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma), Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox), Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT), Shenzhen Royale Display Technologies Co. Ltd., Japan Display, Inc., Sharp Corporation, and AU Optronics Corporation (AU Optronics). Other licensed customers of our technology in 2021 included Kaneka Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and OLEDWorks L.L.C. Complementary UniversalPHOLED ® Host Material Business In addition to our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® emitter materials, we continue to develop, supply and offer for sale certain of our proprietary phosphorescent host materials to OLED device manufacturers. In addition, we have entered into a number of host 4 material strategic partnerships through development agreements with OLED material partners that are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in order to optimize the performance of our emitters in our customers’ newest product designs. We do not believe that revenue from our host development and third-party collaboration agreements will be significant compared with our emitter business. However, we believe that development and collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring the continued success of the OLED industry and the broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies in the marketplace. Experienced Management and Scientific Advisory Team Our management team has significant experience in developing business models focused on licensing disruptive technologies in high growth industries. The team has strong relationships with, and deep understandings of, our customers and their needs, the commercial marketplace and the OLED industry on the whole. We believe our management team’s experience and long-standing relationships are important to maintaining good and accommodating working relationships with our customers, particularly when we are confronted with challenging technical, regulatory and trade issues given our international reach. In addition, we employ and contract with some of the leading researchers in the industry, and we maintain a long-standing Scientific Advisory Board that includes industry pioneers, namely Professor Stephen R. Forrest of the University of Michigan (Michigan) and Professor Mark E. Thompson of the University of Southern California (USC). Our Business Strategy Our current business strategy is to continue to promote and expand our portfolio of OLED technologies and materials for widespread use in OLED displays and lighting products. We generate revenues primarily by selling our proprietary OLED materials and licensing our OLED technologies to display and lighting product manufacturers. We are presently focused on the following steps to implement our business strategy: Expand Our Collaborative Relationships with Leading Product Manufacturers and Developers We collaborate and partner with leading manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are commercial licensees of our OLED technologies and purchasers of our OLED materials. We also supply our proprietary OLED materials to manufacturers and developers of OLED displays and lighting products for evaluation and for use in product development and for pre-commercial activities, and we provide technical assistance and support to these manufacturers and developers to foster ongoing relationships and new commercial agreements. We concentrate on working closely with OLED device manufacturers and developers because we believe that the successful incorporation of our technologies and materials into commercial products is critical to their widespread adoption. Enhance Our Existing Portfolio of PHOLED Technologies and Materials We believe that a strong portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products is critical to our continued success, particularly as the utilization of PHOLED technologies and materials expands in the marketplace. Consequently, we are continually seeking to expand this portfolio through our internal development efforts, our collaborative relationships with existing and new academic and other research partners, and other strategic opportunities, such as funding early-stage startup companies whose technology may be synergistic to ours. Since the acquisition of the early fundamental research developed by our initial academic partners in the late 1990’s, one of our primary goals has been and continues to be the development of new and improved PHOLED technologies and materials with increased efficiencies, enhanced color gamut and extended lifetimes, which are compatible with different manufacturing methods, so that they can be used by various manufacturers in a broad array of OLED display and lighting products. Develop Next-Generation Organic Technologies We continue to conduct research and development activities relating to next-generation OLED technologies for both displays and lighting products, including next generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as OVJP, which we discuss in more detail below. We also are funding research by existing and new academic partners and research institutions on the use of OLED related technologies in other applications. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to enable us to maintain our position as a leading provider of OLED and other organic electronics technologies and materials as new markets emerge. 5 Business and Geographic Markets We derive revenue from the following: Most manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are or might potentially be interested in our OLED technologies and materials are currently located outside of the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide on-the-ground support to these manufacturers, we have established wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong, as well as a representative office in Taiwan. In 2019, we also completed the construction of new Application Centers in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea, which allow our Asia-based display manufacturers to evaluate our technology more quickly and incorporate the technology into their commercial designs. Our wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, UDC Ireland Ltd. (UDC Ireland), is responsible for all material sales worldwide (excluding the United States) and for licensing and managing intellectual property and undertaking certain other business transactions in all non-U.S. territories. In 2021, we received a majority of our revenue from three customers domiciled in the Asia-Pacific region, BOE, LG Display and SDC, each of which had revenue in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenue. Our business is heavily dependent on our relationships with these customers. Substantially all revenue derived from our customers is denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally enter into long-term agreements with our customers, which may include (1) a commercial supply agreement for the purchase of specific OLED materials, and (2) patent and know-how license agreements that relate to the manufacture of display and lighting devices. Generally, our commercial material supply agreements provide for multi-year purchase commitments, typically on a price per gram basis, which entitle our customers to certain discounts, technical support on the use of our OLED materials in mass production facilities, and access to certain future OLED materials. In order to secure preferential pricing and technology access, a customer typically agrees to certain minimum purchase obligations which can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or a percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. If a customer does not meet its minimum purchase obligations, generally we would have the right to review pricing for future material sales and impose other financial penalties. Our patent and know-how license agreements generally are made available to our customers for the manufacture of OLED devices. In addition, we also may license to certain material company partners the right to manufacture certain OLED materials that are complementary to our phosphorescent emitter materials. These licenses have included licenses to make host products and certain other non-phosphorescent materials. We believe it is in our, and our customers’ best interests to facilitate the development of materials that are complementary to our offerings and which assist our customers to produce more efficient and manufacturable devices with our materials. These collaboration efforts are likely to generate additional licensing fees for us under our license agreements. Although our customers generally pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties for OLED licensed products that they manufacture, our material partner licensees generally pay us a portion of their sales for materials that are developed under material collaboration agreements and subsequently commercialized. To date, these material collaboration arrangements have not generated significant revenues for us. For more information on our revenues, costs and expenses associated with our business, as well as a breakdown of revenues from North America and foreign sources, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included elsewhere in this report. Our Technology and its Relation to OLED Technology and Structure OLED devices are solid-state semiconductor devices made from thin films of organic material that emit light of various wavelengths when electricity is selectively applied to the emissive layer of the device. OLED devices are typically referred to as incorporating an “OLED stack.” OLED stacks vary in specific structure but those commonly used today may include a cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, an emissive layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer and an anode, all of which are placed on a substrate which may be made of a number of different materials, including glass, plastic and metal. Our technology and materials are most commonly utilized in the emissive layer; the materials in the emissive layer are the light-generating component of the OLED stack. Many of our key technologies relate primarily to phosphorescent emitter materials, which we believe are more energy efficient than fluorescent emitter materials that can also be used to generate light within the emissive layer of 6 the OLED device. We began selling emitter materials commercially in 2003. A manufacturer will use a small amount of emitter material for each device through a process called “doping” into a host material. The emitter material(s) and the host material(s) together form an emissive layer system. Depending on the nature of the OLED device, the emissive materials and emissive layer system may be designed to emit different colors. We have commercially produced and sold phosphorescent emitter materials that produce red, yellow, green and light-blue light, which are combined in various ways for the display and lighting markets. Our current materials business, conducted outside the United States by UDC Ireland, is focused primarily on the delivery of such emissive materials. We have also developed host materials for the emissive layer and began selling them commercially in 2011. In addition to our materials, which are generally protected by patents covering various molecular structures, we also have system and process patents that cover various fundamentally important aspects of the OLED device, device architectures, use of materials in devices and OLED manufacturing processes. These patents are important to our licensing business because they enable us to provide our business partners important OLED related technologies. Our PHOLED Technologies PHOLED technologies utilize specialized materials and device structures that allow OLEDs to emit light through a process known as phosphorescence. Traditional fluorescent OLEDs emit light through an inherently less efficient process. Theory and experiment show that PHOLEDs exhibit device efficiencies up to four times higher than those exhibited by fluorescent OLEDs. Phosphorescence substantially reduces the power requirements of an OLED and is useful in displays for hand-held devices, such as smartphones, where battery power is often a limiting factor. Phosphorescence is also important for large-area displays such as televisions, where higher device efficiency and lower heat generation may enable longer product lifetimes and increased energy efficiency. We have a strong intellectual property portfolio surrounding our existing PHOLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products which we market under the UniversalPHOLED® brand. We devote a substantial portion of our efforts to developing new and improved proprietary PHOLED materials and device architectures for red, green, yellow, blue and white OLED devices. In 2021, we continued our commercial supply relationships with companies such as BOE, LG Display, SDC, Tianma, CSOT and Visionox to use our PHOLED materials to manufacture OLED displays. In addition, we have worked and continue to work closely with customers evaluating and qualifying our proprietary PHOLED materials for commercial usage in both displays and lighting products, and with other material suppliers to combine our PHOLED emitters with their phosphorescent hosts and other OLED materials. Our Additional Proprietary OLED Technologies Our intellectual property, research, development and commercialization efforts also encompass a number of other OLED device and manufacturing technologies, including, but not limited to, the following: FOLED  Flexible OLEDs We are working on a number of technologies required for the fabrication of OLEDs on flexible substrates. Most other flat panel displays are built on rigid glass substrates. In contrast, FOLEDs are OLEDs built on non-rigid substrates such as plastic or metal foil. This has the potential to enhance durability and enable conformation to certain shapes or repeated bending or flexing. Many OLED smartphone displays are built on plastic substrates including those produced by SDC and LG Display. Several of our customers demonstrated different foldable and rollable FOLED displays at the 2021 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas, NV. The commercial introduction of such FOLED product offerings demonstrates the viability of new display product applications, such as portable, roll-up communications televisions, tablets, notebook computers and smartphones, as well as enhance the usefulness of such devices in ruggedized, industrial and wearable computing systems. Manufacturers also may be able to produce FOLEDs using more efficient continuous, or roll-to-roll, processing methods in the future. Our internal research and development efforts are expected to enhance and promote the future adoption of consumer and industrial FOLED devices. OVJP® Organic Vapor Jet Printing OLEDs could be manufactured using other processes as well, including OVJP. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask ( i.e. , the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. In 2019, we installed a new red-green-blue OVJP pilot tool at our Ewing, New Jersey facility, and we continue to collaborate on OVJP technology development with Professor Forrest of Michigan. In June 2020, a wholly-owned 7 subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based in California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary OVJP technology. As of December 31, 2021, OVJP employed a team of 25 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. Our Strategic Relationships with Product Manufacturers We have established early-stage evaluation programs, development and pre-commercial programs, and commercial arrangements with a substantial number of manufacturers or potential manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products. Many of these relationships are directed towards tailoring our proprietary OLED technologies and materials for use by individual manufacturers. Our ultimate objective is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to these manufacturers for their commercial production of OLED products. Relationships with OLED Display Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to display manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. We have been collaborating with some of these display manufacturers for over 20 years. We have been working with SDC and providing our PHOLED materials to SDC for evaluation since 2001. Under the terms of a 2011 patent license agreement, we licensed our patents and technologies to SDC for its manufacture and sale of AMOLED display products. Under the terms of a 2011 supplemental purchase agreement, we supplied our proprietary PHOLED materials to SDC for its use in manufacturing licensed products. We also continue to supply SDC with our proprietary UniversalPHOLED materials for use in its development efforts under a 2001 joint development agreement. The 2011 license and purchase agreements with SDC expired on December 31, 2017, and on February 13, 2018, we entered into new patent license and supplemental purchase agreements, both with an effective date of January 1, 2018. These agreements, which cover the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, last through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under these agreements, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. These agreements convey to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. The 2018 supplemental purchase agreement provides for minimum annual purchase obligations of phosphorescent emitter material from us for use in the manufacture of licensed products. The minimum commitment is subject to SDC's requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. SDC is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for smartphones and other personal electronic devices and produces displays for a number of different smartphone and electronic device manufacturers. We have been working with LG Display and its affiliates for over 15 years. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license agreement calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, we entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. LG Display is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for large-area televisions and produces display panels for a number of different television manufacturers. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma. Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. 8 In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE. Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox. Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox's affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with CSOT. In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in licensed products. We have been collaborating with AU Optronics since 2001, and we continue to provide our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics under a 2016 commercial supply agreement through which AU Optronics also has certain license rights. We also continue to support numerous display manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, through evaluation arrangements in which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for limited scale commercial production, evaluation and for purposes of development, manufacturing qualification and product testing. Many of these strategic relationships have been in place for longer than a decade, and we continue to establish new relationships. Relationships with OLED Lighting Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to lighting manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. Many of these strategic relationships have also been in place for longer than a decade. Since 2004, we have been supporting Konica Minolta in its efforts to develop OLED lighting products. We continue to license our patents and technology to Konica Minolta under a 2008 OLED technology license agreement for its manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products that utilize our phosphorescent and other OLED technologies. We also continue to provide Konica Minolta with our proprietary PHOLED materials for its manufacture of commercial OLED lighting products under a 2011 commercial material supply agreement, and for evaluation purposes under a 2012 evaluation agreement. We also continue to license our OLED patents to Sumitomo under a 2015 OLED patent portfolio license agreement in which we granted Sumitomo a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing license to make and sell OLED lighting panels using a solution-based manufacturing process. Under the license agreement, Sumitomo may also purchase certain of our phosphorescent materials. We continue to license our OLED patents, and to provide our OLED materials, to OLEDWorks for use in OLED lighting products under patent license and commercial supply agreements signed in 2015. We have also extended the rights under these agreements to OLEDWorks GmbH, the German company and facility that OLEDWorks acquired in 2015 from Philips Technologie GmbH. We continue to license our technologies and patents to Kaneka for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products, under the terms of a 2013 license agreement, and we continue to supply our materials to Kaneka under a 2014 commercial material supply agreement. We also have a license agreement for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products with Pioneer, among others. Similar to our arrangements with display manufacturers, we continue to support numerous lighting manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, typically through evaluation agreements under which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for evaluation and potential commercial application. Relationships with Manufacturers for Other Commercial Products In addition to our relationships with lighting and display manufacturers, we have agreements and arrangements with manufacturers or potential manufacturers to use our proprietary OLED technologies and materials in other commercial products, such as in automotive interiors and exteriors. 9 Our OLED Materials Manufacturing Business We supply our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® materials to display manufacturers, lighting manufacturers and others. These materials are produced in batch quantities by PPG to our exacting product specifications using our manufacturing process and know-how. We qualify each batch of emitters at our device qualification facilities to ensure that they meet required specifications, and we store qualified product inventory for delivery to our customers. We believe that our inventory-carrying practices, along with the terms under which we sell our OLED materials (including payment terms), are typical for the markets in which we operate. In 2021, our OLED materials business received recertification in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems. In 2021, UDC’s Ewing, NJ facility also received certification in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems. In 2021, UDC’s Ewing, NJ facility received certification in accordance with ISO 45001:2018 Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems. PPG We have maintained a close working relationship with PPG since 2000. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with PPG, the term of which, by amendment in February 2021, continues through December 31, 2024 and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Under that agreement, PPG is responsible, under our direction, for manufacturing scale-up of our proprietary OLED materials, and for supplying us with those materials. We use these materials for our own research and development as well as for resale to our customers, both for their evaluation and for use in commercial OLED products. Through our collaboration with PPG, key raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis. We have not had any issues with obtaining access to adequate amounts of any key raw materials. In February 2021, we entered into an amendment to the PPG agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland at our new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM), for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory improvements are expected to be completed and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. As with the initial agreement with PPG, we will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. Collaborations with Other OLED Material Manufacturers We continued our non-exclusive collaborative relationships with OLED material manufacturing customers during 2021. Most of these relationships are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in an effort to optimize our PHOLED emitter products and deliver a high-performance system to the end customer. Our product manufacturing customers are not required to purchase host materials from us. As a result, we do not believe these collaboration efforts will generate significant revenue for us as compared to our emitter and licensing businesses. We believe, however, that collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring success of the OLED industry and broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies. Research and Development Our research and development activities are focused on the advancement of our OLED technologies and materials for displays, lighting and other applications. We conduct this research and development primarily internally and also through various relationships with commercial business partners, academic partners, and research institutions. Our venture capital company, UDC Ventures LLC, continues to seek to invest in companies that we believe are developing synergistic or complementary technologies to ours. Internal Development Efforts Ewing, New Jersey Facility We conduct a substantial portion of our OLED development activities at our state-of-the-art development and testing facility in Ewing, New Jersey. At this expanded facility, which now exceeds 50,000 square feet, we perform technology development, including device and process optimization, prototype fabrication, manufacturing scale-up studies, process and product testing, characterization and reliability studies, and technology transfer with our business partners. Our Ewing facility houses multiple OLED deposition systems, including a full-color flexible OLED system and an OVJP system. In addition, the facility contains equipment for substrate patterning, organic material deposition, display packaging, module assembly and extensive testing in Class 100 and 100,000 clean rooms and opto-electronic test laboratories. Our facility also includes state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical chemistry laboratories in which we conduct OLED materials research and make small quantities of new materials that we then test in OLED devices. 10 Application Centers In addition to our laboratory facilities in Ewing, New Jersey, in 2019 we completed the construction of new, leased, Application Centers in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea. These centers, which include state-of-the-art OLED laboratories, better assist our Asia-based customers in their timely evaluation and adoption of our proprietary PHOLED materials, know-how and technologies in their respective PHOLED designs. Our Contract Research Organization Business: Adesis, Inc. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis). Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. Adesis currently operates in its headquarters facility, which it purchased in 2017 and consists of over 47,500 square feet in New Castle, Delaware and another, leased, over 30,700 square foot facility in Wilmington, Delaware. As of December 31, 2021, Adesis employed a team of 135 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Although we expect to continue to utilize the majority of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, Adesis is expected to continue operating as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries. University-Sponsored Research Original Academic Partners We have long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and USC for the conduct of research relating to our OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials for applications such as displays and lighting. This research, subject to an agreement entered into by the parties (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), generated many of the original fundamental PHOLED concepts and underlying patents that we commercialized, and had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Thompson. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan, where we continue to fund his research. Since 2006, in connection with Dr. Forrest’s transfer, we entered into a new sponsored research agreement with USC under which we are funding organic electronics research being conducted by Drs. Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years. We make payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2021, we were obligated to pay USC up to $4.3 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. Other Academic Relationships We entered into a contract research agreement with the Chitose Institute of Science and Technology of Japan (CIST) in 2004. Under that agreement, we funded a research program headed by Professor Chihaya Adachi relating to high-efficiency OLED materials and devices. We were granted exclusive rights to all intellectual property developed under this program. Our relationship with CIST ended in 2006 when Professor Adachi transferred to Kyushu University. However, we have continued our relationship with Professor Adachi under a separate consulting arrangement. In 2006 and 2007, we entered into one-year research agreements with Kyung Hee University to sponsor research programs on flexible, amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology. The programs were directed by Professor Jin Jang. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into contract research agreements with Silicon Display Technology, Ltd. (SDT), a company founded by Professor Jang, and in 2013, we entered into another one-year agreement with SDT. We continue to maintain a good working relationship with Professor Jang. Over the years, we have also entered into research agreements with various universities and research institutions that have been able to provide tailored research capabilities and insights relating to our PHOLED technology. As the utilization of PHOLED technology continues to expand, we intend to further engage key researchers at other universities and research institutions to help identify additional fundamental technologies that could benefit PHOLED technology implementation. U.S. Government-Funded Research In the past, we have entered into U.S. government contracts and subcontracts to fund a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation OLED technologies concentrated primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. On contracts for which we were the prime contractor, we subcontracted portions of the work to various entities and institutions. All of the U.S. government contracts and 11 subcontracts that we have entered into were subject to termination at the election of the contracting governmental agency. We do not believe that any of these U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Intellectual Property Along with our personnel, our primary and most fundamental assets are patents and other intellectual property. This includes more than 5,500 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense. It also includes a substantial body of non-patented technical know-how that we have accumulated over time. Our Patents Our research and development activities, conducted both internally and through collaborative programs with third parties, have resulted in our filing of a substantial number of patent applications relating to our OLED technologies and materials. These patents that we own represent, among other things, innovations beyond the original fundamental PHOLED conceptual patents that we license from our university research partners, described below. Although many of these licensed fundamental conceptual patents have expired, our internal research efforts include essential innovations that have generated commercially viable implementations of the original PHOLED concepts and patents. As of December 31, 2021, we owned more than 5,000 unexpired issued patents and pending patent applications around the world in addition to the hundreds of patents and patent applications we exclusively license from our research partners, as discussed below. Patents We License from Research Partners We exclusively license patent rights from a number of university research partners. Generally, we sponsor scientific researchers at universities to undertake pre-defined research programs, and in exchange we receive license rights to patents that may be developed under the programs. As part of these programs, we may provide compensation in the form of support for research program-related activities, reimbursement for patent related costs, as well as providing for some forms of licensing and/or sublicensing fees for licensed technology that is commercialized by us or our customers. We have expanded our sponsored research programs over the past 10 years to include additional scientific researchers at a number of different institutions that we believe can provide breakthroughs in promising new fields of research that may benefit the OLED marketplace. As of December 31, 2021, the patent rights we exclusively license from all our university research partners included more than 650 issued patents and pending patent applications in jurisdictions around the world. Under our university patent license agreements, we are generally free to sublicense to third parties all or any portion of the licensed patent rights for the life of the licensed patents, though our rights are subject to termination for an uncured material breach or default by us, or if we become bankrupt or insolvent. As part of our university license agreements, we may be required to compensate the universities to the extent we, or our sublicensees, utilize the licensed technology in commercial products. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement we are required to pay Princeton royalties for licensed products sold by us or our sublicensees. These royalties amount to 3% of the net sales price for licensed products sold by us and 3% of the revenues we receive for licensed patents used by our sublicensees. Princeton shares portions of these royalties with USC and Michigan under their inter-institutional agreements. We owed royalties under the 1997 Amended License Agreement with Princeton of $691,000 for 2021. Acquired Patents and Other Intellectual Property From time to time we acquire patents and other intellectual property that we believe provide strategic business opportunities, such as the patent and technology portfolio we acquired from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Motorola, Inc.) (Motorola) in 2011, and the following portfolios from Fujifilm Corporation and BASF: Patents We Acquired from Fujifilm Corporation In 2012, we entered into a Patent Sale Agreement (the Fujifilm Agreement) with Fujifilm. Under the Fujifilm Agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $109.5 million. The Fujifilm Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The Fujifilm Agreement permitted us to assign all of our rights and obligations under the Fujifilm Agreement to our affiliates, and we assigned, prior 12 to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement, our rights and obligations to UDC Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. Patents We Acquired from BASF In 2016, UDC Ireland entered into an IP Transfer Agreement (the BASF Agreement) with BASF. Under the BASF Agreement, BASF sold us more than 500 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $96.0 million. The transactions contemplated by the BASF Agreement were consummated on June 28, 2016. Intellectual Property Developed under Our Government Contracts We and our subcontractors have developed, and may continue to develop, patentable OLED technology inventions under our various U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. Under these arrangements, we or our subcontractors generally can elect to take title to any patents on these inventions, and to control the manner in which these patents are licensed to third parties. However, the U.S. government reserves rights to these inventions and associated technical data that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications, or to third parties for commercial applications. In addition, if the U.S. government determines that we or our subcontractors have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these inventions in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government may require that we or our subcontractors license these inventions to third parties in that field of use. We do not believe that our current U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Non-patented Technical Know-How We have accumulated, and continue to accumulate, a substantial amount of non-patented technical know-how relating to OLED technologies and materials. Where practicable, we share portions of this information with display manufacturers and other business partners on a confidential basis. We also employ various methods to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, although no such methods can afford complete protection. Moreover, because we derive some of this information and know-how from academic institutions, there is an increased potential for public disclosure. We also cannot prevent the actual independent development of the same or similar information and know-how by third parties. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against alternative display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as other OLED technologies. We also compete in the lighting market against incumbent technologies, such as incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, and inorganic LEDs, and against emerging technologies, such as other OLED technologies. Display Panel Industry Competitors Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing and improving LCD, which includes quantum dot LCDs (which are sometimes referred to as QLEDs), and other display technologies that compete with our OLED display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies can compete with LCDs, QLEDs and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video rates, form factor and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur. Lighting Industry Competitors Although there has been a movement to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs throughout many countries, traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps remain well-entrenched products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state LEDs have been introduced into the market and would compete with OLED lighting products. LEDs have realized significant market adoption in the general lighting market. Having attributes different from fluorescent lamps and LEDs, OLEDs may compete directly with these products for certain lighting applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might occur. OLED Technologies and Materials Competitors 13 Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) developed and patented the original fluorescent OLED technology in 1987. Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd. (CDT), which was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company in 2007, developed and patented polymer OLED technology in 1989. Display and lighting manufacturers, including customers of ours, are engaged in their own OLED research, development and commercialization activities, and have developed and may continue to develop proprietary OLED technologies that are necessary or useful for commercial OLED devices. In addition, other material manufacturers, such as Sumitomo, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (Idemitsu Kosan), Merck KGaA, Cynora Gmbh and Kyulux Inc., are selling or sampling competing OLED materials to customers, including companies to which we sell our proprietary PHOLED materials. Our licensing business is based on our control of a broad portfolio of OLED-related device patents and technologies. We believe this portfolio includes fundamental patents in the field of phosphorescent OLED materials and devices, as well as certain additional complementary OLED technologies. As discussed above, alternative technologies, such as fluorescent OLED emitter materials, exist and could be competitive to our phosphorescent OLED material solutions. However, fluorescent materials have characteristics that we believe many market participants consider less desirable than those of phosphorescent materials. Suppliers of fluorescent emitter materials include Doosan Solus, Dow Chemical (previously Gracel Display), Idemitsu Kosan and SFC Co. Ltd. Fluorescent materials may also be viewed as complementary in that they can be used in the same OLED stack as phosphorescent materials. The competitive landscape with respect to our host materials business is characterized by a larger number of established chemical material suppliers who have long-term relationships with many of our existing customers and licensees. We have elected to partner with certain of these companies to manufacture and deliver host solutions to our customers, as well as selling our host materials directly to device manufacturers. We believe our competitive advantage stems, in part, from our deep knowledge of our phosphorescent emitter materials, which are complementary with the host solutions. We believe that our understanding of phosphorescent emitter materials enables us to create host material solutions that are especially well suited for use with a certain class of emitter materials that are implemented commercially today. However, we note that many of our technology partners have their own host solutions and the competitive landscape includes many well-established companies such as Solus, Advanced Materials Co., Dow Chemical, Duksan Neolux Co., Ltd., Idemitsu Kosan, Merck KGaA, NSCC and Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. These companies have significant resources, and some may aggressively pursue such business in the future. Our existing business relationships with SDC and other product manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve a significant level of market penetration in the display and lighting industries. However, others, such as those working to develop thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and micro-LED alternative technologies, may succeed in developing new OLED technologies, materials and alternative solutions that may supplement or be utilized in place of ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers will adopt and continue to utilize our OLED technologies and materials for the production of commercial displays and lighting products. Our Venture Capital Business: UDC Ventures LLC We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UDC Ventures LLC, in March 2019, as a corporate venture capital entity that funds companies we believe are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic or complementary to our business and/or business strategies or which may otherwise provide favorable investment opportunities. Human Capital As of December 31, 2021, we had 409 active full-time employees and eight part-time employees, none of whom are unionized. Of these employees, 298 are research scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians at our domestic and international facilities. This team includes chemists, physicists, engineers and technicians with physics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and organic/inorganic chemistry backgrounds, and highly-trained theoreticians and experimentalists. We believe that relations with our employees are good. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. We have required our workforce to be vaccinated, and a significant majority of our office workers continue to work on a hybrid schedule. Within our production and office areas we have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements, enhanced cleaning, encouraging daily self-health checks, and mandatory temperature screening stations managed by health professionals. We have also implemented a coronavirus testing protocol in certain of our offices where the incidence of COVID outbreaks may impact critical operations. As part of that reporting process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify employees who were in close contact with any ill employee in the workplace. All of the actions above are overseen by a Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of our COVID-19 response. 14 Our goal is to be a diverse and inclusive company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. Women represent 33% of our executive management team, 22% of our leadership (Director level and above) and 23% of our total workforce, as well as 33% of our Board of Directors. We have employees from over 25 countries in our workforce, and we believe that a diverse workforce made up of people with different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds drives employee and business success. In 2021 our voluntary turnover rate was 11%, and we had overall employee growth rate of 16%. Additional data, including historical turnover and diversity information, as well as our corporate policies relating to our employee engagement and human capital, are updated on our website www.oled.com, and included in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Company History Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1985. Our business was commenced in 1994 by a company then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. functions as an operating subsidiary of ours and has certain overlapping officers and directors. We have also formed or acquired other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited (2008), Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (2010), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK (2011), UDC Ireland Limited (2012), Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. (2016), Adesis, Inc. (2016), UDC Ventures LLC (2019), OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (2020), and OVJP Corporation (2020), and we established a representative office in Taiwan (2011).

R ISK FACTORS 16 You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property If we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property protection for our OLED technologies and materials, our business will suffer. The value of our OLED technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. Although we own or license many patents respecting our OLED technologies and materials that have already been issued, there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained, or that any of these patents, once issued, will afford commercially significant protection for our OLED technologies and materials, or will be found valid if challenged. Also, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending the validity of our current or future patents in pending and future patent oppositions, invalidation trials, interferences, reexaminations, reissues, or other administrative or court proceedings. Moreover, we have not obtained patent protection for some of our OLED technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which OLED products or materials might be manufactured or sold. We believe that the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent OLED devices and certain materials utilized in these devices. Certain of our existing fundamental phosphorescent OLED patents expired in the United States in 2017 and 2019; and expired in other countries of the world in 2018 and 2020. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications relating to our commercial OLED materials and technologies whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend) beyond 2021, many of which are also of importance in the OLED industry, none may be of an equally essential nature as our original fundamental patents, and therefore our competitive position may be less certain as a result of the expiration of these patents. We have more than 5,500 issued and pending patents relating to our OLED technologies. There is no assurance that these patents and applications will not be challenged prior to their respective expirations in any of the jurisdictions in which they are utilized, or that if challenged, we will be able to secure sufficient breadth of protection, and monetary and injunctive relief for the violation of our rights to make up for the business harm resulting from such activities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or produce competing PHOLED material designs that may be outside of our existing patents. There may also be fundamental new advancements in the field of OLED technology that could enable the commercial use of older and unpatented PHOLED materials or the adoption of new OLED materials that do not require the utilization of our proprietary PHOLED materials to achieve superior performance characteristics. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees. In addition, we are participating in or have participated in, and in the future will likely have to participate in, interference, reissue, or reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and opposition, nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices, with respect to some of our patents or patent applications. All of these actions place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention from our business and operations. Moreover, if successful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key OLED technologies and materials on which our business depends. We rely, in part, on several non-patented proprietary technologies to operate our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Furthermore, these parties may obtain patent protection for such technology, inhibiting or preventing us from practicing the technology. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other non-patented proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other non-patented proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. Additionally, although we take many measures and implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, including by theft and misuse, of our intellectual property and proprietary information, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, reverse-engineer, use or disclose, illegally or otherwise, such intellectual property and proprietary information. We also may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems or to our intellectual property, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company or its products. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and proprietary information, it will harm our business. 17 We or our customers may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights or with respect to our OLED materials business. There are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials, including, without limitation, Kodak (substantially all of whose OLED assets were sold to a group of LG companies in 2009), CDT (acquired by Sumitomo in 2007), Canon, Inc., Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co., Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In addition, some of our customers such as SDC and LG Display have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials. As a result, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our OLED technologies or materials, thus subjecting our customers to possible suits for patent infringement in the future. Such lawsuits could result in our customers being liable for damages or require our customers to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ sales and thus our royalties or material sales revenues, or cause our customers to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates or pricing. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify customers purchasing our OLED materials for commercial usage against certain claims of patent infringement by third parties, as a result of which we may incur substantial legal costs in connection with defending these customers from such claims. Our licensees may also seek to avoid paying future royalties by attempting to have our patents declared invalid and unenforceable by a court. Our licensees may be more likely to file such declaratory actions in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc . (2007), in which the Court found that a licensee need not refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before bringing an action to declare a licensed U. S. patent invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we may be required, from time-to-time, to assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence. Defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable. Thus, any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable. If a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents, that party and others could compete more effectively against us. Our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents would also be adversely affected. Whether our customers are defending the assertion of third-party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology, or we are asserting our own intellectual property rights against others, such litigation can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to our or our customers’ business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. As a result, the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our customers are subject could disrupt business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our customers to significant liabilities, each of which could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials continue to enter the consumer marketplace. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages. Any intellectual property litigation commenced against our customers may force them to take actions that could be harmful to their businesses and thus to revenues, including the halting of sales of products that incorporate or otherwise use our technology or materials. Furthermore, the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex and is often subjective or uncertain. If our customers were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party, the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict. Decreased sales of our customers’ products incorporating our technology or materials would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses and material sales under our existing sales agreements. Were this to occur, it would likely harm our ability to (i) obtain new licensees which would have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees, and (ii) sell our UniversalPHOLED® materials to existing and new customers. Moreover, to the extent any third party claims are directed specifically to materials supplied by us to our customers, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with the defense of such claims and potential damages associated with such claims that may be awarded against our customers. As is commonplace in technology companies, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. To the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. The costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our customers’ businesses could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail. Recent court decisions in various patent cases may make it more difficult for us to obtain future patents, enforce our patents against third parties or obtain favorable judgments in cases where the patents are enforced. 18 Recent case law may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents. For example, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc . (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court mandated a more expansive and flexible approach to determine whether a patent is obvious and invalid. As a result of the less rigid approach to assessing obviousness, defending the validity of or obtaining patents may be more difficult. Recent court decisions may also impact the enforcement of our patents. For example, we may not be able to enjoin certain third party uses of products or methods covered by our patents following the initial authorized sale, even where those uses are expressly proscribed in an agreement with the buyer. Also, we may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement of our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an injunction should not automatically issue based on a finding of patent infringement, but should be determined based on a test balancing considerations of the patentee’s interest, the infringer’s interest, and the public’s interest. Obtaining enhanced damages for willful infringement of our patents may also be more difficult even in those cases where we successfully prove a third party has infringed our patents, as a recent case set a more stringent standard for proving willful infringement. Therefore, as a result of such rulings, it may be more difficult for us to defend our currently issued patents, obtain additional patents in the future or achieve the desired competitive effect even when our patents are enforced. If we are unable to so defend our currently issued patents, or to obtain new patents for any reason, our business would suffer. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations If we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with OLED product manufacturers, our business strategy will fail. Our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high-volume manufacturers of OLED products. We have entered into a limited number of such relationships from which most of our material sales and licensing revenue are generated. Our other relationships with product manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial products. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the product manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us. Many of our agreements with product manufacturers last for only limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these manufacturers will expire unless they are renewed. These product manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis or may agree to do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we regularly continue working with product manufacturers after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with the various product manufacturers not continue or be renewed on less favorable terms, or if we are not able to identify other product manufacturers and enter into contracts with them, our business may materially suffer. Our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing relationships, may depend on our ability to make certain financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail. If we fail to continue to make advances in our OLED research and development activities, we might not succeed in continuing to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. Further advances in our OLED technologies and materials depend, in part, on the success of the research and development work we conduct, both alone and with our research partners. We cannot be certain that this work will yield additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete research and development of our OLED technologies and materials successfully, or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our OLED technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. Conflicts or other problems may arise with our customers or joint development partners, resulting in renegotiation, breach or termination of, or litigation related to, our agreements with them. This would adversely affect our revenues. 19 Conflicts or other problems could arise between us and our customers or joint development partners, some of which we have made strategic investments in, as to royalty rates, milestone payments or other commercial terms. Similarly, we may disagree with our customers or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non-commercial terms. If such a conflict were to arise, a customer or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely, and we might lose the royalty revenues, material sales revenues and other benefits of the agreement. Either we or the customer or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations, establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement. Such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management. If we were unsuccessful in such litigation, we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement, be liable for financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute. If our OLED technologies and materials are not feasible for broad-based product applications, we may not be able to continue to generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our main business strategy is to sell our OLED materials and license our OLED technologies to manufacturers for incorporation into the display and lighting products that they sell. Consequently, our success depends on the ability and willingness of manufacturers to continue to develop, manufacture and sell commercial products integrating our technologies and materials. Before product manufacturers will agree to expand the use of our OLED technologies and materials for wider scale commercial production, they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our OLED technologies and materials are feasible for broad-based product applications beyond current commercial application, such as smartphones, wearables and television displays. This, in turn, may require additional advances in our technologies and materials, as well as those of others, for applications in a number of areas, including, without limitation, advances with respect to the development of: We cannot be certain that these advances will occur, and hence our OLED technologies and materials may not be feasible for additional broad-based product applications and expansion. Even if our OLED materials and technologies are technically feasible, they may not be further adopted by product manufacturers for broad-based product applications. The potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us remain uncertain. Market acceptance of our OLED materials and technologies beyond current product offerings and sales volumes will depend, in part, upon these materials and technologies providing benefits comparable or superior to competing display and lighting technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers, and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers. Many current and potential customers for our OLED technologies utilize and have invested significant resources in competing technologies, and may, therefore, be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our OLED technologies. During the entire product development process for a new product, we face the risk that our materials or technologies will fail to meet the manufacturer’s technical, performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology. Even if we offer materials and technologies that are satisfactory to a product manufacturer, the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our materials or technologies. In addition, our agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials, and those customers may elect not to purchase our host materials. Mass production of new mass market OLED products will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment, components and materials, many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, there may be a number of other technologies that manufacturers need to utilize in conjunction with our OLED technologies in order to bring these new OLED products to the market. Thus, even if our OLED technologies are a viable alternative to competing approaches, if product manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components, materials and other technologies, they may not utilize our OLED technologies. 20 There are numerous potential alternatives to OLEDs, which may limit our ability to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. The display market is currently, and will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by displays based on LCD technology. Numerous companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs; additionally, other competing display technologies have been, or are being, developed. A similar situation exists in the solid-state lighting market, which is currently dominated by LED products. Advances in any of these various technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies in their field, either of which could limit the potential market for products utilizing our OLED technologies and materials. This, in turn, would cause product manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us, or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us. Other OLED technologies may be more successful or cost-effective than ours, which may limit the commercial adoption of our OLED technologies and materials. Our competitors have developed and continue to develop OLED technologies that differ from or compete with our OLED technologies. In particular, competing fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLED technology may become a viable alternative to our phosphorescent OLED technology. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new OLED technologies that may become more cost-effective or have fewer limitations than our OLED technologies. If our OLED technologies, and particularly our phosphorescent OLED technology, are unable to continue to capture a substantial portion of the OLED product market, our business strategy may fail. The consumer electronics industry experiences significant downturns from time to time, any of which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our OLED technologies and materials. Our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our customers to manufacture and sell products utilizing our technologies and materials, specifically our phosphorescent emitters and host materials, and the widespread acceptance of our customers’ products in the consumer marketplace. Any slowdown in the demand for our customers’ products or a decrease in our customers’ use of or demand for our materials would adversely affect our material sales and royalty revenues and thus our business. Our customers’ decrease in the use of or demand for our materials may depend on several factors, including pricing, availability, continued technical improvements and competitive product offerings. The markets for flat panel displays and lighting products are highly competitive. Success in the market for end-user products that may integrate our OLED technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our customers and us, including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end-user markets that our customers serve, as well as industry and general economic conditions. The markets that we hope to penetrate have experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Our business strategy is dependent on manufacturers building and selling products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for displays and solid-state lighting products could cause significant harm to our business. Our customers may develop new or more efficient manufacturing processes, which may adversely affect demand for our OLED materials. By developing enhanced material processing methods and more efficient manufacturing techniques, our customers who purchase our phosphorescent emitter and host materials could become more efficient in the utilization of our materials by developing designs that require less materials on a per square meter basis, or by modifying their manufacturing process to make more efficient use of our materials, which could limit or reduce the amount of materials they purchase from us. Thus, demand for our materials may not expand in proportion to the number of OLED related products manufactured by our customers, and may result in reduced demand for our materials and technologies relative to our customers' manufacture and sale of products made with such materials. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations and business. Any similar future epidemic or pandemic could also have such an effect. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial 21 performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including a hybrid work from home arrangement, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel . In the future, we may face closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers may reduce their operations, as demand for their products becomes negatively affected, which would adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, we would expect our financial results to be materially adversely impacted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a hybrid work from home policy for many of our corporate employees and have established other policies, such as vaccine requirements, for certain of our employees. One or more of these policies may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business, and have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Should there be in the future any similar epidemic or pandemic that harms the global economy in general, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience impacts to certain of our customers as a result of health epidemic or other outbreak occurring in one or more locations, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any downturn in U.S. or global economic conditions may have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been significant and sustained economic downturns in the U.S. and globally in the past. These downturns have placed pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had a material adverse effect on the demand for consumer electronic products. Similar downturns in the future may have a significant adverse effect on one or more of our licensees as an enterprise, which could result in those licensees reducing their efforts to commercialize products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Consumer demand and the condition of the display and lighting industries may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, epidemics and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the demand for our customers’ products, and thus our business. Many of our competitors have greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them. The display and solid-state lighting industries are characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and research capabilities than we do. Because of these differences, we may never be able to compete successfully in these markets or maintain any competitive advantages we are able to achieve over time. If we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow, our business might not succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical and managerial personnel, and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to these and our other employees. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key technical or managerial personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is intense. We might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail. 22 We rely solely on PPG to manufacture the OLED materials we use and sell to product manufacturers. Our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary OLED materials for our own use and for sale to product manufacturers. Our agreement with PPG provides us with a source for these materials for development, evaluation and commercial purposes. Our agreement with PPG currently runs through the end of 2024 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Our inability to continue obtaining these OLED materials from PPG or another source at cost-competitive prices and to continue obtaining these OLED materials in sufficient quantities to meet our product manufacturers' current and future demands and timetables would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cost of goods sold relating to sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers, as well as on our ability to perform future development work. Additionally, PPG manufactures our materials at its facilities based in the United States. As a result, such materials may be subject to tariffs or other barriers from or to countries where some of our product manufacturer customers have operations and to where we would need to ship product. We strive to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to accommodate our manufacturing customers. Inventory management relating to our material sales is complex, and excess inventory may harm our business and cause it to suffer. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels of our OLED materials to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As a just-in-time supplier to our customers, we carry sufficient inventory to accommodate their capacity requirements, sometimes without firm purchase commitments. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers to provide our materials to us exposes us to longer lead times than if we were a direct manufacturer, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively. Our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply and demand of their products by end-users, or the supply and demand of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them. Inventory management risks are heightened when our largest customers launch new products and retire existing products. At such times, these customers tend to change product designs and may introduce some of our new materials into new designs. The production of these materials requires us to purchase essential raw material and commence manufacturing well in advance of receiving firm customer orders for such materials. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of unanticipated changes in our customers’ manufacturing plans and designs. Unanticipated product cessation and product introduction delays or cancellation may cause us to order or produce excess or insufficient inventory. Excess inventory of our OLED materials is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and inventory write-downs. We are the sole source supplier for certain critical components used in OLED technologies, which subjects customers to risk if we are unable to meet the demand for such components. Our customers depend on us as the sole source for certain proprietary PHOLED materials used in manufacturing OLED products, which makes them susceptible to supply shortages if we are unable to meet their demand for such components. A potential customer could be hesitant to adopt OLED technology given the risks inherent in depending on a sole source for critical components and the inability to establish alternate supply relationships. If we are unable to supply the components needed by our existing customers in a timely manner, or if potential customers do not utilize OLED technology because of concerns about our ability to meet supply demands, our business may materially suffer. Because the vast majority of OLED product manufacturers are located in the Asia-Pacific region, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations. Many of our customers and prospective customers have a majority of their operations in countries other than the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and revenue outside the United States represents a majority of our total net revenue. We also have offices in various countries located outside of the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include, without limitation: 23 Any of these factors could impair our ability to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials, thereby harming our business. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. We rely on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. We are dependent on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit important data and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third-party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors, that could adversely affect our business. Natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or earthquakes, particularly in Asia-Pacific region, where many of our customers are located, or the occurrence of other unforeseen catastrophic events, such a fire or flood, could unfavorably affect our business and financial performance. Such events could unfavorably affect our customers in many ways, such as causing physical damage to one or more of their properties, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more plants, the disruption or cessation of manufacturing of product lines, and the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or demand for their products. A resulting by-product of such natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could be a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of or demand for our products. Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Tax Matters We may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose additional compliance costs and that could negatively impact our business. Changes in environmental laws or regulations of our products could result in higher operating and compliance expenses and limit the markets in which we can manufacture and to which we can export our products. Changes in environmental laws or regulations, including laws relating to manufacturing operations and export restrictions, also could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and an increase in raw materials costs, and could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. government has rights to intellectual property derived from our government-funded work that might prevent us from realizing the full benefits of our intellectual property portfolio. The U.S. government, through various government agencies, has provided and continues to provide funding to us and university research partners for work related to certain aspects of our OLED technologies. Because we have been provided with this funding, the government has rights to any intellectual property derived from this work that could restrict our ability to market OLED products to the government for military and other applications, or to license this intellectual property to third parties for commercial applications. Moreover, if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of this intellectual 24 property in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government could require us to license this intellectual property to other parties in that field of use. Any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain maximum value from our intellectual property portfolio. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and business operations, and adversely impact our shareholders. Occasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. Risks Related to Our Stock and Capitalization We may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business. Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We may require additional funding in the future for the research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs. When we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain more money when needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or depositary shares, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these shares will dilute our then-existing shareholders. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies, particularly other emerging-growth companies in the technology industry. Factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future: Our operating results may have significant period-to-period fluctuations, which would make it difficult to predict our future performance. Due to the current stage of commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, current geopolitical risks, the limited number of commercially successful consumer products utilizing our OLED technologies that customers have introduced in the marketplace, the relatively short product lifetimes of these consumer products, and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our customers must achieve for the widespread inclusion of our OLED technologies in consumer products such 25 as mobile phones, tablets, television displays and lighting products, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time. Among other factors affecting our period-to-period results, our license and technology development fees often consist of large one-time, annual, semi-annual or quarterly payments, which may result in significant fluctuations in our revenues. In addition, our reliance on a relatively small number of licensees with large volumes of consumer product sales makes our quarterly operating results subject to our licensees’ specific plans and the success of their specific product offerings. With respect to material sales, our sales are primarily dependent on purchases made by a relatively small number of customers. In addition to the other factors described above relating to our customers’ sales opportunities, our quarter-to-quarter sales may be materially impacted by our customers’ inventory management plans, which may vary substantially based on financial management considerations, changes in their product mix plans, modified material processing techniques and manufacturing line modifications. If, in some future period, our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price. Broad market, industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock. The price of our common stock could decrease if: We can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could: As of February 23, 2022, we have issued and outstanding 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of Sherwin I. Seligsohn, our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past, none of which are currently outstanding, and may do so again at any time in the future. Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In 2017, our Board of Directors began declaring quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have consistently paid since then and we intend to continue to pay in the future. However, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. There is no 26 guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which current shareholders purchased their shares. Our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including takeover attempts. Our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates and the adult children of Sherwin Seligsohn, beneficially own, as of February 23, 2022, approximately 7.9% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these individuals may, as a practical matter, be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. This concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLV ED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. P ROPERTIES Our corporate offices and research and development laboratories are located at 250, 300 and 375 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey. In 2004, we acquired the building and property at which the 375 Phillips Boulevard facility is located. During 2005, we conducted a two-stage expansion of our laboratory and office space in the building, as well as a recent expansion in 2013 and 2015. We currently occupy the entire newly expanded facility. In 2017, we acquired the building and property at which the Adesis facility is located at 27 McCullough Drive in New Castle, Delaware. In 2019, we purchased 250 and 300 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to our corporate offices. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, collaboration, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. In 2021, we leased with an option to purchase a manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland for the production by PPG of our PHOLED materials. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European 27 Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

ITEM 6 . [RESERVED] None. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” in this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Item 1A of this report, entitled “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. 31 In 2021, we entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, we mutually agreed to extend the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year term. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, we announced an extension of the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2021, Adesis employed a team of 135 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As of December 31, 2021, OVJP employed a team of 25 research, mechanical, electrical and software engineers and laboratory technicians. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. In February 2021, we announced the establishment of a new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland and an agreement between UDC Ireland Limited and PPG for the production of our OLED materials. The new facility is expected to double our production capacity and allow for the diversification of our manufacturing base for phosphorescent emitters. We anticipate the facility to be operational by mid-year 2022. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. 32 We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020 and continued to have an impact during the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it may potentially have a further adverse impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the first half of 2022, including as a result of: We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the 2022 fiscal year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. 33 We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue and income taxes, as described below, are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the sale of our OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to our OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. We believe that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. We estimate total material units to be purchased by our customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and our forecast process. Our management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, our management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of our customers over the contract term. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of our assessment we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2021, based on previous earnings history, a current evaluation of expected future taxable income and other evidence, we determined to retain the valuation allowance that relates to New Jersey research and development credits. Actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is generated in future periods. To the extent we establish a new valuation allowance or change a previously established valuation allowance in a future period, income tax expense will be impacted. 34 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For a discussion of our results of operations comparison for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed on February 18, 2021. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (Decrease) Increase REVENUE: Material sales $ 318,623 $ 229,749 $ 88,874 Royalty and license fees 219,032 185,054 33,978 Contract research services 15,870 14,064 1,806 Total revenue 553,525 428,867 124,658 COST OF SALES 114,991 85,478 29,513 Gross margin 438,534 343,389 95,145 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 99,673 83,894 15,779 Selling, general and administrative 80,372 61,346 19,026 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 21,994 21,969 25 Patent costs 8,160 7,529 631 Royalty and license expense 691 11,125 (10,434 ) Total operating expenses 210,890 185,863 25,027 OPERATING INCOME 227,644 157,526 70,118 Interest income, net 505 5,139 (4,634 ) Other income, net 98 864 (766 ) Interest and other income, net 603 6,003 (5,400 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 228,247 163,529 64,718 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (44,034 ) (30,157 ) (13,877 ) NET INCOME $ 184,213 $ 133,372 $ 50,841 Revenue Our total material sales were $318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $229.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 39% with a commensurate increase in unit material volume of 34%. The increase in material sales was due to the recovery in sales that were adversely impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic during the year ended December 31, 2020, as well as strengthened demand for OLED products utilizing our emitter material. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $219.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 18%. This increase was due primarily to an overall strengthening of our customers’ sales of royalty-bearing OLED licensed products and was partially offset by a $3.3 million reduction in the cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net, arising from revisions in our customers' forecasted demand of emitters anticipated to be procured over their respective contract lives. Contract research services revenue was $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 13%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. 35 Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $29.5 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were increases in inventory reserve of $3.6 million and $1.1 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from material sales and royalty and license fees, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $95.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 79% from 80%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $99.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including those associated with OVJP technology development, increased contract research, and PPG development activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses, increased pre-production costs associated with the new manufacturing facility in Shannon, Ireland, as well as an increase in depreciation expenses resulting from corporate expansion. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $22.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in patent costs reflected higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 11 in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $505,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2020. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $98,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $864,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 19.3% and 18.4% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $44.0 million and $30.2 million, respectively, for those periods. 36 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $312.0 million, short-term investments of $351.2 million, and long-term U.S. Government bond investments of $159.6 million for a total of $822.8 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $630.0 million, short-term investments of $100.0 million and no long-term U.S. Government bonds investments for a total of $730.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $191.1 million resulting from $184.2 million of net income and $140.4 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $133.5 million, net reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $201.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $22.2 million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.9 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $46.1 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $25.4 million and an increase in other assets of $13.7 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $148.8 million resulting from $133.4 million of net income and $136.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $121.2 million reduction, net due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $192.4 million and an increase in other liabilities of $10.1 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $28.8 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $21.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million and an increase in other assets of $7.0 million. Cash used in investing activities was $457.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to cash provided by investing activities of $391.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $414.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to net sales and maturities of $419.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2021 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey. Cash used in financing activities was $51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $9.5 million and an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $555,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $331,000. Working capital was $738.0 million as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $759.6 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by an increase in short-term investments, an increase in inventory and an increase in accounts receivable. Several significant contractual obligations are anticipated to be incurred in future periods and include payments for retirement benefit plan obligations, lease obligations and PPG inventory commitments. Payments towards the retirement plan obligations are anticipated to commence during fiscal year 2023 in the amount of $10.9 million and total $82.8 million over the life of the plan. Existing lease obligations are $4.1 million for fiscal year 2022, $8.0 million for both fiscal years 2023 and 2024 and $14.2 million thereafter. Existing PPG inventory commitments are $25.7 million and will fluctuate based on PPG production needs to fulfill to our demand for commercial emitter material. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and our precautionary measures in response thereto may impact our business and thus our liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be precisely estimated at this time. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. 37 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMEN TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those statements are attached to this report beginning on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCO UNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROL S AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The report of management on our internal control over financial reporting and the associated attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm are set forth in Item 8 of this report.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based upon criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been attested to by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the following page. Steven V. Abramson President and Chief Executive Officer Sidney D. Rosenblatt Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 23, 2022 F- 2 Report of Independent R e gistered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 23, 2022 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts As discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for organic light emitting diode (OLED) sales to customers with long-term contracts (i.e., over 1 year in length) using certain estimates. Revenue is determined by estimating total contract consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract and recognized based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. The estimated per unit fee includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees, as well as estimates of material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. The Company uses internal and external data to estimate material units to be sold and royalty consideration to be received over the contract terms. We identified the assessment of the estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts as a critical audit matter. The estimated per unit fee was dependent upon the estimates of total material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating the forecasted material unit sales and royalties, as changes in the estimates could significantly affect the estimated per unit fee. F- 4 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including the Company’s review and approval of forecasted quantities of material unit sales of OLED products and review of forecasted royalties. We assessed the Company’s forecasting policies and procedures and the inputs used in making the estimates by considering other reasonably likely outcomes when evaluating potential management bias. Additionally, we inspected the forecast calculations for a selection of OLED contracts and compared the per-material unit prices and royalty rates used against the respective contract terms. We compared the OLED material unit sales forecast to internal operating and production budgets, and we compared the forecasted OLED material unit sales and royalties to the results of inquiries of Company personnel, publicly available market data, and analyst reports. We assessed the Company’s ability to accurately forecast OLED material unit sales and royalties by comparing recent historical forecasts to actual results and evaluating the Company’s conclusions regarding the reasons for changes in the current year’s estimates as compared to prior estimates. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F- 10 UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company’s technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and either license or otherwise commercialize the Company’s proprietary OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,500 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED material, device design and manufacturing technologies for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) and OLED Material Manufacturing Limited (OMM). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. In November 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UDC Ireland, OMM, was formed as an Ireland limited company. Based out of Shannon, Ireland, OMM was formed to lease a manufacturing facility to increase the Company’s production capacity to meet market demand and diversify the Company’s manufacturing base due to evolving industry requirements. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents F- 11 The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company’s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties and license fees. These receivables have historically been paid timely. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant risk of collection. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for credit losses would be required. The allowance for credit losses was $ 279,000 , $ 139,000 and $ 84,000 at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 30 years for buildings, 15 years for building improvements, and three to seven years for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any gain or loss is reflected in other operating expenses. Certain costs of computer software obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . Costs for maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to an existing system, are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Company management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31, 2021, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company’s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. Company management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If it is concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment assessment is not necessary. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, then its carrying value is written down to fair value. F- 12 The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. If necessary, the second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of December 31, 2021 utilizing a qualitative evaluation and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Adesis is greater than its carrying value. Company management believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. Future impairment tests will continue to be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs. As of December 31, 2021, no indications of impairment existed. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, investments, retirement plan benefit liability and other liabilities are carried at fair value. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair value of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy the claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgments include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. F- 13 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Total contract consideration is allocated to material sales and royalty and licensing fees on the Consolidated Statements of Income based on contract pricing. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. Technology development and support revenue is included in contract research services on the Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current commercial license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The terms of the agreements were set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty F- 14 revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2021, the Company entered into amendments of the 2015 OLED patent license agreement and the 2015 OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display, which amendments were effective as of January 1, 2021. The amended agreements included a term extension and are set to expire by the end of 2025. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2021, the parties extended the terms of both the patent license and material purchase agreements for an additional multi-year-term. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company granted certain of Visionox’s affiliates a non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. On April 22, 2021, the Company announced that it had extended the Visionox agreement by entering into new five-year OLED material supply and license agreements with a new affiliate of Visionox, Visionox Hefei Technology Co. Ltd. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in its licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. F- 15 Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the UDC Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for the OMM subsidiary and each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from OMM and its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adoption of New Accounting Standards In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions and improving consistent application in certain areas of Topic 740. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The adoption of ASU 2019-12, beginning on January 1, 2021, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. ASUs were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements. F- 16 The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government bonds and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2021 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 256,878 $ — $ — $ 256,878 Money market accounts 55,115 — — 55,115 $ 311,993 $ — $ — $ 311,993 December 31, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 163,779 $ — $ — $ 163,779 Money market accounts 17,261 — — 17,261 U.S. Government bonds 448,970 6 ( 4 ) 448,972 $ 630,010 $ 6 $ ( 4 ) $ 630,012 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2021 Certificates of deposit $ 240 $ — $ — $ 240 Corporate bonds 226,448 3 ( 97 ) 226,354 U.S. Government bonds 124,611 — ( 11 ) 124,600 $ 351,299 $ 3 $ ( 108 ) $ 351,194 December 31, 2020 U.S. Government bonds 99,929 67 — 99,996 $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 Long-term U.S. Government Bonds Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of long-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Long-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2021 U.S. Government bonds $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 $ 159,692 $ 10 $ ( 134 ) $ 159,568 The Company did not have any long-term investments classified as U.S. Government bonds as of December 31, 2020. Long-term Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early-stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the boards of directors of the companies in which it invests. Minority investments are included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had two minority investments with a total carrying value of $ 8.5 million accounted for as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. F- 17 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2021 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 55,115 $ 55,115 $ — $ — Short-term investments 351,194 351,194 — — Long-term U.S government bonds investments 159,568 159,568 — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 466,233 $ 466,233 $ — $ — Short-term investments 99,996 99,996 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020. Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Raw materials $ 75,227 $ 46,843 Work-in-process 16,065 9,904 Finished goods 42,868 34,844 Inventory $ 134,160 $ 91,591 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 3.6 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. F- 18 Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Land $ 2,642 $ 2,642 Building and improvements 76,600 53,568 Office and lab equipment 107,168 85,881 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 16,221 8,921 Construction-in-progress 18,662 23,594 221,293 174,606 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 92,461 ) ( 72,493 ) Property and equipment, net $ 128,832 $ 102,113 Depreciation expense was $ 20.0 million, $ 15.2 million and $ 12.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed intellectual property (IP) processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 Other 462 462 223,303 223,303 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 173,635 ) ( 153,050 ) Acquired technology, net $ 49,668 $ 70,253 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 20.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023, $ 9.6 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, $ 4.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2026 and $ 200,000 in total thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $ 105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years . F- 19 BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years . Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At December 31, 2021, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 4,973 ) $ 5,547 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 1,748 ) 3,072 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 818 ) 682 Other 436 ( 26 ) 410 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 17,276 $ ( 7,565 ) $ 9,711 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2022 - 2026) and $ 2.7 million in total thereafter. Goodwill As a result of the Adesis acquisition, the Company recorded $ 15.5 million of goodwill. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year unless events suggest an impairment may have been incurred in an interim period using Adesis’ standalone financial operating performance information. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires the exercise of judgment, including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit, as Adesis is considered to be the reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. As part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, there were no significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Adesis had occurred. Other assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Long-term taxes receivable $ 103,260 $ 90,208 Right-of-use assets 30,614 8,750 Other long-term assets 1,836 4,383 Other Assets $ 135,710 $ 103,341 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on right-of-use assets and non-current taxes receivable, respectively. The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include F- 20 options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 3,637 $ 2,091 $ 1,855 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 26,174 $ 1,948 $ 9,776 The increase in right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the commencement of the operating lease related to expansion of the Adesis research facilities in Wilmington, Delaware. The following table presents the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Right-of-use assets $ 30,614 $ 8,750 Short-term lease liabilities 3,351 1,871 Long-term lease liabilities 27,263 6,879 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: December 31, 2021 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 8.6 Weighted average discount rate 2.8 % As of December 31, 2021, current operating leases had remaining terms between eight months and ten years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2021, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2022 $ 4,098 2023 4,018 2024 3,966 2025 4,008 2026 4,021 Thereafter 14,222 Total lease payments 34,333 Less: imputed interest ( 3,719 ) Present value of lease payments $ 30,614 F- 21 Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Compensation $ 27,686 $ 22,147 PPG agreements 8,853 4,402 Research and development agreements 1,469 627 Consulting 1,314 771 Professional fees 1,000 908 Royalties 691 11,125 Other 4,461 1,424 Accrued expenses $ 45,474 $ 41,404 The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC) for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), the universities granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by the universities for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 691,000 , $ 11.1 million and $ 11.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline in the royalty expense was primarily due to the expiration of patents relating to the licensed products. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 4.3 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 1.3 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 997,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other liabilities consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Long-term taxes payable $ 47,791 $ 48,870 Long-term lease liabilities 27,263 6,879 Other long-term liabilities 1,023 192 Other Liabilities $ 76,077 $ 55,941 See Notes 9 and 20 for further explanation on long-term lease liabilities and long-term taxes payable, respectively. On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement, by amendment in February 2021, runs through December 31, 2024, F- 22 and thereafter is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. As noted above, in February 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to the New OLED Materials Agreement extending the term of the agreement and specifying operation and maintenance services that will be provided by PPG affiliate, PPG SCM Ireland Limited, to UDC Ireland, at the Company’s new manufacturing site in Shannon, Ireland, currently being leased by UDC Ireland’s wholly-owned subsidiary, OMM, for the production of OLED materials. Facility improvements and regulatory approvals are expected to be completed and operations are scheduled to commence by mid-year 2022. As with the initial New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company will compensate PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided at the Shannon manufacturing facility. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 3.6 million, $ 2.8 million and $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had issued 49,065,924 shares of common stock, of which 47,700,276 were outstanding. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. F- 23 Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted a total of 1,400 and 1,926 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value of the shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.80 per common share, or $ 37.9 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock.

Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Company's Human Capital Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through December 31, 2021, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of December 31, 2021, there were 1,781,003 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Award and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock unit (RSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2021 192,624 $ 160.99 Granted 116,024 208.67 Vested ( 78,455 ) 159.05 Forfeited ( 3,209 ) 177.41 Unvested, December 31, 2021 226,984 $ 184.93 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSU awards granted was $ 208.67 , $ 162.32 and $ 168.95 during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 7.7 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock award (RSA) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2021 141,661 $ 124.81 Granted 30,647 172.95 Vested ( 96,981 ) 95.47 Unvested, December 31, 2021 75,327 $ 185.86 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSA awards granted was $ 172.95 , $ 155.85 and $ 194.19 during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSAs was $ 20.0 million, $ 24.5 million and $ 28.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to restricted stock awards and units issued to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 15.4 million, $ 13.9 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 2.5 million, $ 1.9 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, and research and development expense of $ 5.2 million, $ 4.3 million and $ 2.5 million, respectively. F- 25 In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 69,798 , 86,442 and 86,075 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 14.1 million, $ 12.5 million and $ 14.0 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 220,000 , $ 380,000 and $ 632,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.2 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 916,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 5,412 , 6,456 and 9,332 shares during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized expense related to all restricted stock awards and units was $ 35.5 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.26 years. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units will not vest at all. The following table summarizes the activity related to performance unit awards (PSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2021 117,915 $ 165.48 Granted 74,074 214.70 Vested ( 9,035 ) 120.46 Unvested, December 31, 2021 182,954 $ 189.24 During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted 77,086 , 95,772 and 10,096 performance units, respectively, of which 42,291 , 47,885 and 5,050 units, respectively, are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 34,795 , 47,887 and 5,046 units, respectively, are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and which will vest over the terms described above. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no ne, 15,638 and 15,650 incremental performance-based shares, respectively, that vested resulting from an increased vesting factor based on Company performance. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 214.70 , $ 167.74 and $ 198.72 during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all performance stock units, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 8.0 million, $ 4.3 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 1.3 million, $ 670,000 and $ 208,000 , respectively, and research and development expense of $ 2.1 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 419,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 3,881 , 12,877 and 16,668 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 875,000 , $ 1.9 million and $ 2.6 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. F- 26 As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance unit awards was $ 21.4 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.94 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company issued 9,156 , 9,668 and 7,492 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.5 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 889,000 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded charges of $ 93,000 , $ 96,000 and $ 79,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 119,000 , $ 111,000 , $ 73,000 , respectively, to cost of sales and $ 188,000 , $ 139,000 and $ 118,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains the Universal Display Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan covers substantially all full-time employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to 90 % of their total compensation to the Plan, not to exceed the limit as defined in the Code. Once an employee is eligible to participate in the Plan, the Company will make a non-elective contribution equal to 3 % of the employee’s total compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $ 1.3 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 880,000 , respectively, to the Plan. Defined Benefit Plan On March 18, 2010, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Human Capital Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment and to encourage their continued employment with the Company. As of December 31, 2021 there were eight participants in the SERP. The SERP benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and in certain cases, the participant's average annual bonus for the most recent three fiscal years ending prior to the participant's date of termination of employment with the Company for the life of the participant. For this purpose, annual base salary means 12 times the average monthly base salary paid or payable to the participant during the 24 -month period immediately preceding the participant’s date of termination of employment, or, if required, the date of a change in control of the Company. Under the SERP, if a participant resigns or is terminated without cause at or after age 65 and with at least 20 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. The benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and bonus for the life of the participant. This percentage is 50 %, 25 % or 15 %, depending on the participant’s benefit class. F- 27 If a participant resigns at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit. If a participant is terminated without cause or on account of a disability after at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit in either case would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20 . In the event a participant is terminated for cause, his or her SERP benefit and any future benefit payments are subject to immediate forfeiture. The SERP benefit is payable in installments over 10 years, beginning at the later of age 65 or the date of the participant’s separation from service. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancy of the participant. This calculation is made as of the date benefit payments are to begin (later of age 65 or separation from service). If the participant dies after reaching age 65, any future or remaining benefit payments are made to the participant’s beneficiary or estate. If the participant dies before reaching age 65, the benefit is forfeited. In the event of a change in control of the Company, each participant will become immediately vested in his or her SERP benefit. Unless the participant’s benefit has already fully vested, if the participant has less than 20 years of service at the time of the change in control, he or she will receive a prorated benefit based on his or her number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. If the change in control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then each participant (including former employees who are entitled to SERP benefits) will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the benefit immediately upon the change in control. Certain of the Company’s executive officers are designated as special participants under the SERP. If these participants resign or are terminated without cause after 20 years of service, or at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, they will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. If they are terminated without cause or on account of a disability, they will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. The SERP benefit for special participants is based on 50 % of their annual base salary and bonus for their life and the life of their surviving spouse, if any. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancies of the participant and their surviving spouse, if any. If they die before reaching age 65, the benefit is not forfeited if the surviving spouse, if any, lives until the participant would have reached age 65. If their spouse also dies before the participant would have reached age 65, the benefit is forfeited. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates, and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. In connection with the initiation and subsequent amendments of the SERP, the Company recorded cost related to prior service of $ 22.8 million as accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2021. The prior service cost is being amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average of the remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ending December 31, 2022 is $ 2.6 million. Information relating to the Company’s plan is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 78,527 $ 51,117 Service cost 1,675 1,092 Interest cost 1,165 1,285 Actuarial (gain) loss ( 14,956 ) 25,033 Plan amendment 362 — Benefit obligation, end of year 66,773 78,527 Fair value of plan assets — — Unfunded status of the plan, end of year $ 66,773 $ 78,527 Current liability — — Non-current liability $ 66,773 $ 78,527 The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan was $ 63.3 million and $ 74.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The actuarial gain of $ 15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to a reduction in the three-year average F- 28 cash bonus paid to participants. The actuarial loss of $ 25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to an increase in the three year-average cash bonus paid to participants. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Service cost $ 1,675 $ 1,092 $ 969 Interest cost 1,165 1,285 1,613 Amortization of prior service cost 1,099 1,098 1,595 Amortization of loss 4,936 2,181 1,641 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 8,875 $ 5,656 $ 5,818 The measurement date is the Company’s fiscal year end. The net periodic pension cost is based on assumptions determined at the prior year end measurement date. Assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Discount rate 2.16 % 1.54 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Discount rate 1.54 % 2.64 % 3.82 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over future years based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants, when the accumulation of such gains or losses exceeds 10 % of the year end benefit obligation. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost or credit) is included in the Company’s results of income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the net periodic pension cost in 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Amortization of prior service cost $ 1,119 Amortization of loss 1,487 Total $ 2,606 Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future service, are currently expected to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year Projected Benefits 2022 $ — 2023 5,462 2024 5,462 2025 5,462 2026 6,709 2027-2031 37,528 Thereafter 22,217 F- 29 Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 11 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 11 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and 12 senior level employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If a covered person’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the person is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times (in the case of the executive officers) or either one or two times (in the case of the senior level employees) the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the person and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into the New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 13) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 25.7 million, $ 13.7 million and $ 22.0 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s material sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition F- 30 Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax under the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million each year since the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on the Korean Supreme Court decision, in October 2021, a tax refund request on behalf of the Company was filed with the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) for over-withheld taxes from 2018 to the second quarter of 2021. The Company has been advised by a leading Korean law firm that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 53.2 million and $ 40.1 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents. Also, the Company has recorded a long-term liability of $ 31.6 million and $ 32.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) which was accepted by the KNTS on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. The Internal Revenue Service and KNTS are currently exchanging information with respect to the MAP. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlying intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue and the ruling was affirmed by the Korean High Court in August 2021. The KNTS appealed the ruling to the Korean Supreme Court. On January 13, 2022, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed the appeal from the KNTS. UDC Ireland is expected to recover the charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding plus interest for the three-year period within a year after January 13, 2022. F- 33 The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2018 to 2021 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey has closed the 2014 to 2017 tax return audit of UDC, Inc. with no change to tax expense or tax credit carry forwards. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded 97 % of its revenue from OLED related sales and 3 % from the providing of services through Adesis. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of December 31, 2021 Accounts receivable $ 107,639 Short-term unbilled receivables 8,127 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 120,864 Long-term deferred revenue 36,217 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2021 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 29.1 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 192,778 Increases due to cash received — ( 201,484 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 13,926 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 32,720 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 35,022 ) — Net change ( 2,302 ) 5,220 Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 8,127 $ ( 157,081 ) Year Ended December 31, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue, net — 157,704 Increases due to cash received — ( 192,369 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net — 17,226 Unbilled receivables recorded, net 9,067 — Net change 9,067 ( 17,439 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) The c umulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $ 3.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. F- 34 The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Numerator: Net income $ 184,213 $ 133,372 $ 138,304 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 1,137 ) ( 1,001 ) ( 1,106 ) Adjusted net income $ 183,076 $ 132,371 $ 137,198 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,296,447 47,198,982 46,959,775 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 1,010 1,566 1,334 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 67,978 36,446 34,353 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,365,435 47,236,994 46,995,462 Net income per common share: Basic $ 3.87 $ 2.80 $ 2.92 Diluted $ 3.87 $ 2.80 $ 2.92 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, there were no unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive.

BUSINESS Our Company We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), portable media device and automotive markets. We believe that this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. Our technology leadership, our current intellectual property position, and our more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable us to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and OLED lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. Our primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license our proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. We have established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through our internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. We currently own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. We manufacture and sell our proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. We also enter into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which we grant them licenses to practice under our patents and to use our proprietary know-how. At the same time, we work with these and other companies that are evaluating our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Market Overview The Display Panel Market Thin, energy-efficient display panels that can be manufactured on glass or flexible substrates are essential for a wide variety of portable consumer electronics products, such as mobile phones, AR/VR headsets, digital cameras, wearables, tablets and notebook computers. Due to their narrow profile and light weight, flat panel displays are the display of choice for larger product applications, such as computer monitors and televisions. Liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, continue to dominate the flat panel display market. However, we believe that OLED displays are an attractive alternative to LCDs, and OLED displays are gaining market share, because they offer a number of potential advantages, including: • higher power efficiencies, thereby reducing energy consumption; • a thinner profile and lighter weight; • higher contrast ratios, leading to sharper picture images and graphics; • wider viewing angles; • deposition on non-rigid substrates which enable conformable and flexible displays; • faster response times for video and gaming; and • lower cost manufacturing methods and materials. Based on these characteristics, product manufacturers have adopted small-area OLED displays for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables and tablets. Manufacturers are increasingly commercializing large-area OLED displays for use in televisions. We believe that if these efforts are successful, they could result in sizeable markets for OLED displays. 2 Organic materials make technically possible the development of flexible displays for use in an entirely new array of product applications. Such applications include display devices that fold in use , or conform to various shapes for wearable, rollable, industrial and ruggedized applications. In addition, due to the inherent transparency of the organic materials and transparent electrode technologies, OLEDs eventually may enable the production of transparent displays for use in products such as automotive windshields and windows with embedded displays. The Solid-State Lighting Market Traditional incandescent light bulbs are inefficient because they convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into visible light, with the rest emerging as heat. Fluorescent lamps use excited gases, or plasmas, to achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of about 20%. However, the color rendering index of most fluorescent lamps – in other words, the quality of their color compared to an ideal light source – is inferior to that of an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent lamps also pose environmental concerns because they typically contain mercury. Solid-state lighting relies on the direct conversion of electricity to visible light using semiconductor materials. By avoiding the heat and plasma-producing processes of incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, respectively, solid-state lighting products can have substantially higher energy conversion efficiencies. There are currently two basic types of solid-state lighting devices: inorganic light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and OLEDs. Current LEDs are very small in size (about one square millimeter) and are extremely bright. Having been developed about 25 years before OLEDs, LEDs are already widely employed in a variety of lighting products, such as traffic lights, digital signage and billboards, replacements for incandescent lighting, backlights for smartphones, computer monitors and televisions, and as border or accent lighting. However, the most commercial LED offerings are characterized by high operating temperatures and intense brightness which may make them less desirable for many lighting applications. OLEDs, on the other hand, can be designed to provide improved lighting characteristics because they can be larger in size and can be viewed directly, without using diffusers that are required to temper the intense brightness of LEDs. OLEDs can be fabricated onto any suitable surface, including glass, plastic or metal foil, and could be cost-effective to manufacture in high volume. Given these characteristics, product manufacturers are working on and have introduced limited product applications of OLEDs for diffuse specialty lighting applications and ultimately general illumination. If these efforts are successful, we believe that OLED lighting products could begin to be used for applications currently addressed by other existing lighting technologies, as well as for new applications that take advantage of the OLED form factor. In particular, the ability of OLED technology to produce uniform illumination over arbitrary shapes is making OLED lighting very attractive to the automobile industry as well as the digital signage industry. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we currently are one of the leading technology developers in the OLED industry because we were the first company to develop and commercialize PHOLED emitter technology. Our experienced management and research teams have built an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our OLED technologies and materials, particularly with regard to PHOLED emitter materials, which we continually seek to enhance and grow. We work diligently, through the delivery of high-quality commercial products, superior technical support and customer service, to enable our industry-leading customers, which primarily are large display manufacturers, to adopt our OLED technologies and materials through implementation of long-term commercial material supply and patent and know-how license agreements. Our key competitive strengths include: Technology Leadership We are a recognized technology leader in the OLED industry. We, along with world-class academic partners Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), and the University of Michigan (Michigan), pioneered the development of our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technologies, which can be used to produce OLEDs that are up to four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs, which are illuminated using backlights. We believe that our PHOLED technologies and materials will continue to be well-suited for industry usage in the commercial production of OLED displays and lighting products. Through our internal, innovative research, which has produced the majority of our most critical commercial technologies, our relationships with supplier companies, such as PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and our existing and new academic partners, we believe that we can continue to advance the technology we have already developed and commercialized, and that we will continue to discover and develop other important OLED technologies, as well as novel OLED materials, that will facilitate further adoption of our various OLED technologies by product manufacturers. To this end, we have completed construction of two state-of-the-art laboratories, or Application Centers, near our larger customers in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe these Application Centers will provide us and 3 our customers with the ability to more quickly evaluate, develop and bring to market our newest OLED materials and technologies . We also are committing significant resources to explore the use of next - generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as organic vapor jet printing (OVJP) . Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property Generally, each of our commercial offerings is protected by multiple patents which can help us either to prevent or combat the introduction of counterfeit and/or knock-off products that could potentially impact the market demand for our OLED materials and technologies. Our strong patent and non-patented know-how portfolios in the areas of PHOLED emitter materials, complementary PHOLED materials, OLED device designs, and OLED manufacturing technologies are reflective of our continued commitment to innovate and invest. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the OLED industry. Through our internal development efforts, acquisitions, and long-standing relationships with academic partners, research institutions and product manufacturers, we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. We continue to enhance and grow our OLED technology and materials patent portfolio organically through internal research and development, partnering with third parties, and by acquisition. We also continue to accumulate valuable non-patented technical know-how relating to our OLED technologies and materials. Leading Supplier of UniversalPHOLED® Emitter Materials and Related Technology Licensing We are the leading supplier of PHOLED emitter materials to OLED device manufacturers. The emitter material, which is designed to efficiently convert electrical energy to a desired wavelength of light, is the key component in an OLED device. Our manufacturing partner of over 20 years, PPG, continues to manufacture our materials for us, using proprietary manufacturing processes and know-how, which materials we then qualify to our exacting product specifications and resell on a just-in-time basis to OLED device manufacturers. We record revenues based on our sales of these materials to OLED device manufacturers. Our commercial supply agreements typically require our customers to purchase minimum quantities of our materials, which purchases can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or as a minimum percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. Our commercial supply arrangements allow us to maintain close technical and business relationships with these OLED device manufacturers purchasing our proprietary materials, and thereby further supports our technology licensing business. We do not directly manufacture or sell OLED display or lighting products. Instead, we enter into non-exclusive licensing arrangements with OLED device manufacturers, many of which also purchase our materials, that pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties based on their sales of licensed commercial products using our proprietary technology and patents. We believe this business model allows us to concentrate on our core strengths of technology development and innovation, while at the same time provides significant operating leverage. We also believe that this approach may reduce potential competitive conflicts with our customers. Long-Standing Customer Relationships We have long-standing customer relationships with OLED device manufacturers that are using, or are evaluating for use, our OLED materials in commercial OLED products. We have more than 20 years of experience in working closely with OLED device manufacturers and have provided support to them in their commercialization of OLED technology by delivering customer-specific solutions for red, green, and yellow emitter materials, or dopants. We have a proven track record of delivering consistent, high-quality OLED material to our customers. We provide just-in-time supply to our customers and serve as a sole source to them for many of our critical materials. We believe that our unparalleled manufacturing partners, namely PPG, our well-established supply chain, our multi-tier quality testing, and our product assurance protocols make us a preferred partner for our customers and for any large-scale OLED display manufacturer that wants to deliver to high-quality international end-customers. In 2020, our largest customers for our PHOLED materials included Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE), Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma), Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox), Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT), Shenzhen Royale Display Technologies Co. Ltd., Japan Display, Inc., Sharp Corporation, and AU Optronics Corporation (AU Optronics). Other licensed customers of our technology in 2020 included Kaneka Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and OLEDWorks L.L.C. 4 Complementary UniversalPHOLED ® Host Material Business In addition to our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® emitter materials, we continue to develop, supply and offer for sale certain of our proprietary phosphorescent host materials to OLED device manufacturers. In addition, we have entered into a number of host material strategic partnerships through development agreements with OLED material partners that are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in order to optimize the performance of our emitters in our customers’ newest product designs. We do not believe that revenue from our host development and third-party collaboration agreements will be significant compared with our emitter business. However, we believe that development and collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring the continued success of the OLED industry and the broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies in the marketplace. Experienced Management and Scientific Advisory Team Our management team has significant experience in developing business models focused on licensing disruptive technologies in high growth industries. The team has strong relationships with, and deep understandings of, our customers and their needs, the commercial marketplace and the OLED industry on the whole. We believe our management team’s experience and long-standing relationships are important to maintaining good and accommodating working relationships with our customers, particularly when we are confronted with challenging technical, regulatory and trade issues given our international reach. In addition, we employ and contract with some of the leading researchers in the industry, and we maintain a long-standing Scientific Advisory Board that includes industry pioneers, namely Professor Stephen R. Forrest of Michigan (formerly of Princeton) and Professor Mark E. Thompson of USC. Our Business Strategy Our current business strategy is to continue to promote and expand our portfolio of OLED technologies and materials for widespread use in OLED displays and lighting products. We generate revenues primarily by selling our proprietary OLED materials and licensing our OLED technologies to display and lighting product manufacturers. We are presently focused on the following steps to implement our business strategy: Expand Our Collaborative Relationships with Leading Product Manufacturers and Developers We collaborate and partner with leading manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are commercial licensees of our OLED technologies and purchasers of our OLED materials. We also supply our proprietary OLED materials to manufacturers and developers of OLED displays and lighting products for evaluation and for use in product development and for pre-commercial activities, and we provide technical assistance and support to these manufacturers and developers to foster ongoing relationships and new commercial agreements. We concentrate on working closely with OLED device manufacturers and developers because we believe that the successful incorporation of our technologies and materials into commercial products is critical to their widespread adoption. Enhance Our Existing Portfolio of PHOLED Technologies and Materials We believe that a strong portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products is critical to our continued success, particularly as the utilization of PHOLED technologies and materials expands in the marketplace. Consequently, we are continually seeking to expand this portfolio through our internal development efforts, our collaborative relationships with existing and new academic and other research partners, and other strategic opportunities, such as funding early-stage startup companies whose technology may be synergistic to ours. Since the acquisition of the early fundamental research developed by our initial academic partners, Princeton and USC, in the late 1990’s, one of our primary goals has been and continues to be the development of new and improved PHOLED technologies and materials with increased efficiencies, enhanced color gamut and extended lifetimes, which are compatible with different manufacturing methods, so that they can be used by various manufacturers in a broad array of OLED display and lighting products. Develop Next-Generation Organic Technologies We continue to conduct research and development activities relating to next-generation OLED technologies for both displays and lighting products, including next generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as OVJP, which we discuss in more detail below. We also are funding research by existing and new academic partners and research institutions on the use of organic thin-film technology in other applications. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to enable us to maintain our position as a leading provider of OLED and other organic electronics technologies and materials as new markets emerge. 5 Business and Geographic Markets We derive revenue from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Most manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are or might potentially be interested in our OLED technologies and materials are currently located outside of the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide on-the-ground support to these manufacturers, we have established wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong, as well as a representative office in Taiwan. We also have recently completed the construction of new Application Centers in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea, which we believe will allow our Asia-based display manufacturers to evaluate our technology more quickly and incorporate the technology into their commercial designs. Our wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, UDC Ireland Ltd. (UDC Ireland), is responsible for all material sales worldwide (excluding the United States) and for licensing and managing intellectual property and undertaking certain other business transactions in all non-U.S. territories. In 2020, we received a majority of our revenue from three customers domiciled in the Asia-Pacific region, BOE, LG Display and SDC, each of which had revenue in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenue. Our business is heavily dependent on our relationships with these customers. Substantially all revenue derived from our customers is denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally enter into long-term agreements with our customers, which may include (1) a commercial supply agreement for the purchase of specific OLED materials, and (2) patent and know-how license agreements that relate to the manufacture of display and lighting devices. Generally, our commercial material supply agreements provide for multi-year purchase commitments, typically on a price per gram basis, which entitle our customers to certain discounts, technical support on the use of our OLED materials in mass production facilities, and access to certain future OLED materials. In order to secure preferential pricing and technology access, a customer typically agrees to certain minimum purchase obligations which can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or a percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. If a customer does not meet its minimum purchase obligations, generally we would have the right to review pricing for future material sales and impose other financial penalties. Our patent and know-how license agreements generally are made available to our customers for the manufacture of OLED devices. In addition, we also may license to certain material company partners the right to manufacture certain OLED materials that are complementary to our phosphorescent emitter materials. These licenses have included licenses to make host products and certain other non-phosphorescent materials. We believe it is in our, and our customers’ best interests to facilitate the development of materials that are complementary to our offerings and which assist our customers to produce more efficient and manufacturable devices with our materials. These collaboration efforts are likely to generate additional licensing fees for us under our license agreements. Although our customers generally pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties for OLED licensed products that they manufacture, our material partner licensees generally pay us a portion of their sales for materials that are developed under material collaboration agreements and subsequently commercialized. To date, these material collaboration arrangements have not generated significant revenues for us. For more information on our revenues, costs and expenses associated with our business, as well as a breakdown of revenues from North America and foreign sources, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included elsewhere in this report. Our Technology and its Relation to OLED Technology and Structure OLED devices are solid-state semiconductor devices made from thin films of organic material that emit light of various wavelengths when electricity is selectively applied to the emissive layer of the device. OLED devices are typically referred to as incorporating an “OLED stack.” OLED stacks vary in specific structure but those commonly used today may include a cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, an emissive layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer and an anode, all of which are placed on a substrate which may be made of a number of different materials, including glass, plastic and metal. Our technology and materials are most commonly utilized in the emissive layer; the materials in the emissive layer are the light-generating component of the OLED stack. Many of our key technologies relate primarily to phosphorescent emitter materials, which 6 we believe are more energy efficient than fluorescent emitter materials that can also be used to generate light within the emissive layer of the OLED device. We began selling emitter materials commercially in 2003. A manufacturer will use a small amount of emitter material for each device through a process called “doping” into a host material. The emitter material(s) and the host material(s) together form an emissive layer system. Depending on the nature of the OLED device, the emissive materials and emissive layer system may be designed to emit different colors. We have commercially produced and sold phosphorescent emitter materials that produce red, yellow, green and light-blue light, which are combined in various ways for the display and lighting markets. Our current materials business, conducted outside the United States by UDC Ireland, is focused primarily on the delivery of such emissive materials. We have also developed host materials for the emissive layer and began selling them commercially in 2011. In addition to our materials, which are generally protected by patents covering various molecular structures, we also have system and process patents that cover various fundamentally important aspects of the OLED device, device architectures, use of materials in devices and OLED manufacturing processes. These patents are important to our licensing business because they enable us to provide our business partners important OLED related technologies. Our PHOLED Technologies PHOLED technologies utilize specialized materials and device structures that allow OLEDs to emit light through a process known as phosphorescence. Traditional fluorescent OLEDs emit light through an inherently less efficient process. Theory and experiment show that PHOLEDs exhibit device efficiencies up to four times higher than those exhibited by fluorescent OLEDs. Phosphorescence substantially reduces the power requirements of an OLED and is useful in displays for hand-held devices, such as smartphones, where battery power is often a limiting factor. Phosphorescence is also important for large-area displays such as televisions, where higher device efficiency and lower heat generation may enable longer product lifetimes and increased energy efficiency. We have a strong intellectual property portfolio surrounding our existing PHOLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products which we market under the UniversalPHOLED® brand. We devote a substantial portion of our efforts to developing new and improved proprietary PHOLED materials and device architectures for red, green, yellow, blue and white OLED devices. In 2020, we continued our commercial supply relationships with companies such as BOE, LG Display, SDC, Tianma, CSOT and Visionox to use our PHOLED materials to manufacture OLED displays. In addition, we have worked and continue to work closely with customers evaluating and qualifying our proprietary PHOLED materials for commercial usage in both displays and lighting products, and with other material suppliers to combine our PHOLED emitters with their phosphorescent hosts and other OLED materials. Our Additional Proprietary OLED Technologies Our intellectual property, research, development and commercialization efforts also encompass a number of other OLED device and manufacturing technologies, including, but not limited to, the following: FOLED ™ Flexible OLEDs We are working on a number of technologies required for the fabrication of OLEDs on flexible substrates. Most other flat panel displays are built on rigid glass substrates. In contrast, FOLEDs are OLEDs built on non-rigid substrates such as plastic or metal foil. This has the potential to enhance durability and enable conformation to certain shapes or repeated bending or flexing. Many OLED smartphone displays are built on plastic substrates including those produced by SDC and LG Display. Several of our customers demonstrated different foldable and rollable FOLED displays at the 2021 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas, NV. The commercial introduction of such FOLED product offerings demonstrates the viability of new display product applications, such as portable, roll-up communications televisions, tablets, notebook computers and smartphones, as well as enhance the usefulness of such devices in ruggedized, industrial and wearable computing systems. Manufacturers also may be able to produce FOLEDs using more efficient continuous, or roll-to-roll, processing methods in the future. Our internal research and development efforts are expected to enhance and promote the future adoption of consumer and industrial FOLED devices. OVJP® Organic Vapor Jet Printing OLEDs could be manufactured using other processes as well, including OVJP. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask ( i.e. , the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. In 2019, we installed a new red-green-blue OVJP pilot tool at our Ewing, New 7 Jersey facility, and we continue to collaborate on OVJP technology development with Professor Forrest of Michigan. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp) , was formed as a Delaware c orporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary OVJP technology. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large - size OLED panel s while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies . Thin-Film Encapsulation We have developed proprietary, patented encapsulation technology for the packaging of flexible OLEDs and other thin-film devices, as well as for use as a barrier film for plastic substrates. Addressing a major roadblock to the successful commercialization of flexible OLEDs, our hybrid, multi-layer approach provides barrier performance useful for OLEDs using a potentially cost-effective process. In addition to potentially accelerating the commercial viability of flexible OLEDs, our thin-film encapsulation technology has the potential to provide benefits for a variety of other flexible thin-film devices, including photovoltaics and thin-film batteries. UniversalP 2 OLED® Printable Phosphorescent OLEDs The standard approach for manufacturing a small molecule OLED, including a PHOLED, is based on a vacuum thermal evaporation, or VTE, process. With a VTE process, the thin layers of organic material in an OLED are deposited in a high-vacuum environment. An alternate approach for patterning a small molecule OLED involves solution processing of the various organic materials in an OLED using techniques such as spin coating or inkjet printing onto the substrate. Solution-processing methods, and inkjet printing in particular, have the potential to be scalable to large-area displays. Our Strategic Relationships with Product Manufacturers We have established early-stage evaluation programs, development and pre-commercial programs, and commercial arrangements with a substantial number of manufacturers or potential manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products. Many of these relationships are directed towards tailoring our proprietary OLED technologies and materials for use by individual manufacturers. Our ultimate objective is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to these manufacturers for their commercial production of OLED products. Relationships with OLED Display Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to display manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. We have been collaborating with some of these display manufacturers for nearly 20 years. We have been working with SDC and providing our PHOLED materials to SDC for evaluation since 2001. Under the terms of a 2011 patent license agreement, we licensed our patents and technologies to SDC for its manufacture and sale of AMOLED display products. Under the terms of a 2011 supplemental purchase agreement, we supplied our proprietary PHOLED materials to SDC for its use in manufacturing licensed products. We also continue to supply SDC with our proprietary UniversalPHOLED materials for use in its development efforts under a 2001 joint development agreement. The 2011 license and purchase agreements with SDC expired on December 31, 2017, and on February 13, 2018, we entered into new patent license and supplemental purchase agreements, both with an effective date of January 1, 2018. These agreements, which cover the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, last through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under these agreements, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. These agreements convey to SDC the non-exclusive right to make and sell licensed products covered by certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. The 2018 supplemental purchase agreement provides for minimum annual purchase obligations of phosphorescent emitter material from us for use in the manufacture of the licensed products. SDC is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for smartphones and other personal electronic devices and produces displays for a number of different smartphone and electronic device manufacturers. We have been working with LG Display and its affiliates for over 15 years. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under 8 these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. LG Display is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for large - area televisions and produces display panels for a number of different television manufacturers. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma. Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE. Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox. Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with CSOT. In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in licensed products. We have been collaborating with AU Optronics since 2001, and we continue to provide our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics under a 2016 commercial supply agreement through which AU Optronics also has certain license rights. We also continue to support numerous display manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, through evaluation arrangements in which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for limited scale commercial production, evaluation and for purposes of development, manufacturing qualification and product testing. Many of these strategic relationships have been in place for longer than a decade, and we continue to establish new relationships. Relationships with OLED Lighting Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to lighting manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. Many of these strategic relationships have also been in place for longer than a decade. Since 2004, we have been supporting Konica Minolta in its efforts to develop OLED lighting products. We continue to license our patents and technology to Konica Minolta under a 2008 OLED technology license agreement for its manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products that utilize our phosphorescent and other OLED technologies. We also continue to provide Konica Minolta with our proprietary PHOLED materials for its manufacture of commercial OLED lighting products under a 2011 commercial material supply agreement, and for evaluation purposes under a 2012 evaluation agreement. We also continue to license our OLED patents to Sumitomo under a 2015 OLED patent portfolio license agreement in which we granted Sumitomo a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing license to make and sell OLED lighting panels using a solution-based manufacturing process. Under the license agreement, Sumitomo may also purchase certain of our phosphorescent materials. We continue to supply LG Display with materials in connection with the OLED lighting business it acquired from LG Chem, Ltd. (LG Chem). This lighting business continues to generate commercial chemical sales and license fee revenues under a limited-term commercial sales agreement we signed with LG Chem prior to its acquisition. We continue to license our OLED patents, and to provide our OLED materials, to OLEDWorks for use in OLED lighting products under patent license and commercial supply agreements signed in 2015. We have also extended the rights under these agreements to OLEDWorks GmbH, the German company and facility that OLEDWorks acquired in 2015 from Philips Technologie GmbH. We continue to license our technologies and patents to Kaneka for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products, under the terms of a 2013 license agreement, and we continue to supply our materials to Kaneka under a 2014 commercial material supply agreement. We also have a license agreement for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products with Pioneer, among others. 9 Similar to our arrangements with display manufacturers, we continue to support numerous lighting manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, typically through evaluation agreements under which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for evaluation and potential commercial application. Relationships with Manufacturers for Other Commercial Products In addition to our relationships with lighting and display manufacturers, we have agreements and arrangements with manufacturers or potential manufacturers to use our proprietary OLED technologies and materials in other commercial products, such as in automotive interiors and exteriors. Our OLED Materials Manufacturing Business We supply our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® materials to display manufacturers, lighting manufacturers and others. These materials are produced in batch quantities by PPG to our exacting product specifications using our manufacturing process and know-how. We qualify each batch of emitters at our device qualification facilities to ensure that they meet required specifications, and we store qualified product inventory for delivery to our customers. We believe that our inventory-carrying practices, along with the terms under which we sell our OLED materials (including payment terms), are typical for the markets in which we operate. In 2018, our OLED materials business received recertification in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems. In 2018, UDC’s Ewing, NJ facility also received certification in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems. PPG We have maintained a close working relationship with PPG since 2000. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with PPG, the term of which continues through December 31, 2021 and is automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Under that agreement, PPG is responsible, under our direction, for manufacturing scale-up of our proprietary OLED materials, and for supplying us with those materials. We use these materials for our own research and development as well as for resale to our customers, both for their evaluation and for use in commercial OLED products. Through our collaboration with PPG, key raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis. We have not had any issues with obtaining access to adequate amounts of any key raw materials. Collaborations with Other OLED Material Manufacturers We continued our non-exclusive collaborative relationships with OLED material manufacturing customers during 2020. Most of these relationships are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in an effort to optimize our PHOLED emitter products and deliver a high-performance system to the end customer. Our product manufacturing customers are not required to purchase host materials from us. As a result, we do not believe these collaboration efforts will generate significant revenue for us as compared to our emitter and licensing businesses. We believe, however, that collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring success of the OLED industry and broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies. Research and Development Our research and development activities are focused on the advancement of our OLED technologies and materials for displays, lighting and other applications. We conduct this research and development primarily internally and also through various relationships with commercial business partners, academic partners, and research institutions. We also have formed a venture capital company, UDC Ventures LLC, to invest in companies that we believe are developing synergistic or complementary technologies to ours. Internal Development Efforts Ewing, New Jersey Facility We conduct a substantial portion of our OLED development activities at our state-of-the-art development and testing facility in Ewing, New Jersey. At this expanded facility, which now exceeds 50,000 square feet, we perform technology development, including device and process optimization, prototype fabrication, manufacturing scale-up studies, process and product testing, characterization and reliability studies, and technology transfer with our business partners. Our Ewing facility houses multiple OLED deposition systems, including a full-color flexible OLED system and an OVJP system. In addition, the facility contains equipment for substrate patterning, organic material deposition, display packaging, module assembly and extensive testing in Class 100 and 100,000 clean rooms and opto-electronic test laboratories. Our facility also includes 10 state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical chemistry laboratories in which we conduct OLED materials research and make small quantities of new materials that we then test in OLED devices. Application Centers In addition to our laboratory facilities in Ewing, New Jersey, in 2019 we completed the construction of new, leased, Application Centers in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea. We believe these centers, which include state-of-the-art OLED laboratories, will better assist our Asia-based customers in their timely evaluation and adoption of our proprietary PHOLED materials, know-how and technologies in their respective PHOLED designs. Our Contract Research Organization Business: Adesis, Inc. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis). Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. Adesis currently operates in its headquarters facility, which it purchased in 2017 and consists of over 47,500 square feet in New Castle, Delaware and another, leased, 7,000 square foot facility in Wilmington, Delaware. As of December 31, 2020, Adesis employed a team of 100 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 60% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. Although we expect to continue to utilize the majority of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, Adesis is expected to continue operating as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries. University-Sponsored Research Princeton, USC and Michigan We have long-standing relationships with Princeton and USC, dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to our OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials for applications such as displays and lighting. This research, which generated many of the original fundamental PHOLED concepts and underlying patents that we commercialized, had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Thompson. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan, where we continue to fund his research. In connection with Professor Forrest’s transfer to Michigan, in 2006 we entered into a new sponsored research agreement with USC under which we are funding organic electronics research being conducted by Drs. Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. As with the 1997 Research Agreement, we have exclusive license rights to all OLED and thin-film organic electronic patents (other than for organic photovoltaic solar cells) arising out of this research. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years. We make payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2020, we were obligated to pay USC up to $6.9 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. Other Academic Relationships We entered into a contract research agreement with the Chitose Institute of Science and Technology of Japan (CIST) in 2004. Under that agreement, we funded a research program headed by Professor Chihaya Adachi relating to high-efficiency OLED materials and devices. We were granted exclusive rights to all intellectual property developed under this program. Our relationship with CIST ended in 2006 when Professor Adachi transferred to Kyushu University. However, we have continued our relationship with Professor Adachi under a separate consulting arrangement. In 2006 and 2007, we entered into one-year research agreements with Kyung Hee University to sponsor research programs on flexible, amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology. The programs were directed by Professor Jin Jang. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into contract research agreements with Silicon Display Technology, Ltd. (SDT), a company founded by Professor Jang, and in 2013, we entered into another one-year agreement with SDT. We continue to maintain a good working relationship with Professor Jang. Over the years, we have also entered into research agreements with various universities and research institutions that have been able to provide tailored research capabilities and insights relating to our PHOLED technology. As the utilization of PHOLED technology continues to expand, we intend to further engage key researchers at other universities and research institutions to help identify additional fundamental technologies that could benefit PHOLED technology implementation. 11 U.S. Government-Funded Research In the past, we have entered into U.S. government contracts and subcontracts to fund a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation OLED technologies concentrated primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. On contracts for which we were the prime contractor, we subcontracted portions of the work to various entities and institutions. All of the U.S. government contracts and subcontracts that we have entered into were subject to termination at the election of the contracting governmental agency. We do not believe that any of these U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Intellectual Property Along with our personnel, our primary and most fundamental assets are patents and other intellectual property. This includes more than 5,000 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense. It also includes a substantial body of non-patented technical know-how that we have accumulated over time. Our Patents Our research and development activities, conducted both internally and through collaborative programs with third parties, have resulted in our filing of a substantial number of patent applications relating to our OLED technologies and materials. These patents that we own represent, among other things, innovations beyond the original fundamental PHOLED conceptual patents that we license from Princeton, USC and Michigan, described below. Although many of these licensed fundamental conceptual patents have expired or will do so soon, our internal research efforts include essential innovations that have generated commercially viable implementations of the original PHOLED concepts and patents. As of December 31, 2020, we owned more than 4,900 unexpired issued patents and pending patent applications around the world in addition to the hundreds of patents and patent applications we exclusively license from our research partners, as discussed below. Patents We License from Research Partners We exclusively license patent rights from a number of university research partners. Generally, we sponsor scientific researchers at universities to undertake pre-defined research programs, and in exchange we receive license rights to patents that may be developed under the programs. As part of these programs, we may provide compensation in the form of support for research program-related activities, reimbursement for patent related costs, as well as providing for some forms of licensing and/or sublicensing fees for licensed technology that is commercialized by us or our customers. The earliest of our research partners included Princeton, USC, and Michigan, which developed some of the early breakthrough PHOLED technology and related patents in the mid to late 1990’s, some of which are now expired. In addition to our continuing work with these universities, we have expanded our sponsored research programs to include additional scientific researchers at other institutions that we believe can provide breakthroughs in promising new fields of research that may benefit the OLED marketplace. As of December 31, 2020, the patent rights we exclusively license from all our university research partners included more than 750 issued patents and pending patent applications in jurisdictions around the world. Under our university patent license agreements, we are generally free to sublicense to third parties all or any portion of the licensed patent rights for the life of the licensed patents, though our rights are subject to termination for an uncured material breach or default by us, or if we become bankrupt or insolvent. As part of our university license agreements, we may be required to compensate the universities to the extent we, or our sublicensees, utilize the licensed technology. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement with Princeton we are required to pay Princeton royalties for licensed products sold by us or our sublicensees. These royalties amount to 3% of the net sales price for licensed products sold by us and 3% of the revenues we receive for licensed patents used by our sublicensees. Princeton shares portions of these royalties with USC and Michigan under their inter-institutional agreements. We owed royalties under the 1997 Amended License Agreement with Princeton of $11.1 million for 2020. Acquired Patents and Other Intellectual Property From time to time we acquire patents and other intellectual property that we believe provide strategic business opportunities, such as the patent and technology portfolio we acquired from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Motorola, Inc.) (Motorola) in 2011, and the following portfolios from Fujifilm Corporation and BASF: 12 Patents We Acquired from Fujifilm Corporation In 2012, we entered into a Patent Sale Agreement (the Fujifilm Agreement) with Fujifilm. Under the Fujifilm Agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $109.5 million. The Fujifilm Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The Fujifilm Agreement permitted us to assign all of our rights and obligations under the Fujifilm Agreement to our affiliates, and we assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement, our rights and obligations to UDC Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. Patents We Acquired from BASF In 2016, UDC Ireland entered into an IP Transfer Agreement (the BASF Agreement) with BASF. Under the BASF Agreement, BASF sold us more than 500 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $96.0 million. The transactions contemplated by the BASF Agreement were consummated on June 28, 2016. Intellectual Property Developed under Our Government Contracts We and our subcontractors have developed, and may continue to develop, patentable OLED technology inventions under our various U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. Under these arrangements, we or our subcontractors generally can elect to take title to any patents on these inventions, and to control the manner in which these patents are licensed to third parties. However, the U.S. government reserves rights to these inventions and associated technical data that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications, or to third parties for commercial applications. In addition, if the U.S. government determines that we or our subcontractors have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these inventions in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government may require that we or our subcontractors license these inventions to third parties in that field of use. We do not believe that our current U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Non-patented Technical Know-How We have accumulated, and continue to accumulate, a substantial amount of non-patented technical know-how relating to OLED technologies and materials. Where practicable, we share portions of this information with display manufacturers and other business partners on a confidential basis. We also employ various methods to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, although no such methods can afford complete protection. Moreover, because we derive some of this information and know-how from academic institutions, there is an increased potential for public disclosure. We also cannot prevent the actual independent development of the same or similar information and know-how by third parties. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against alternative display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as other OLED technologies. We also compete in the lighting market against incumbent technologies, such as incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, and inorganic LEDs, and against emerging technologies, such as other OLED technologies. Display Panel Industry Competitors Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing and improving LCD, which includes quantum dot LCDs (which are sometimes referred to as QLEDs), and other display technologies that compete with our OLED display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies can compete with LCDs, QLEDs and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video rates, form factor and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur. Lighting Industry Competitors Although there has been a movement to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs throughout many countries, traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps remain well-entrenched products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state LEDs have been introduced into the market and would compete with OLED lighting products. LEDs have realized significant market adoption in the general lighting market. Having attributes different from fluorescent lamps and LEDs, OLEDs may compete directly with these products for certain lighting applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact 13 fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might occur. OLED Technologies and Materials Competitors Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) developed and patented the original fluorescent OLED technology in 1987. Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd. (CDT), which was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company in 2007, developed and patented polymer OLED technology in 1989. Display and lighting manufacturers, including customers of ours, are engaged in their own OLED research, development and commercialization activities, and have developed and may continue to develop proprietary OLED technologies that are necessary or useful for commercial OLED devices. In addition, other material manufacturers, such as Sumitomo, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (Idemitsu Kosan), Merck KGaA, Cynora Gmbh and Kyulux Inc., are selling or sampling competing OLED materials to customers, including companies to which we sell our proprietary PHOLED materials. Our licensing business is based on our control of a broad portfolio of OLED-related device patents and technologies. We believe this portfolio includes fundamental patents in the field of phosphorescent OLED materials and devices, as well as certain additional complementary OLED technologies. As discussed above, alternative technologies, such as fluorescent OLED emitter materials, exist and could be competitive to our phosphorescent OLED material solutions. However, fluorescent materials have characteristics that we believe many market participants consider less desirable than those of phosphorescent materials. Suppliers of fluorescent emitter materials include Doosan Solus, Dow Chemical (previously Gracel Display), Idemitsu Kosan and SFC Co. Ltd. Fluorescent materials may also be viewed as complementary in that they can be used in the same OLED stack as phosphorescent materials. The competitive landscape with respect to our host materials business is characterized by a larger number of established chemical material suppliers who have long-term relationships with many of our existing customers and licensees. We have elected to partner with certain of these companies to manufacture and deliver host solutions to our customers, as well as selling our host materials directly to device manufacturers. We believe our competitive advantage stems, in part, from our deep knowledge of our phosphorescent emitter materials, which are complementary with the host solutions. We believe that our understanding of phosphorescent emitter materials enables us to create host material solutions that are especially well suited for use with a certain class of emitter materials that are implemented commercially today. However, we note that many of our technology partners have their own host solutions and the competitive landscape includes many well-established companies such as Solus, Advanced Materials Co., Dow Chemical, Duksan Neolux Co., Ltd., Idemitsu Kosan, Merck KGaA, NSCC and Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. These companies have significant resources, and some may aggressively pursue such business in the future. Our existing business relationships with SDC and other product manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve a significant level of market penetration in the display and lighting industries. However, others, such as those working to develop thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and micro-LED alternative technologies, may succeed in developing new OLED technologies, materials and alternative solutions that may supplement or be utilized in place of ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers will adopt and continue to utilize our OLED technologies and materials for the production of commercial displays and lighting products. Our Venture Capital Business: UDC Ventures LLC We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UDC Ventures LLC, in March 2019, as a corporate venture capital entity that funds companies we believe are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic or complementary to our business and/or business strategies or which may otherwise provide favorable investment opportunities. Human Capital As of December 31, 2020, we had 349 active full-time employees and one part-time employee, none of whom are unionized. Of these employees, 242 are research scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians at our domestic and international facilities. This team includes chemists, physicists, engineers and technicians with physics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and organic/inorganic chemistry backgrounds, and highly-trained theoreticians and experimentalists. We believe that relations with our employees are good. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact lives and businesses around the world. We have taken proactive steps to help protect the health and safety of our employees and maintain business continuity. A significant majority of our office workers continue to telecommute. Within our production and office areas we have established a number of safety protocols, including face covering and physical distance requirements, enhanced cleaning, encouraging daily self-health checks, and mandatory temperature screening stations managed by health professionals. We have also implemented a coronavirus testing protocol in certain of our offices where the incidence of COVID outbreaks may impact critical operations. As part of that reporting process, we have developed a robust contact tracing program to identify employees who were in close contact with any ill employee in the workplace. All of the actions above are 14 overseen by a Crisis Management Working Group, a multi-functional, multi-discipline team tasked with integrating all aspects of our COVID-19 response. Our goal is to be a diverse and inclusive company. Guided by our values, we are committed to creating a company where everyone is included and respected, and where we support each other in reaching our full potential. We are committed to diverse representation across all levels of our workforce to reflect the vibrant and thriving diversity of the communities in which we live and work. Women represent 33% of our executive management team, 23% of our leadership (Director level and above) and 24% of our total workforce, as well as 33% of our Board of Directors. We have employees from over 25 countries in our workforce, and we believe that a diverse workforce made up of people with different ideas, strengths, interests and cultural backgrounds drives employee and business success. In 2020 our voluntary turnover rate was 5%, and we had overall employee growth rate of 13%. Additional data, including historical turnover and diversity information, as well as our corporate policies relating to our employee engagement and human capital, are updated on our website www.oled.com, and included in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report. Our Company History Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1985. Our business was commenced in 1994 by a company then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. functions as an operating subsidiary of ours and has certain overlapping officers and directors. We have also formed or acquired other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited (2008), Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (2010), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK (2011), UDC Ireland Ltd. (2012), Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. (2016), Adesis, Inc. (2016), UDC Ventures LLC (2019), and OVJP Corporation (2020), and we established a representative office in Taiwan (2011). Our Compliance with Environmental Protection Laws We are not aware of any material effects that compliance with Federal, State or local environmental protection laws or regulations will have on our business. We have not incurred substantial costs to comply with any environmental protection laws or regulations, and we do not anticipate having to do so in the foreseeable future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property If we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property protection for our OLED technologies and materials, our business will suffer. The value of our OLED technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. Although we own or license many patents respecting our OLED technologies and materials that have already been issued, there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained, or that any of these patents, once issued, will afford commercially significant protection for our OLED technologies and materials, or will be found valid if challenged. Also, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending the validity of our current or future patents in pending and future patent oppositions, invalidation trials, interferences, reexaminations, reissues, or other administrative or court proceedings. Moreover, we have not obtained patent protection for some of our OLED technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which OLED products or materials might be manufactured or sold. We believe that the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent OLED devices and certain materials utilized in these devices. Certain of our existing fundamental phosphorescent OLED patents expired in the United States in 2017 and 2019; and expired in other countries of the world in 2018 and 2020. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications relating to our commercial OLED materials and technologies whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend) beyond 2020, many of which are also of importance in the OLED industry, none may be of an equally essential nature as our original fundamental patents, and therefore our competitive position may be less certain as a result of the expiration of these patents. We have more than 5,000 issued and pending patents relating to our OLED technologies. There is no assurance that these patents and applications will not be challenged prior to their respective expirations in any of the jurisdictions in which they are utilized, or that if challenged, we will be able to secure sufficient breadth of protection, and monetary and injunctive relief for the violation of our rights to make up for the business harm resulting from such activities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or produce competing PHOLED material designs that may be outside of our existing patents. There may also be fundamental new advancements in the field of OLED technology that could enable the commercial use of older and unpatented PHOLED materials or the adoption of new OLED materials that do not require the utilization of our proprietary PHOLED materials to achieve superior performance characteristics. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees. In addition, we are participating in or have participated in, and in the future will likely have to participate in, interference, reissue, or reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and opposition, nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices, with respect to some of our patents or patent applications. All of these actions place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention from our business and operations. Moreover, if successful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key OLED technologies and materials on which our business depends. We rely, in part, on several non-patented proprietary technologies to operate our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Furthermore, these parties may obtain patent protection for such technology, inhibiting or preventing us from practicing the technology. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other non-patented proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other non-patented proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. 17 Additionally, although we take many measures and implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, including by theft and misuse, of our intellectual property and proprietary information, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, reverse-engineer, use or disclose, illegally or otherwise, such intellectual property and proprietary information. We also may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems or to our intellectual property, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company or its products. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and proprietary information, it will harm our business. We or our customers may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights or with respect to our OLED materials business. There are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials, including, without limitation, Kodak (substantially all of whose OLED assets were sold to a group of LG companies in 2009), CDT (acquired by Sumitomo in 2007), Canon, Inc., Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co., Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In addition, some of our customers such as SDC and LG Display have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials. As a result, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our OLED technologies or materials, thus subjecting our customers to possible suits for patent infringement in the future. Such lawsuits could result in our customers being liable for damages or require our customers to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ sales and thus our royalties or material sales revenues, or cause our customers to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates or pricing. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify customers purchasing our OLED materials for commercial usage against certain claims of patent infringement by third parties, as a result of which we may incur substantial legal costs in connection with defending these customers from such claims. Our licensees may also seek to avoid paying future royalties by attempting to have our patents declared invalid and unenforceable by a court. Our licensees may be more likely to file such declaratory actions in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc . (2007), in which the Court found that a licensee need not refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before bringing an action to declare a licensed U. S. patent invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we may be required, from time-to-time, to assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence. Defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable. Thus, any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable. If a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents, that party and others could compete more effectively against us. Our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents would also be adversely affected. Whether our customers are defending the assertion of third-party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology, or we are asserting our own intellectual property rights against others, such litigation can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to our or our customers’ business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. As a result, the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our customers are subject could disrupt business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our customers to significant liabilities, each of which could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials continue to enter the consumer marketplace. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages. Any intellectual property litigation commenced against our customers may force them to take actions that could be harmful to their businesses and thus to revenues, including the halting of sales of products that incorporate or otherwise use our technology or materials. Furthermore, the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex and is often subjective or uncertain. If our customers were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party, the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict. Decreased sales of our customers’ products incorporating our technology or materials would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses and material sales under our existing sales agreements. Were this to occur, it would likely harm our ability to (i) obtain new licensees which would have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees, and (ii) sell our UniversalPHOLED® materials to existing and new customers. Moreover, to the extent any third party claims are directed specifically to materials supplied by us to our customers, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with the defense of such claims and potential damages associated with such claims that may be awarded against our customers. 18 As is commonplace in technology companies, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. To the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. The costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our customers’ businesses could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail. Recent court decisions in various patent cases may make it more difficult for us to obtain future patents, enforce our patents against third parties or obtain favorable judgments in cases where the patents are enforced. Recent case law may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents. For example, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc . (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court mandated a more expansive and flexible approach to determine whether a patent is obvious and invalid. As a result of the less rigid approach to assessing obviousness, defending the validity of or obtaining patents may be more difficult. Recent court decisions may also impact the enforcement of our patents. For example, we may not be able to enjoin certain third party uses of products or methods covered by our patents following the initial authorized sale, even where those uses are expressly proscribed in an agreement with the buyer. Also, we may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement of our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an injunction should not automatically issue based on a finding of patent infringement, but should be determined based on a test balancing considerations of the patentee’s interest, the infringer’s interest, and the public’s interest. Obtaining enhanced damages for willful infringement of our patents may also be more difficult even in those cases where we successfully prove a third party has infringed our patents, as a recent case set a more stringent standard for proving willful infringement. Therefore, as a result of such rulings, it may be more difficult for us to defend our currently issued patents, obtain additional patents in the future or achieve the desired competitive effect even when our patents are enforced. If we are unable to so defend our currently issued patents, or to obtain new patents for any reason, our business would suffer. Risks Related to Our Business and Operations If we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with OLED product manufacturers, our business strategy will fail. Our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high-volume manufacturers of OLED products. We have entered into a limited number of such relationships from which most of our material sales and licensing revenue are generated. Our other relationships with product manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial products. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the product manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us. Many of our agreements with product manufacturers last for only limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these manufacturers will expire unless they are renewed. These product manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis or may agree to do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we regularly continue working with product manufacturers after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with the various product manufacturers not continue or be renewed on less favorable terms, or if we are not able to identify other product manufacturers and enter into contracts with them, our business may materially suffer. Our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing relationships, may depend on our ability to make certain financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail. If we fail to continue to make advances in our OLED research and development activities, we might not succeed in continuing to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. Further advances in our OLED technologies and materials depend, in part, on the success of the research and development work we conduct, both alone and with our research partners. We cannot be certain that this work will yield additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials. 19 Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete research and development of our OLED technologies and materials successfully, or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our OLED technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. Conflicts or other problems may arise with our customers or joint development partners, resulting in renegotiation, breach or termination of, or litigation related to, our agreements with them. This would adversely affect our revenues. Conflicts or other problems could arise between us and our customers or joint development partners, some of which we have made strategic investments in, as to royalty rates, milestone payments or other commercial terms. Similarly, we may disagree with our customers or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non-commercial terms. If such a conflict were to arise, a customer or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely, and we might lose the royalty revenues, material sales revenues and other benefits of the agreement. Either we or the customer or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations, establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement. Such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management. If we were unsuccessful in such litigation, we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement, be liable for financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute. If our OLED technologies and materials are not feasible for broad-based product applications, we may not be able to continue to generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our main business strategy is to sell our OLED materials and license our OLED technologies to manufacturers for incorporation into the display and lighting products that they sell. Consequently, our success depends on the ability and willingness of manufacturers to continue to develop, manufacture and sell commercial products integrating our technologies and materials. Before product manufacturers will agree to expand the use of our OLED technologies and materials for wider scale commercial production, they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our OLED technologies and materials are feasible for broad-based product applications beyond current commercial application, such as smartphones, wearables and television displays. This, in turn, may require additional advances in our technologies and materials, as well as those of others, for applications in a number of areas, including, without limitation, advances with respect to the development of: • OLED materials with improved lifetimes, efficiencies and color coordinates for larger area full-color OLED displays and general lighting products; • more robust OLED materials for use in more demanding large-scale manufacturing environments; and • scalable and cost-effective methods and technologies for the fabrication of large volume OLED materials and products. We cannot be certain that these advances will occur, and hence our OLED technologies and materials may not be feasible for additional broad-based product applications and expansion. Even if our OLED materials and technologies are technically feasible, they may not be further adopted by product manufacturers for broad-based product applications. The potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us remain uncertain. Market acceptance of our OLED materials and technologies beyond current product offerings and sales volumes will depend, in part, upon these materials and technologies providing benefits comparable or superior to competing display and lighting technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers, and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers. Many current and potential customers for our OLED technologies utilize and have invested significant resources in competing technologies, and may, therefore, be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our OLED technologies. During the entire product development process for a new product, we face the risk that our materials or technologies will fail to meet the manufacturer’s technical, performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology. Even if we offer materials and technologies that are satisfactory to a product manufacturer, the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our materials or technologies. In addition, our agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials, and those customers may elect not to purchase our host materials. 20 Mass production of new mass market OLED products will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment, components and materials, many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, there may be a number of other technologies that manufacturers need to utilize in conjunction with our OLED technologies in order to bring these new OLED products to the market. Thus, even if our OLED technologies are a viable alternative to competing approaches, if product manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components, materials and other technologies, they may not utilize our OLED technologies. There are numerous potential alternatives to OLEDs, which may limit our ability to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. The display market is currently, and will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by displays based on LCD technology. Numerous companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs; additionally, other competing display technologies have been, or are being, developed. A similar situation exists in the solid-state lighting market, which is currently dominated by LED products. Advances in any of these various technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies in their field, either of which could limit the potential market for products utilizing our OLED technologies and materials. This, in turn, would cause product manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us, or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us. Other OLED technologies may be more successful or cost-effective than ours, which may limit the commercial adoption of our OLED technologies and materials. Our competitors have developed and continue to develop OLED technologies that differ from or compete with our OLED technologies. In particular, competing fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLED technology may become a viable alternative to our phosphorescent OLED technology. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new OLED technologies that may become more cost-effective or have fewer limitations than our OLED technologies. If our OLED technologies, and particularly our phosphorescent OLED technology, are unable to continue to capture a substantial portion of the OLED product market, our business strategy may fail. The consumer electronics industry experiences significant downturns from time to time, any of which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our OLED technologies and materials. Our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our customers to manufacture and sell products utilizing our technologies and materials, specifically our phosphorescent emitters and host materials, and the widespread acceptance of our customers’ products in the consumer marketplace. Any slowdown in the demand for our customers’ products or a decrease in our customers’ use of or demand for our materials would adversely affect our material sales and royalty revenues and thus our business. Our customers’ decrease in the use of or demand for our materials may depend on several factors, including pricing, availability, continued technical improvements and competitive product offerings. The markets for flat panel displays and lighting products are highly competitive. Success in the market for end-user products that may integrate our OLED technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our customers and us, including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end-user markets that our customers serve, as well as industry and general economic conditions. The markets that we hope to penetrate have experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Our business strategy is dependent on manufacturers building and selling products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for displays and solid-state lighting products could cause significant harm to our business. Our customers may develop new or more efficient manufacturing processes, which may adversely affect demand for our OLED materials. By developing enhanced material processing methods and more efficient manufacturing techniques, our customers who purchase our phosphorescent emitter and host materials could become more efficient in the utilization of our materials by developing designs that require less materials on a per square meter basis, or by modifying their manufacturing process to make more efficient use of our materials, which could limit or reduce the amount of materials they purchase from us. Thus, demand for our materials may not expand in proportion to the number of OLED related products manufactured by our customers, and may result in reduced demand for our materials and technologies relative to our customers' manufacture and sale of products made with such materials. 21 The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we expect it to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our operations and business. Any similar future epidemic or pandemic could also have such an effect. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. We expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees and communities, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, including working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel . In the future, we may face closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods of time due to, among other factors, evolving and increasingly stringent governmental restrictions including public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures. In addition, many of our customers may reduce their operations, as demand for their products becomes negatively affected, which would adversely impact our revenues from these customers. As a result, we would expect our financial results to be materially adversely impacted. In addition, consumer spending generally may also be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impact of any recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales for our customers and may also have an impact on their development of new products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees. This policy may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business, and have material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is highly uncertain and difficult to predict, as information is rapidly evolving with respect to the duration and severity of the pandemic. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, or its overall impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Should there be in the future any similar epidemic or pandemic that harms the global economy in general, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience impacts to certain of our customers as a result of health epidemic or other outbreak occurring in one or more locations, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any downturn in U.S. or global economic conditions may have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been significant and sustained economic downturns in the U.S. and globally in the past. These downturns have placed pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had a material adverse effect on the demand for consumer electronic products. Similar downturns in the future may have a significant adverse effect on one or more of our licensees as an enterprise, which could result in those licensees reducing their efforts to commercialize products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Consumer demand and the condition of the display and lighting industries may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, epidemics and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the demand for our customers’ products, and thus our business. Many of our competitors have greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them. The display and solid-state lighting industries are characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and research capabilities than we do. Because of these differences, we may never be able to compete successfully in these markets or maintain any competitive advantages we are able to achieve over time. If we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow, our business might not succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical and managerial personnel, and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to these and our other employees. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key technical or managerial personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. 22 Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is intense. We might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail. We rely solely on PPG to manufacture the OLED materials we use and sell to product manufacturers. Our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary OLED materials for our own use and for sale to product manufacturers. Our agreement with PPG provides us with a source for these materials for development, evaluation and commercial purposes. Our agreement with PPG currently runs through the end of 2021 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Our inability to continue obtaining these OLED materials from PPG or another source at cost-competitive prices and to continue obtaining these OLED materials in sufficient quantities to meet our product manufacturers' current and future demands and timetables would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cost of goods sold relating to sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers, as well as on our ability to perform future development work. Additionally, PPG manufactures our materials at its facilities based in the United States. As a result, such materials may be subject to tariffs or other barriers from or to countries where some of our product manufacturer customers have operations and to where we would need to ship product. We strive to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to accommodate our manufacturing customers. Inventory management relating to our material sales is complex, and excess inventory may harm our business and cause it to suffer. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels of our OLED materials to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As a just-in-time supplier to our customers, we carry sufficient inventory to accommodate their capacity requirements, sometimes without firm purchase commitments. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers to provide our materials to us exposes us to longer lead times than if we were a direct manufacturer, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively. Our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply and demand of their products by end-users, or the supply and demand of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them. Inventory management risks are heightened when our largest customers launch new products and retire existing products. At such times, these customers tend to change product designs and may introduce some of our new materials into new designs. The production of these materials requires us to purchase essential raw material and commence manufacturing well in advance of receiving firm customer orders for such materials. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of unanticipated changes in our customers’ manufacturing plans and designs. Unanticipated product cessation and product introduction delays or cancellation may cause us to order or produce excess or insufficient inventory. Excess inventory of our OLED materials is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and inventory write-downs. We are the sole source supplier for certain critical components used in OLED technologies, which subjects customers to risk if we are unable to meet the demand for such components. Our customers depend on us as the sole source for certain proprietary PHOLED materials used in manufacturing OLED products, which makes them susceptible to supply shortages if we are unable to meet their demand for such components. A potential customer could be hesitant to adopt OLED technology given the risks inherent in depending on a sole source for critical components and the inability to establish alternate supply relationships. If we are unable to supply the components needed by our existing customers in a timely manner, or if potential customers do not utilize OLED technology because of concerns about our ability to meet supply demands, our business may materially suffer. Because the vast majority of OLED product manufacturers are located in the Asia-Pacific region, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations. Many of our customers and prospective customers have a majority of their operations in countries other than the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and revenue outside the United States represents a majority of our total net revenue. We also have offices in various countries located outside of the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include, without limitation: • compliance with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including foreign anti-corruption laws and certain registration requirements for the OLED materials we sell; 23 • legal uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers; • economic instability in the countries of our customers, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our royalties; • political instability in the countries in which we and/or our customers operate, particularly in South Korea relating to its disputes with and proximity to North Korea, in Hong Kong relating to anti-government protests and in Taiwan relating to its disputes with China; • third party theft or compromise of our products, technology, data or intellectual property, including by means of counterfeiting or reverse-engineering; • difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; • potentially adverse tax and tariff consequences; and • trade conflicts between and among various geopolitical factions. Any of these factors could impair our ability to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials, thereby harming our business. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. We rely on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. We are dependent on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit important data and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third-party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors, that could adversely affect our business. Natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or earthquakes, particularly in Asia-Pacific region, where many of our customers are located, or the occurrence of other unforeseen catastrophic events, such a fire or flood, could unfavorably affect our business and financial performance. Such events could unfavorably affect our customers in many ways, such as causing physical damage to one or more of their properties, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more plants, the disruption or cessation of manufacturing of product lines, and the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or demand for their products. A resulting by-product of such natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could be a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of or demand for our products. Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Tax Matters We may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose additional compliance costs and that could negatively impact our business. Changes in environmental laws or regulations of our products could result in higher operating and compliance expenses and limit the markets in which we can manufacture and to which we can export our products. Changes in environmental laws or regulations, including laws relating to manufacturing operations and export restrictions, also could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and an increase in raw materials costs, and could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial condition. 24 The U.S. government has rights to intellectual property derived from our government-funded work that might prevent us from realizing the full benefits of our intellectual property portfolio. The U.S. government, through various government agencies, has provided and continues to provide funding to us, Princeton, USC and Michigan for work related to certain aspects of our OLED technologies. Because we have been provided with this funding, the government has rights to any intellectual property derived from this work that could restrict our ability to market OLED products to the government for military and other applications, or to license this intellectual property to third parties for commercial applications. Moreover, if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of this intellectual property in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government could require us to license this intellectual property to other parties in that field of use. Any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain maximum value from our intellectual property portfolio. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. In December 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code, was signed into law. While we believe that this law generally will have a favorable effect on U.S. corporations and their shareholders, uncertainty remains regarding the full effect that this law will have on us, particularly given the global nature of our operations, or the impact on our customers, vendors, shareholders and other stakeholders. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and business operations, and adversely impact our shareholders. Occasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. Risks Related to Our Stock and Capitalization We may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business. Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We may require additional funding in the future for the research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs. When we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain more money when needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or depositary shares, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these shares will dilute our then-existing shareholders. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies, particularly other emerging-growth companies in the technology industry. We have included in the section of this report entitled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” a table indicating the high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market for the past two years. Factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future: • our revenues, expenses and operating results; • announcements by us, by our customers, or our competitors of technological developments, new product applications or contractual arrangements; • announcements relating to dividends and share repurchases; and 25 • other factors affecting the display and solid-state lighting industries in general. Our operating results may have significant period-to-period fluctuations, which would make it difficult to predict our future performance. Due to the current stage of commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, current geopolitical risks, the limited number of commercially successful consumer products utilizing our OLED technologies that customers have introduced in the marketplace, the relatively short product lifetimes of these consumer products, and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our customers must achieve for the widespread inclusion of our OLED technologies in consumer products such as mobile phones, tablets, television displays and lighting products, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time. Among other factors affecting our period-to-period results, our license and technology development fees often consist of large one-time, annual, semi-annual or quarterly payments, which may result in significant fluctuations in our revenues. In addition, our reliance on a relatively small number of licensees with large volumes of consumer product sales makes our quarterly operating results subject to our licensees’ specific plans and the success of their specific product offerings. With respect to material sales, our sales are primarily dependent on purchases made by a relatively small number of customers. In addition to the other factors described above relating to our customers’ sales opportunities, our quarter-to-quarter sales may be materially impacted by our customers’ inventory management plans, which may vary substantially based on financial management considerations, changes in their product mix plans, modified material processing techniques and manufacturing line modifications. If, in some future period, our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price. Broad market, industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock. The price of our common stock could decrease if: • shares of our common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable, whether through an effective registration statement or based on Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or • we issue additional shares of our common stock that might be or become freely salable, including shares that would be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding stock options. We can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could: • adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of our common stock; • make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us; • discourage bids for our common stock at a premium; or • otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 18, 2021, we have issued and outstanding 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of Sherwin I. Seligsohn, our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past, none of which are currently outstanding, and may do so again at any time in the future. 26 Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In 2017, our Board of Directors began declaring quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have consistently paid since then and we intend to continue to pay in the future. However, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which current shareholders purchased their shares. Our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including takeover attempts. Our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates and the adult children of Sherwin Seligsohn, beneficially own, as of February 18, 2021, approximately 8.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these individuals may, as a practical matter, be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. This concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices and research and development laboratories are located at 375 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey. In 2004, we acquired the building and property at which this facility is located. During 2005, we conducted a two-stage expansion of our laboratory and office space in the building, as well as a recent expansion in 2013 and 2015. We currently occupy the entire newly expanded facility. In 2017, we acquired the building and property at which the Adesis facility is located at 27 McCullough Drive in New Castle, Delaware. In 2019, we purchased 250 and 300 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to our headquarters. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a 27 proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” in this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Item 1A of this report, entitled “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. 32 In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. ( Tianma ). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we suppl y phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Visionox’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, we have granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2020, Adesis employed a team of 100 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp), was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of our proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask (i.e., the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large-size OLED panels while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. 33 Further, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Our global operations, and the global nature of our customer base and their respective customers, expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on our operations and financial results during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect that as the pandemic continues to evolve, it can potentially have a further adverse impact on the results of our operations due to uncertainties involving the continued disruption of the global economy, uncertainties associated with consumer demand for finished OLED goods, and the potential resulting impact on our customers and their demand for our phosphorescent emitters. At this time, the crisis has not had a significant impact on our ability to fulfill shipments of commercial materials as required by our customers. However, the sustainability of maintaining our testing and manufacturing operations at levels needed to meet fluctuating customer demand is uncertain and is dependent upon the rapidly evolving situations being encountered by our logistics and supply chain partners. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we have taken proactive measures to adopt social distancing policies at all of our locations, employing nurses to check everyone entering our buildings, working from home, reducing the number of people in our sites at any one time, and suspending employee travel. While the ultimate health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly uncertain, we expect that our business operations and results of operations, including our revenues, net income and cash flows, will continue to be adversely impacted for at least the first half of 2021, including as a result of: • temporary closure of electronics and other retail stores through which our customers sell the products for which they use our technology and materials; • consumer confidence and consumer spending habits, including spending for the products that our customers sell and negative trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to consumers’ disposable income, credit availability and debt levels; • possible disruption to the supply chain caused by distribution and other logistical issues, which may impact suppliers of our raw materials as well as our ability to ship our materials to customers on a timely basis; • decreased productivity due to travel ban, work-from-home policies or shelter-in-place orders; • a slowdown in the U.S. economy, and uncertain global economic outlook or a credit crisis; and • uncertain trade restrictions amongst jurisdictions seeking to manage their respective exposure to risks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on navigating these recent challenges presented by COVID-19 through preserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions altering our business operations that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, or as required by federal, state, or local authorities. It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our customers, employees, and on our financial results for the 2021 fiscal year. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue and income taxes, as described below, are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the sale of our OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such 34 circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return . The rights and benefits to our OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. We believe that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. We estimate total material units to be purchased by our customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and our forecast process. Our management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, our management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of our customers over the contract term. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of our assessment we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2020, based on previous earnings history, a current evaluation of expected future taxable income and other evidence, we determined to retain the valuation allowance that relates to New Jersey research and development credits. Actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is generated in future periods. To the extent we establish a new valuation allowance or change a previously established valuation allowance in a future period, income tax expense will be impacted. 35 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2019 and 2018, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 filed on February 20, 2020. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (Decrease) Increase REVENUE: Material sales $ 229,749 $ 243,413 $ (13,664 ) Royalty and license fees 185,054 150,022 35,032 Contract research services 14,064 11,742 2,322 Total revenue 428,867 405,177 23,690 COST OF SALES 85,478 75,374 10,104 Gross margin 343,389 329,803 13,586 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 83,894 71,276 12,618 Selling, general and administrative 61,346 59,613 1,733 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 21,969 21,962 7 Patent costs 7,529 6,833 696 Royalty and license expense 11,125 11,776 (651 ) Total operating expenses 185,863 171,460 14,403 OPERATING INCOME 157,526 158,343 (817 ) Interest income, net 5,139 10,795 (5,656 ) Other income, net 864 767 97 Interest and other income, net 6,003 11,562 (5,559 ) INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 163,529 169,905 (6,376 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (30,157 ) (31,601 ) 1,444 NET INCOME $ 133,372 $ 138,304 $ (4,932 ) Revenue Our total material sales were $229.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $243.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of 6% with a commensurate decrease in unit material volume of 3%. The decrease in material sales was due to the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the global demand of OLED products utilizing our emitter material primarily during the second quarter of 2020. During the second half of 2020, OLED market conditions improved with our material sales demand returning to levels as those experienced prior to the pandemic as our customers’ demand cycles ramped up in preparation of new generations of mobile phones as well as the continued expansion in the OLED television market. Even though we believe we have experienced the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain uncertain as to the possibility of its re-emergence and corresponding negative impact on OLED market demand. • Green emitter sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, which include our yellow-green emitters, were $177.8 million as compared to $189.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 with unit material volumes decreasing by 2%. • Red emitter sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $51.0 million as compared to $53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 with unit material volumes decreasing by 6%. Revenue from royalty and license fees was $185.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $150.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 23%, as our customer’s sales of royalty bearing OLED licensed products strengthened in the latter half of 2020. Contract research services revenue was $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $11.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of 20%. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. 36 Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $10.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in manufacturing costs partially offset by a decrease relating to the lower amount of material sales. The increase in manufacturing costs was primarily due to higher costs incurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, associated with increased levels of product development required to meet our customer’s requests as they launched the next wave of new product introductions into the OLED market. We believe this is a temporary condition and manufacturing costs will return to previous trend-levels as the current product introductions are brought to market and begin to mature. Also included in the cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was an increase in inventory reserve of $1.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in revenue from royalty and license fees partially offset by a decrease in material sales and an increase in manufacturing costs, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $13.6 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreasing to 80% from 81%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $83.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $22.0 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in patent costs reflected higher internal patent prosecution related activities. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC, and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying sales. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income, net, was primarily due to a decrease in bond yields on available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2020 over amounts held during 2019. Other income, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net, of $864,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $767,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.4% and 18.6% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $30.2 million and $31.6 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the year ended December 31, 2020, without the $1.7 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 19.5% and $31.9 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2019, without the $3.0 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 20.4% and $34.6 million, respectively. 37 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $630.0 million and short-term investments of $100.0 million, for a total of $730.0 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $131.6 million and short-term investments of $514.5 million, for a total of $646.1 million, as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $148.8 million resulting from $133.4 million of net income and $136.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $121.2 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $192.4 million and an increase in other liabilities of $10.1 million, partially offset by an increase in inventory of $28.8 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $21.8 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $8.3 million and an increase in other assets of $7.0 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $193.9 million resulting from $138.3 million of net income and $139.5 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $83.9 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $157.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $15.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $12.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $109,000, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $28.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $17.3 million. Cash provided by investing activities was $391.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $238.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in cash provided by investing activities was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales and maturities of $419.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net purchases of $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and a decrease in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2020 was primarily due to improvements to our Ewing facilities in New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations during 2019. Cash used in financing activities was $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $9.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $1.6 million, a decrease in the repurchase of common stock of $649,000 and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $287,000. Working capital was $759.6 million as of December 31, 2020, compared to $630.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventory and accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in short-term investments. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings and public and private sales of our equity and debt securities. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. 38 Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2020, we had the following contractual commitments (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Estimated retirement plan benefit payments $ 93,808 $ — $ 12,366 $ 12,842 $ 68,600 Lease obligations 10,223 2,174 3,288 1,794 2,967 Purchasing obligations 13,721 13,721 — — — Research related obligations 7,687 3,721 3,966 — — Minimum royalty obligation (1) 500 100 200 200 $100/year Total (2) $ 125,939 $ 19,716 $ 19,820 $ 14,836 $ 71,567 (1) Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Princeton minimum royalties of $100,000 per year until the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement has no scheduled expiration date. (2) See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in our control. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those statements are attached to this report beginning on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in 39 the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based upon criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been attested to by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the following page. Steven V. Abramson President and Chief Executive Officer Sidney D. Rosenblatt Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 18, 2021 F-2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 18, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 18, 2021 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 18, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases. In addition, as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts As discussed in Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for organic light emitting diode (OLED) sales to customers with long-term contracts (i.e., over 1 year in length) using certain estimates. Revenue is determined by estimating total contract consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract and recognized based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. The estimated per unit fee includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees, as well as estimates of material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. F-4 The Company uses internal and external data to estimate material units to be sold and royalty consideration to be received over the contract terms. We identified the assessment of the estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts as a critical audit matter. The estimated per unit fee was dependent upon the estimates of total material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating the forecasted material unit sales and royalties, as changes in the estimates could significantly affect the estimated per unit fee. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s revenue recognition process, including the Company’s review and approval of forecasted quantities of material unit sales of OLED products and review of forecasted royalties. We assessed the Company’s forecasting policies and procedures and the inputs used in making the estimates by considering other reasonably likely outcomes when evaluating potential management bias. Additionally, we inspected the forecast calculations for a selection of OLED contracts and compared the per-material unit prices and royalty rates used against the respective contract terms. We compared the OLED material unit sales forecast to internal operating and production budgets, and we compared the forecasted OLED material unit sales and royalties to the results of inquiries of Company personnel, publicly available market data, and analyst reports. We assessed the Company’s ability to accurately forecast OLED material unit sales and royalties by comparing recent historical forecasts to actual results and evaluating the Company’s conclusions regarding the reasons for changes in the current year’s estimates as compared to prior estimates. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-10 UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis), UDC Ventures LLC and OVJP Corporation (OVJP Corp). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. In June 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary, OVJP Corp, was formed as a Delaware corporation. Based out of California, OVJP Corp was founded to advance the commercialization of the Company’s proprietary Organic Vapor Jet Printing (OVJP) technology. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities F-11 are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company’s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties and license fees. These receivables have historically been paid timely. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant risk of collection. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for credit losses would be required. The allowance for credit losses was $ 139,000 , $ 84,000 and $ 77,000 at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 30 years for building, 15 years for building improvements, and three to seven years for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any gain or loss is reflected in other operating expenses. Certain costs of computer software obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . Costs for maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to an existing system, are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Company management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31, 2020, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company’s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. Company management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If it is concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment assessment is not necessary. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, then its carrying value is written down to fair value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. If necessary, the F-12 second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. The Company performed its annual impairment asse ssment as of December 31, 20 20 utilizing a qualitative evaluation and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Adesis is great er than its carrying value. Company management believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fa ir value of the reporting unit. Future impairment tests will continue to be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs. As o f December 31, 20 20 , no indications of impairment exist ed . Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair values of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. As discussed in Note 8, effective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for leases in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases . At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgements include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. F-13 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial patent license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. F-14 In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. ( Tianma ). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company suppl ies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). In 2020, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with CSOT. Under these agreements, the Company has granted CSOT non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company also supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to CSOT for use in licensed products. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facility. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years . See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars F-15 at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the C onsolidated B alance S heets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity-based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment , eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2017-04, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new-forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, beginning on January 1, 2020, did not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. F-16 3 . CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit and U.S. Government bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2020 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 163,779 $ — $ — $ 163,779 Money market accounts 17,261 — — 17,261 U.S. Government bonds 448,970 6 ( 4 ) 448,972 $ 630,010 $ 6 $ ( 4 ) $ 630,012 December 31, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 119,272 $ — $ — $ 119,272 Money market accounts 12,355 — — 12,355 $ 131,627 $ — $ — $ 131,627 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2020 U.S. Government bonds $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 $ 99,929 $ 67 $ — $ 99,996 December 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ — $ — $ 700 U.S. Government bonds 513,577 190 ( 6 ) 513,761 $ 514,277 $ 190 $ ( 6 ) $ 514,461 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2020 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 466,233 $ 466,233 $ — $ — Short-term investments 99,996 99,996 — — F-17 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 12,355 $ 12,355 $ — $ — Short-term investments 514,461 514,461 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any credit losses on debt investments are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no credit losses on debt investments as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019. 5 . INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 Raw materials $ 46,843 $ 25,920 Work-in-process 9,904 7,987 Finished goods 34,844 30,046 Inventory $ 91,591 $ 63,953 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 1.1 million, $ 5.9 million and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. 6 . PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 Land $ 2,642 $ 2,642 Building and improvements 53,568 47,994 Office and lab equipment 85,881 74,726 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 8,921 7,592 Construction-in-progress 23,594 12,194 174,606 145,148 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 72,493 ) ( 57,276 ) Property and equipment, net $ 102,113 $ 87,872 Depreciation expense was $ 15.2 million, $ 12.5 million and $ 8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-18 7 . GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and developed intellectual property (IP) processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 Other 462 401 223,303 223,242 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 153,050 ) ( 132,468 ) Acquired technology, net $ 70,253 $ 90,774 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 20.6 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 20.6 million in the year ending December 31, 2021, $ 15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023, $ 9.6 million in the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025 and $ 4.9 million in total thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. F-19 Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At December 31, 2020, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2020 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 4,059 ) $ 6,461 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 1,428 ) 3,392 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 668 ) 832 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 16,840 $ ( 6,155 ) $ 10,685 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 1.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2021 - 2025) and $ 3.7 million in total thereafter. Goodwill As a result of the Adesis acquisition, the Company recorded $ 15.5 million of goodwill. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year unless events suggest an impairment may have been incurred in an interim period using Adesis’ standalone financial operating performance information. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires the exercise of judgment, including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit, as Adesis is considered to be the reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. As part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020, there were no significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Adesis had occurred. 8. LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. The Company adopted Topic 842 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company did not restate financial statement or lease disclosure data for periods prior to January 1, 2019, which was prepared in accordance with ASC Topic 840, Leases . The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 2,091 $ 1,855 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 1,948 $ 9,776 Operating lease cost was $ 1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 F-20 The following table presents the Company’s operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 Right-of-use assets $ 8,750 $ 8,482 Short-term lease liabilities 1,871 1,606 Long-term lease liabilities 6,879 6,876 The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: December 31, 2020 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 6.0 Weighted average discount rate 4.6 % As of December 31, 2020, current operating leases had remaining terms between two and eight years with options to extend the lease terms. Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2020, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2021 $ 2,174 2022 2,093 2023 1,195 2024 1,007 2025 787 Thereafter 2,967 Total lease payments 10,223 Less: imputed interest ( 1,473 ) Present value of lease payments $ 8,750 9. ACCRUED EXPENSES: Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 Compensation $ 22,147 $ 30,295 Royalties 11,125 11,776 Research and development agreements 5,029 3,052 Consulting 771 471 Professional Fees 908 268 Other 1,424 3,160 Accrued Expenses $ 41,404 $ 49,022 10. RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company has long-standing relationships with Princeton University (Princeton) and the University of Southern California (USC), dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to the Company’s OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Stephen R. Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Mark E. Thompson. Under an Amended License Agreement entered into in 1997 by the Company, Princeton and USC (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement), Princeton and USC granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of research performed by Princeton and USC for the Company. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company pays Princeton royalties of 3 % of the net sales price for licensed products it sells or 3 % of the revenues the Company receives from its sublicensees for their sale of licensed products. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 11.1 million, $ 11.8 million and $ 7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-21 In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred from Princeton to the University of Michigan (Michigan) and the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include Michigan as a party to that agreement. Also in connection with the transfer, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement with USC under which the Company continues to fund organic electronics research being conducted by Professors Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. The 2006 Research Agreement extends through April 2023 with an option to further extend for an additional two years . The Company makes payments under the 2006 Research Agreement to USC on a quarterly basis as actual expenses are incurred. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was obligated to pay USC up to $ 6.9 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term. The Company recorded research and development expense in connection with work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement of $ 1.2 million, $ 997,000 and $ 1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 11 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2021. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 2.8 million, $ 1.4 million and $ 771,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 12. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. F-22 Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had issued 49,013,476 shares of common stock, of which 47,647,828 were outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased no shares of common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 4,011 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $ 649,000 . Scientific Advisory Board Awards During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company granted a total of 1,926 and 1,960 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value of the shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.60 per common share, or $ 28.4 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On February 16, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $ 0.20 per common share to be paid on March 31, 2021 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 16, 2021. All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. F-23 13.

(2) Refer to Note 15: Employee Retirement Plans 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through December 31, 2020, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of December 31, 2020, there were 2,001,339 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Restricted Stock Award and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. F-24 The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock unit (RSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2020 98,810 $ 144.53 Granted 143,179 162.32 Vested ( 47,750 ) 136.59 Forfeited ( 1,615 ) 122.83 Unvested, December 31, 2020 192,624 $ 160.99 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSU awards granted was $ 162.32 , $ 168.95 and $ 115.48 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 7.7 million, $ 7.7 million and $ 8.1 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock award (RSA) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2020 311,643 $ 80.94 Granted 1,926 155.85 Vested ( 171,908 ) 50.65 Unvested, December 31, 2020 141,661 $ 124.81 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSA awards granted was $ 155.85 , $ 194.19 and $ 122.15 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSAs was $ 24.5 million, $ 28.4 million and $ 17.7 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to restricted stock awards and units issued to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 13.9 million, $ 10.0 million and $ 7.6 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 1.9 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 758,000 , respectively, and research and development expense of $ 4.3 million, $ 2.5 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 86,442 , 86,075 and 86,679 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 12.5 million, $ 14.0 million and $ 9.2 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 380,000 , $ 632,000 and $ 64,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.3 million, $ 916,000 and $ 4.3 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 6,456 , 9,332 and 25,000 shares during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized expense related to all restricted stock awards and units was $ 31.7 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.89 years. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a F-25 specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units will not vest at all. The following table summarizes the activity related to performance unit awards (PSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2020 37,781 $ 134.97 Granted 111,410 167.74 Vested ( 31,276 ) 105.65 Unvested, December 31, 2020 117,915 $ 165.48 During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company granted 95,772 , 10,096 and 40,601 performance units, respectively, of which 47,885 , 5,050 and 6,022 units, respectively, are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 47,887 , 5,046 and 6,025 units, respectively, are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and will vest over the terms as described above. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were also 15,638 , 15,650 and 28,554 incremental performance-based shares, respectively, that vested resulting from an increased vesting factor based on Company performance. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 167.74 , $ 198.72 and $ 119.62 during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all performance stock units, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 4.3 million, $ 1.7 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 670,000 , $ 208,000 and $ 141,000 , respectively, and research and development expense of $ 1.1 million, $ 419,000 and $ 330,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 12,877 , 16,668 and 25,208 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 1.9 million, $ 2.6 million and $ 2.9 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance unit awards was $ 12.9 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.12 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued 9,668 , 7,492 and 10,303 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 1.2 million, $ 889,000 and $ 798,000 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded charges of $ 96,000 , $ 79,000 and $ 82,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 111,000 , $ 73,000 , $ 81,000 , respectively, to cost of sales and $ 139,000 , $ 118,000 and $ 130,000 , F-26 respectively, to research and development expense, related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 15. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS: Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains the Universal Display Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan covers substantially all full-time employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to 90 % of their total compensation to the Plan, not to exceed the limit as defined in the Code. Once an employee is eligible to participate in the Plan, the Company will make a non-elective contribution equal to 3 % of the employee’s total compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company contributed $ 1.1 million, $ 880,000 and $ 1.2 million, respectively, to the Plan. Defined Benefit Plan On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment. As of December 31, 2020 there were seven participants in the SERP. The SERP benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and in certain cases, the participant's average annual bonus for the most recent three fiscal years ending prior to the participant's date of termination of employment with the Company for the life of the participant. For this purpose, annual base salary means 12 times the average monthly base salary paid or payable to the participant during the 24 -month period immediately preceding the participant’s date of termination of employment, or, if required, the date of a change in control of the Company. Under the SERP, if a participant resigns or is terminated without cause at or after age 65 and with at least 20 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. The benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and bonus for the life of the participant. This percentage is 50 %, 25 % or 15 %, depending on the participant’s benefit class. If a participant resigns at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit. If a participant is terminated without cause or on account of a disability after at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit in either case would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20 . In the event a participant is terminated for cause, his or her SERP benefit and any future benefit payments are subject to immediate forfeiture. The SERP benefit is payable in installments over 10 years, beginning at the later of age 65 or the date of the participant’s separation from service. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancy of the participant. This calculation is made as of the date benefit payments are to begin (later of age 65 or separation from service). If the participant dies after reaching age 65, any future or remaining benefit payments are made to the participant’s beneficiary or estate. If the participant dies before reaching age 65, the benefit is forfeited. In the event of a change in control of the Company, each participant will become immediately vested in his or her SERP benefit. Unless the participant’s benefit has already fully vested, if the participant has less than 20 years of service at the time of the change in control, he or she will receive a prorated benefit based on his or her number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. If the change in control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then each participant (including former employees who are entitled to SERP benefits) will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the benefit immediately upon the change in control. Certain of the Company’s executive officers are designated as special participants under the SERP. If these participants resign or are terminated without cause after 20 years of service, or at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, they will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. If they are terminated without cause or on account of a disability, they will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. The SERP benefit for special participants is based on 50 % of their annual base salary and bonus for their life and the life of their surviving spouse, if any. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life F-27 expectancies of the participant and their surviving spouse, if any. If they die before reaching age 65, the benefit is not forfeited if the surviving spouse, if any, lives until the participant would have reached age 65. If their spouse also dies before the participant would have reached age 65, the benefit is forfeited. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates, and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. In connection with the initiation and subsequent amendments of the SERP, the Company recorded cost related to prior service of $ 43.4 million as accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2020. The prior service cost is being amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average of the remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ending December 31, 2021 is $ 6.0 million. Information relating to the Company’s plan is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 51,117 $ 44,055 Service cost 1,092 969 Interest cost 1,285 1,613 Actuarial loss 25,033 4,480 Benefit obligation, end of year 78,527 51,117 Fair value of plan assets — — Unfunded status of the plan, end of year $ 78,527 $ 51,117 Current liability — — Noncurrent liability $ 78,527 $ 51,117 The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan was $ 74.2 million and $ 48.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. The large increase in actuarial loss was due to higher bonus cash payments in March 2020 with the associated bonus expense accrual recorded in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Service cost $ 1,092 $ 969 $ 1,301 Interest cost 1,285 1,613 1,047 Amortization of prior service cost 1,098 1,595 1,683 Amortization of loss 2,181 1,641 435 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 5,656 $ 5,818 $ 4,466 The measurement date is the Company’s fiscal year end. The net periodic pension cost is based on assumptions determined at the prior year end measurement date. Assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Discount rate 1.54 % 2.64 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Discount rate 2.64 % 3.82 % 3.22 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % F-28 Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over future years based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants, when the accumulation of such gains or losses exceeds 10 % of the year end benefit obligation. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost or credit) is included in the Company’s results of income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the net periodic pension cost in 2021 are as follows (in thousands): Amortization of prior service cost $ 1,099 Amortization of loss 4,936 Total $ 6,035 Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future service, are currently expected to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year Projected Benefits 2021 $ — 2022 5,945 2023 6,421 2024 6,421 2025 6,421 2026-2030 42,300 Thereafter 26,300 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 10 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 10 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and two employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into a New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 11) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 13.7 million, $ 22.0 million and $ 15.9 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally F-29 permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision is erroneous and appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. On appeal, the Appeals Division withdrew the lower Opposition Division’s rejections with respect to a portion of the original subject matter and remanded the matter to the lower Opposition Division for further consideration. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the opposition process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 17.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that has historically been recorded for the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018, 2019 and 2020 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 40.1 million and $ 26.9 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 32.7 million and $ 25.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. F-32 With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and research and development credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the December 31, 2020 and 2019 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In September 2020, the Korean District Court ruled entirely in the favor of UDC Ireland on the beneficial ownership issue. However, the KNTS has decided to appeal the ruling to the Korean High Court. The above estimates may change in the future and upon settlement. The Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which will be appealed based on the interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. The Company’s federal income tax returns for the years 2017 to 2020 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 to 2017 tax returns of UDC, Inc. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . 19. REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with one of its customers for emitters involving elements of variable consideration. Due to the escalation in trade policy tension between the governments of China and the United States, the customer required a larger than normal shipment of emitters having a right to return them through March 15, 2020 in order to accommodate their uncertain production needs. Per Topic 606, the Company was constrained to recognizing revenue on this unique shipment to the extent that it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and deferred recognition of the remainder until after the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved. These uncertainties included factors that were outside of the Company’s influence, including the customer’s production needs and complexities associated with the current international health and trade issues in China. On March 15, 2020, the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved as the customer did not exercise their right of return provision. This event resulted in the recognition of the previously constrained revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded 97 %, 97 % and 95 %, respectively, of its revenue from sales of material and 3 %, 3 % and 5 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis. F-33 Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of December 31, 2020 Accounts receivable $ 82,261 Short-term unbilled receivables 6,659 Long-term unbilled receivables 3,770 Short-term deferred revenue 105,215 Long-term deferred revenue 57,086 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2020 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022 . As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ 23.9 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 157,704 Increases due to cash received — ( 192,369 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 17,226 Unbilled receivables recognized 9,067 — Net change 9,067 ( 17,439 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 10,429 $ ( 162,301 ) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Deferred Revenue Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 133,394 Increases due to cash received — ( 157,321 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 1,632 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,834 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 1,492 ) — Net change 342 ( 22,295 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) The Company recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price of $ 17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $ 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Adoption of Topic 606 The Company adopted Topic 606 beginning January 1, 2018 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Under this transition method, the Company elected to apply Topic 606 only to contracts that were not complete at the initial adoption date. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $ 17.1 million on January 1, 2018. The new standard impacts how the Company recognizes revenue on its commercial license and material supply agreements with customers. Previously, the Company recognized license fees on a straight-line basis or as received from the customer, and royalty revenue one quarter in arrears based on sales information received from its customers typically received after disclosing that quarter’s results. Under the new standard, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units F-34 sold at its estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. 20 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Numerator: Net income $ 133,372 $ 138,304 $ 58,840 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 1,001 ) ( 1,106 ) ( 690 ) Adjusted net income $ 132,371 $ 137,198 $ 58,150 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 47,198,982 46,959,775 46,849,588 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 1,566 1,334 1,956 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 36,446 34,353 45,222 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 47,236,994 46,995,462 46,896,766 Net income per common share: Basic $ 2.80 $ 2.92 $ 1.24 Diluted $ 2.80 $ 2.92 $ 1.24 For the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none , none and 4,414 , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 2 1 . QUARTERLY SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED): The following tables present certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31, 2020.

EXPLANATORY NOTE The sole purpose of this amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 20, 2020, is to file a revised Exhibit 23.1, Consent of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, to the Form 10-K. As originally filed, the last sentence of the substantive paragraph set forth in Exhibit 23.1 mistakenly read: “Our report on the Consolidated Financial Statements refers to changes in the accounting for revenue and excess tax benefits from share-based payment transactions.” As corrected, such sentence now reads “Our report refers to a change in the accounting methods for revenue and leases.” No changes have been made to the Form 10-K other than the filing of the corrected Exhibit 23.1. This amendment does not reflect subsequent events occurring after the original filing date of the Form 10-K or modify or update in any way disclosures made in the Form 10-K. PART IV ITEM 15 .

BUSINESS Our Company We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), portable media device and automotive markets. We believe that this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. Our technology leadership, our current intellectual property position, and our more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable us to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and OLED lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. Our primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license our proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. We have established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through our internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. We currently own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. We manufacture and sell our proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. We also enter into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which we grant them licenses to practice under our patents and to use our proprietary know-how. At the same time, we work with these and other companies that are evaluating our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Market Overview The Display Panel Market Thin, energy-efficient display panels that can be manufactured on glass or flexible substrates are essential for a wide variety of portable consumer electronics products, such as mobile phones, AR/VR headsets, digital cameras, wearables, tablets and notebook computers. Due to their narrow profile and light weight, flat panel displays are the display of choice for larger product applications, such as computer monitors and televisions. Liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, continue to dominate the flat panel display market. However, we believe that OLED displays are an attractive alternative to LCDs, and OLED displays are gaining market share, because they offer a number of potential advantages, including: • higher power efficiencies, thereby reducing energy consumption; • a thinner profile and lighter weight; • higher contrast ratios, leading to sharper picture images and graphics; • wider viewing angles; • deposition on non-rigid substrates which enable conformable and flexible displays; • faster response times for video and gaming; and • lower cost manufacturing methods and materials. Based on these characteristics, product manufacturers have adopted small-area OLED displays for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables and tablets. Manufacturers are increasingly commercializing large-area OLED displays for use in televisions. We believe that if these efforts are successful, they could result in sizeable markets for OLED displays. 2 Organic materials make technically possible the development of flexible displays for use in an entirely new array of product applications. Such applications include display devices that fold in use, such as the Samsung Galaxy Fold released in 2019, or conform to various shapes for wearable, rollable, industrial and ruggedized applications. In addition, due to the inherent transparency of the organic materials and transparent electrode technologies, OLEDs eventually may enable the production of transparent displays for use in products such as automotive windshields and windows with embedded displays. The Solid-State Lighting Market Traditional incandescent light bulbs are inefficient because they convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into visible light, with the rest emerging as heat. Fluorescent lamps use excited gases, or plasmas, to achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of about 20%. However, the color rendering index of most fluorescent lamps – in other words, the quality of their color compared to an ideal light source – is inferior to that of an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent lamps also pose environmental concerns because they typically contain mercury. Solid-state lighting relies on the direct conversion of electricity to visible light using semiconductor materials. By avoiding the heat and plasma-producing processes of incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, respectively, solid-state lighting products can have substantially higher energy conversion efficiencies. There are currently two basic types of solid-state lighting devices: inorganic light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and OLEDs. Current LEDs are very small in size (about one square millimeter) and are extremely bright. Having been developed about 25 years before OLEDs, LEDs are already employed in a variety of lighting products, such as traffic lights, digital signage and billboards, replacements for incandescent lighting, backlights for smartphones, computer monitors and televisions, and as border or accent lighting. However, the high operating temperatures and intense brightness of LEDs may make them less desirable for many general illumination and diffuse lighting applications. OLEDs, on the other hand, are larger in size and can be viewed directly, without using diffusers that are required to temper the intense brightness of LEDs. OLEDs can be fabricated onto any suitable surface, including glass, plastic or metal foil, and could be cost-effective to manufacture in high volume. Given these characteristics, product manufacturers are working on and have introduced limited product applications of OLEDs for diffuse specialty lighting applications and ultimately general illumination. If these efforts are successful, we believe that OLED lighting products could begin to be used for applications currently addressed by incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, as well as for new applications that take advantage of the OLED form factor. In particular, the ability of OLED technology to produce uniform illumination over arbitrary shapes is making OLED lighting very attractive to the automobile industry as well as the digital signage industry. Our Competitive Strengths We believe that we currently are one of the leading technology developers in the OLED industry because we were the first company to develop and commercialize PHOLED emitter technology. Our experienced management and research teams have built an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our OLED technologies and materials, particularly with regard to PHOLED emitter materials, which we continually seek to enhance and grow. We work diligently, through the delivery of high-quality commercial products, superior technical support and customer service, to enable our industry-leading customers, which primarily are large display manufacturers, to adopt our OLED technologies and materials through implementation of long-term commercial material supply and patent and know-how license agreements. Our key competitive strengths include: Technology Leadership We are a recognized technology leader in the OLED industry. We, along with world-class academic partners Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), and the University of Michigan (Michigan), pioneered the development of our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technologies, which can be used to produce OLEDs that are up to four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs, which are illuminated using backlights. We believe that our PHOLED technologies and materials will continue to be well-suited for industry usage in the commercial production of OLED displays and lighting products. Through our internal, innovative research, which has produced the majority of our most critical commercial technologies, our relationships with supplier companies, such as PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and our existing and new academic partners, we believe that we can continue to advance the technology we have already developed and commercialized, and that we will continue to discover and develop other important OLED technologies, as well as novel OLED materials, that will facilitate further adoption of our various OLED technologies by product manufacturers. To this end, we have completed construction of one, and are nearing completion of a second, state-of-the-art laboratory, or Application Center, near our larger customers in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe these Application Centers will provide us and our customers with the ability to more quickly evaluate, develop and bring to market our 3 newest OLED materials and technologies. We also are committing significant resources to explore the use of next - generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as organic vapor jet printing (OVJP) . Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property Generally, each of our commercial offerings is protected by multiple patents which can help us either to prevent or combat the introduction of counterfeit and/or knock-off products that could potentially impact the market demand for our OLED materials and technologies. Our strong patent and non-patented know-how portfolios in the areas of PHOLED emitter materials, complementary PHOLED materials, OLED device designs, and OLED manufacturing technologies are reflective of our continued commitment to innovate and invest. We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the OLED industry. Through our internal development efforts, acquisitions, and long-standing relationships with academic partners, research institutions and product manufacturers, we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. We continue to enhance and grow our OLED technology and materials patent portfolio organically through internal research and development, partnering with third parties, and by acquisition. We also continue to accumulate valuable non-patented technical know-how relating to our OLED technologies and materials. Leading Supplier of UniversalPHOLED® Emitter Materials and Related Technology Licensing We are the leading supplier of PHOLED emitter materials to OLED device manufacturers. The emitter material, which is designed to efficiently convert electrical energy to a desired wavelength of light, is the key component in an OLED device. Our manufacturing partner of over 20 years, PPG, continues to manufacture our materials for us, using proprietary manufacturing processes and know-how, which materials we then qualify to our exacting product specifications and resell on a just-in-time basis to OLED device manufacturers. We record revenues based on our sales of these materials to OLED device manufacturers. Our commercial supply agreements typically require our customers to purchase minimum quantities of our materials, which purchases can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or as a minimum percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. Our commercial supply arrangements allow us to maintain close technical and business relationships with these OLED device manufacturers purchasing our proprietary materials, and thereby further supports our technology licensing business. We do not directly manufacture or sell OLED display or lighting products. Instead, we enter into non-exclusive licensing arrangements with OLED device manufacturers, many of which also purchase our materials, that pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties based on their sales of licensed commercial products using our proprietary technology and patents. We believe this business model allows us to concentrate on our core strengths of technology development and innovation, while at the same time provides significant operating leverage. We also believe that this approach may reduce potential competitive conflicts with our customers. Long-Standing Customer Relationships We have long-standing customer relationships with OLED device manufacturers that are using, or are evaluating for use, our OLED materials in commercial OLED products. We have more than 20 years of experience in working closely with OLED device manufacturers and have provided support to them in their commercialization of OLED technology by delivering customer-specific solutions for red, green, and yellow emitter materials, or dopants. We have a proven track record of delivering consistent, high-quality OLED material to our customers. We provide just-in-time supply to our customers and serve as a sole source to them for many of our critical materials. We believe that our unparalleled manufacturing partners, namely PPG, our well-established supply chain, our multi-tier quality testing, and our product assurance protocols make us a preferred partner for our customers and for any large-scale OLED display manufacturer that wants to deliver to high-quality international end-customers. In 2019, our largest customers for our PHOLED materials included Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE), Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma), Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox), Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT), Shenzhen Royale Display Technologies Co. Ltd., Japan Display, Inc., Sharp Corporation, and AU Optronics Corporation (AU Optronics). Other licensed customers of our technology in 2019 included Kaneka Corporation, Pioneer Corporation, and OLEDWorks L.L.C. Complementary UniversalPHOLED ® Host Material Business In addition to our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® emitter materials, we continue to develop, supply and offer for sale certain of our proprietary phosphorescent host materials to OLED device manufacturers. In addition, we have entered into a number of host 4 material strategic partnerships through development agreements with OLED material partners that are focused on combinin g our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in order to optimize the performance of our emitters in our customers’ newest product designs. We do not believe that revenue from our host development and third-party collaboration agreements will be significant compared with our emitter business. However, we believe that development and collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring the continued success of the OLED industry and the broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies in the marketplace. Experienced Management and Scientific Advisory Team Our management team has significant experience in developing business models focused on licensing disruptive technologies in high growth industries. The team has strong relationships with, and deep understandings of, our customers and their needs, the commercial marketplace and the OLED industry on the whole. We believe our management team’s experience and long-standing relationships are important to maintaining good and accommodating working relationships with our customers, particularly when we are confronted with challenging technical, regulatory and trade issues given our international reach. In addition, we employ and contract with some of the leading researchers in the industry, and we maintain a long-standing Scientific Advisory Board that includes industry pioneers, namely Professor Stephen R. Forrest of Michigan (formerly of Princeton) and Professor Mark E. Thompson of USC. Our Business Strategy Our current business strategy is to continue to promote and expand our portfolio of OLED technologies and materials for widespread use in OLED displays and lighting products. We generate revenues primarily by selling our proprietary OLED materials and licensing our OLED technologies to display and lighting product manufacturers. We are presently focused on the following steps to implement our business strategy: Expand Our Collaborative Relationships with Leading Product Manufacturers and Developers We collaborate and partner with leading manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are commercial licensees of our OLED technologies and purchasers of our OLED materials. We also supply our proprietary OLED materials to manufacturers and developers of OLED displays and lighting products for evaluation and for use in product development and for pre-commercial activities, and we provide technical assistance and support to these manufacturers and developers to foster ongoing relationships and new commercial agreements. We concentrate on working closely with OLED device manufacturers and developers because we believe that the successful incorporation of our technologies and materials into commercial products is critical to their widespread adoption. Enhance Our Existing Portfolio of PHOLED Technologies and Materials We believe that a strong portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products is critical to our continued success, particularly as the utilization of PHOLED technologies and materials expands in the marketplace. Consequently, we are continually seeking to expand this portfolio through our internal development efforts, our collaborative relationships with existing and new academic and other research partners, and other strategic opportunities, such as funding early-stage startup companies whose technology may be synergistic to ours. Since the acquisition of the early fundamental research developed by our initial academic partners, Princeton and USC, in the late 1990’s, one of our primary goals has been and continues to be the development of new and improved PHOLED technologies and materials with increased efficiencies, enhanced color gamut and extended lifetimes, which are compatible with different manufacturing methods, so that they can be used by various manufacturers in a broad array of OLED display and lighting products. Develop Next-Generation Organic Technologies We continue to conduct research and development activities relating to next-generation OLED technologies for both displays and lighting products, including next generation emissive layer technologies and dry printing technologies such as OVJP, which we discuss in more detail below. We also are funding research by existing and new academic partners and research institutions on the use of organic thin-film technology in other applications. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to enable us to maintain our position as a leading provider of OLED and other organic electronics technologies and materials as new markets emerge. 5 Business and Geographic Markets We derive revenue from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Most manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are or might potentially be interested in our OLED technologies and materials are currently located outside of the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide on-the-ground support to these manufacturers, we have established wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong, as well as a representative office in Taiwan. We also have recently completed or are near completion of the construction of new Application Centers in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea, which we believe will allow our Asia-based display manufacturers to evaluate more quickly and incorporate our technology into their designs. Our wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland, UDC Ireland Ltd. (UDC Ireland), is responsible for all material sales worldwide (excluding the United States) and for licensing and managing intellectual property and undertaking certain other business transactions in all non-U.S. territories. In 2019, we received a majority of our revenue from three customers domiciled in the Asia-Pacific region, BOE, LG Display and SDC, each of which had revenue in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenue. Our business is heavily dependent on our relationships with these customers. Substantially all revenue derived from our customers is denominated in U.S. dollars. We generally enter into long-term agreements with our customers, which may include (1) a commercial supply agreement for the purchase of specific OLED materials, and (2) patent and know-how license agreements that relate to the manufacture of display and lighting devices. Generally, our commercial material supply agreements provide for multi-year purchase commitments, typically on a price per gram basis, which entitle our customers to certain discounts, technical support on the use of our OLED materials in mass production facilities, and access to certain future OLED materials. In order to secure preferential pricing and technology access, a customer typically agrees to certain minimum purchase obligations which can be in the form of absolute annual minimum purchase obligations or a percentage of their purchase requirements, or a combination of both. If a customer does not meet its minimum purchase obligations, generally we would have the right to review pricing for future material sales and impose other financial penalties. Our patent and know-how license agreements generally are made available to our customers for the manufacture of OLED devices. In addition, we also may license to certain material company partners the right to manufacture certain OLED materials that are complementary to our phosphorescent emitter materials. These licenses have included licenses to make host products and certain other non-phosphorescent materials. We believe it is in our, and our customers’ best interests to facilitate the development of materials that are complementary to our offerings and which assist our customers to produce more efficient and manufacturable devices with our materials. These collaboration efforts are likely to generate additional licensing fees for us under our license agreements. Although our customers generally pay us fixed license fees and/or running royalties for OLED licensed products that they manufacture, our material partner licensees generally pay us a portion of their sales for materials that are developed under material collaboration agreements and subsequently commercialized. To date, these material collaboration arrangements have not generated significant revenues for us. For more information on our revenues, costs and expenses associated with our business, as well as a breakdown of revenues from North America and foreign sources, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included elsewhere in this report. Our Technology and its Relation to OLED Technology and Structure OLED devices are solid-state semiconductor devices made from thin films of organic material that emit light of various wavelengths when electricity is selectively applied to the emissive layer of the device. OLED devices are typically referred to as incorporating an “OLED stack.” OLED stacks vary in specific structure but those commonly used today may include a cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, an emissive layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer and an anode, all of which are placed on a substrate which may be made of a number of different materials, including glass, plastic and metal. Our technology and materials are most commonly utilized in the emissive layer; the materials in the emissive layer are the light-generating component of the OLED stack. Many of our key technologies relate primarily to phosphorescent emitter materials, which 6 we believe are more energy efficient than fluorescent emitter materials that can also be used to generate light within the emissive layer of the OLED device. We began selling emitter materials commercially in 2003. A manufacturer will use a small amount of emitter material for each device through a process called “doping” into a host material. The emitter material(s) and the host material(s) together form an emissive layer system. Depending on the nature of the OLED device, the emissive materials and emissive layer system may be designed to emit different colors. We have commercially produced and sold phosphorescent emitter materials that produce red, yellow, green and light-blue light, which are combined in various ways for the display and lighting markets. Our current materials business, conducted outside the United States by UDC Ireland, is focused primarily on the delivery of such emissive materials. We have also developed host materials for the emissive layer and began selling them commercially in 2011. In addition to our materials, which are generally protected by patents covering various molecular structures, we also have fundamental and important patents that cover various aspects of the OLED device, device architectures, use of materials in devices and OLED manufacturing processes. These patents are important to our licensing business because they enable us to provide our business partners important OLED related technologies. Our PHOLED Technologies PHOLED technologies utilize specialized materials and device structures that allow OLEDs to emit light through a process known as phosphorescence. Traditional fluorescent OLEDs emit light through an inherently less efficient process. Theory and experiment show that PHOLEDs exhibit device efficiencies up to four times higher than those exhibited by fluorescent OLEDs. Phosphorescence substantially reduces the power requirements of an OLED and is useful in displays for hand-held devices, such as smartphones, where battery power is often a limiting factor. Phosphorescence is also important for large-area displays such as televisions, where higher device efficiency and lower heat generation may enable longer product lifetimes and increased energy efficiency. We have a strong intellectual property portfolio surrounding our existing PHOLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products which we market under the UniversalPHOLED® brand. We devote a substantial portion of our efforts to developing new and improved proprietary PHOLED materials and device architectures for red, green, yellow, blue and white OLED devices. In 2019, we continued our commercial supply relationships with companies such as BOE, LG Display, SDC, Tianma, and Visionox to use our PHOLED materials to manufacture OLED displays. In addition, we have worked and continue to work closely with customers evaluating and qualifying our proprietary PHOLED materials for commercial usage in both displays and lighting products, and with other material suppliers to combine our PHOLED emitters with their phosphorescent hosts and other OLED materials. Our Additional Proprietary OLED Technologies Our intellectual property, research, development and commercialization efforts also encompass a number of other OLED device and manufacturing technologies, including, but not limited to, the following: FOLED ™ Flexible OLEDs We are working on a number of technologies required for the fabrication of OLEDs on flexible substrates. Most other flat panel displays are built on rigid glass substrates. In contrast, FOLEDs are OLEDs built on non-rigid substrates such as plastic or metal foil. This has the potential to enhance durability and enable conformation to certain shapes or repeated bending or flexing. Many OLED smartphone displays are built on plastic substrates including those produced by SDC. One of our customers, LG Display, demonstrated several different rollable FOLED displays at the 2020 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas, NV. The commercial introduction of such FOLED product offerings demonstrates the viability of new display product applications that do not predominantly exist commercially today, such as portable, roll-up communications devices, as well as enhance the usefulness of such devices in ruggedized, industrial and wearable computing systems. Manufacturers also may be able to produce FOLEDs using more efficient continuous, or roll-to-roll, processing methods in the future. Our internal research and development efforts are expected to enhance and promote the future adoption of consumer and industrial FOLED devices. OVJP® Organic Vapor Jet Printing OLEDs could be manufactured using other processes as well, including OVJP. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large-area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask ( i.e. , the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. In 2019, we installed a new red-green-blue OVJP pilot tool at our Ewing, New 7 Jersey facility, and we continue to collaborate on OVJP technology development with Professor Forrest of Michigan. We believe the successful implementation of the OVJP technology has the potential to increase the addressable market for large - size OLED panel s while also serving another potential growth market for our proprietary PHOLED materials and technologies . Thin-Film Encapsulation We have developed proprietary, patented encapsulation technology for the packaging of flexible OLEDs and other thin-film devices, as well as for use as a barrier film for plastic substrates. Addressing a major roadblock to the successful commercialization of flexible OLEDs, our hybrid, multi-layer approach provides barrier performance useful for OLEDs using a potentially cost-effective process. In addition to potentially accelerating the commercial viability of flexible OLEDs, our thin-film encapsulation technology has the potential to provide benefits for a variety of other flexible thin-film devices, including photovoltaics and thin-film batteries. UniversalP 2 OLED® Printable Phosphorescent OLEDs The standard approach for manufacturing a small molecule OLED, including a PHOLED, is based on a vacuum thermal evaporation, or VTE, process. With a VTE process, the thin layers of organic material in an OLED are deposited in a high-vacuum environment. An alternate approach for patterning a small molecule OLED involves solution processing of the various organic materials in an OLED using techniques such as spin coating or inkjet printing onto the substrate. Solution-processing methods, and inkjet printing in particular, have the potential to be scalable to large-area displays. Our Strategic Relationships with Product Manufacturers We have established early-stage evaluation programs, development and pre-commercial programs, and commercial arrangements with a substantial number of manufacturers or potential manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products. Many of these relationships are directed towards tailoring our proprietary OLED technologies and materials for use by individual manufacturers. Our ultimate objective is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to these manufacturers for their commercial production of OLED products. Relationships with OLED Display Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to display manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. We have been collaborating with some of these display manufacturers for nearly 20 years. We have been working with SDC and providing our PHOLED materials to SDC for evaluation since 2001. Under the terms of a 2011 patent license agreement, we licensed our patents and technologies to SDC for its manufacture and sale of AMOLED display products. Under the terms of a 2011 supplemental purchase agreement, we supplied our proprietary PHOLED materials to SDC for its use in manufacturing licensed products. We also continue to supply SDC with our proprietary UniversalPHOLED materials for use in its development efforts under a 2001 joint development agreement. The 2011 license and purchase agreements with SDC expired on December 31, 2017, and on February 13, 2018, we entered into new patent license and supplemental purchase agreements, both with an effective date of January 1, 2018. These agreements, which cover the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, last through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under these agreements, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. These agreements convey to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. The 2018 supplemental purchase agreement provides for certain minimum annual purchase obligations of phosphorescent emitter material from us for use in the manufacture of licensed products. SDC is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for smartphones and other personal electronic devices and produces displays for a number of different smartphone and electronic device manufacturers. We have been working with LG Display and its affiliates for over 15 years. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. 8 LG Display is currently the largest manufacturer of AMOLED displays for large - area televisions and produces display panels for a number of different television manufacturers. In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma. Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE. Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox. Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with CSOT. We have been collaborating with CSOT in the area of OLED display product design and manufacture and expect to continue to do so. We have been collaborating with AU Optronics since 2001, and we continue to provide our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics under a 2016 commercial supply agreement through which AU Optronics also has certain license rights. We also continue to support numerous display manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, through evaluation arrangements in which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for limited scale commercial production, evaluation and for purposes of development, manufacturing qualification and product testing. Many of these strategic relationships have been in place for longer than a decade, and we continue to establish new relationships. Relationships with OLED Lighting Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to lighting manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. Many of these strategic relationships have also been in place for longer than a decade. Since 2004, we have been supporting Konica Minolta in its efforts to develop OLED lighting products. We continue to license our patents and technology to Konica Minolta under a 2008 OLED technology license agreement for its manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products that utilize our phosphorescent and other OLED technologies. We also continue to provide Konica Minolta with our proprietary PHOLED materials for its manufacture of commercial OLED lighting products under a 2011 commercial material supply agreement, and for evaluation purposes under a 2012 evaluation agreement. We also continue to license our OLED patents to Sumitomo under a 2015 OLED patent portfolio license agreement in which we granted Sumitomo a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing license to make and sell OLED lighting panels using a solution-based manufacturing process. Under the license agreement, Sumitomo may also purchase certain of our phosphorescent materials. We continue to supply LG Display with materials in connection with the OLED lighting business it acquired from LG Chem, Ltd. (LG Chem). This lighting business continues to generate commercial chemical sales and license fee revenues under a limited-term commercial sales agreement we signed with LG Chem prior to its acquisition. We continue to license our OLED patents, and to provide our OLED materials, to OLEDWorks for use in OLED lighting products under patent license and commercial supply agreements signed in 2015. We have also extended the rights under these agreements to OLEDWorks GmbH, the German company and facility that OLEDWorks acquired in 2015 from Philips Technologie GmbH. We continue to license our technologies and patents to Kaneka for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products, under the terms of a 2013 license agreement, and we continue to supply our materials to Kaneka under a 2014 commercial material supply agreement. We also have a license agreement for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products with Pioneer, among others. 9 Similar to our arrangements with display manufacturers, we continue to support numerous lighting manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, typically through evaluation agreements under which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for evaluation and potential commercial application. Relationships with Manufacturers for Other Commercial Products In addition to our relationships with lighting and display manufacturers, we have agreements and arrangements with manufacturers or potential manufacturers to use our proprietary OLED technologies and materials in other commercial products, such as in automotive interiors and exteriors. Our OLED Materials Manufacturing Business We supply our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® materials to display manufacturers, lighting manufacturers and others. These materials are produced in batch quantities by PPG to our exacting product specifications using our manufacturing process and know-how. We qualify each batch of emitters at our device qualification facilities to ensure that they meet required specifications, and we store qualified product inventory for delivery to our customers. We believe that our inventory-carrying practices, along with the terms under which we sell our OLED materials (including payment terms), are typical for the markets in which we operate. In 2018, our OLED materials business received recertification in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems. In 2018, UDC’s Ewing, NJ facility also received certification in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems. PPG We have maintained a close working relationship with PPG since 2000. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with PPG, the term of which continues through December 31, 2020 and is automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Under that agreement, PPG is responsible, under our direction, for manufacturing scale-up of our proprietary OLED materials, and for supplying us with those materials. We use these materials for our own research and development as well as for resale to our customers, both for their evaluation and for use in commercial OLED products. Through our collaboration with PPG, key raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis. We have not had any issues with obtaining access to adequate amounts of any key raw materials. Collaborations with Other OLED Material Manufacturers We continued our non-exclusive collaborative relationships with OLED material manufacturing customers during 2019. Most of these relationships are focused on combining our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies in an effort to optimize our PHOLED emitter products and deliver a high-performance system to the end customer. Our product manufacturing customers are not required to purchase host materials from us. As a result, we do not believe these collaboration efforts will generate significant revenue for us as compared to our emitter and licensing businesses. We believe, however, that collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring success of the OLED industry and broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies. Research and Development Our research and development activities are focused on the advancement of our OLED technologies and materials for displays, lighting and other applications. We conduct this research and development primarily internally and also through various relationships with commercial business partners, academic partners, and research institutions. We also have formed a venture capital company, UDC Ventures LLC, to invest in companies that we believe are developing synergistic or complementary technologies to ours. Internal Development Efforts Ewing, New Jersey Facility We conduct a substantial portion of our OLED development activities at our state-of-the-art development and testing facility in Ewing, New Jersey. At this expanded facility, which now exceeds 50,000 square feet, we perform technology development, including device and process optimization, prototype fabrication, manufacturing scale-up studies, process and product testing, characterization and reliability studies, and technology transfer with our business partners. Our Ewing facility houses multiple OLED deposition systems, including a full-color flexible OLED system and an OVJP system. In addition, the facility contains equipment for substrate patterning, organic material deposition, display packaging, module assembly and extensive testing in Class 100 and 100,000 clean rooms and opto-electronic test laboratories. Our facility also includes 10 state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical chemistry laboratories in which we conduct OLED materials research and make small quantities of new materials that we then test in OLED devices. Application Centers In addition to our laboratory facilities in Ewing, New Jersey, in 2019 we completed the construction of a new, leased, Application Center in Hong Kong, and we currently are in the process of constructing a new, leased, Application Center in Seoul, Korea. We believe these centers, which include state-of-the-art OLED laboratories, will better assist our Asia-based customers in their timely evaluation and adoption of our proprietary PHOLED materials, know-how and technologies in their respective PHOLED designs. Our Contract Research Organization Business: Adesis, Inc. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis). Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. Adesis currently operates in its headquarters facility, which it purchased in 2017 and consists of over 47,500 square feet in New Castle, Delaware and another, leased, 7,000 square foot facility in Wilmington, Delaware. As of December 31, 2019, Adesis employed a team of 94 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. Although we expect to continue to utilize the majority of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, Adesis is expected to continue operating as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries. University-Sponsored Research Princeton, USC and Michigan We have long-standing relationships with Princeton and USC, dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to our OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials for applications such as displays and lighting. This research, which generated many of the original fundamental PHOLED concepts and underlying patents that we commercialized, had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Thompson. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan, where we continue to fund his research. We funded research at Princeton under a research agreement executed in 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire in 2007, after Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan. We have exclusive license rights to all OLED and other thin-film organic electronic patents (other than for organic photovoltaic solar cells) arising out of research conducted under that agreement. In connection with Professor Forrest’s transfer to Michigan, in 2006 we entered into a new sponsored research agreement with USC under which we are funding organic electronics research being conducted by Drs. Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. As with the 1997 Research Agreement, we have exclusive license rights to all OLED and thin-film organic electronic patents (other than for organic photovoltaic solar cells) arising out of this research. Effective May 1, 2017, we amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years. As of December 31, 2019, in connection with this amendment, we are obligated to reimburse the universities up to $1.8 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. Other Academic Relationships We entered into a contract research agreement with the Chitose Institute of Science and Technology of Japan (CIST) in 2004. Under that agreement, we funded a research program headed by Professor Chihaya Adachi relating to high-efficiency OLED materials and devices. We were granted exclusive rights to all intellectual property developed under this program. Our relationship with CIST ended in 2006 when Professor Adachi transferred to Kyushu University. However, we have continued our relationship with Professor Adachi under a separate consulting arrangement. In 2006 and 2007, we entered into one-year research agreements with Kyung Hee University to sponsor research programs on flexible, amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology. The programs were directed by Professor Jin Jang. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into contract research agreements with Silicon Display Technology, Ltd. (SDT), a company founded by 11 Professor Jang, and in 2013, we entered into another one-year agreement with SDT. We continue to maintain a good working relationship with Professor Jang. As the utilization of PHOLED technology expands, we intend to further engage key researchers at other universities and research institutions to help identify additional fundamental technologies that could benefit PHOLED technology implementation. U.S. Government-Funded Research In the past, we have entered into U.S. government contracts and subcontracts to fund a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation OLED technologies concentrated primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. On contracts for which we were the prime contractor, we subcontracted portions of the work to various entities and institutions. All of the U.S. government contracts and subcontracts that we have entered into were subject to termination at the election of the contracting governmental agency. We do not believe that any of these U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Intellectual Property Along with our personnel, our primary and most fundamental assets are patents and other intellectual property. This includes more than 5,000 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense. It also includes a substantial body of non-patented technical know-how that we have accumulated over time. Our Patents Our research and development activities, conducted both internally and through collaborative programs with third parties, have resulted in our filing of a substantial number of patent applications relating to our OLED technologies and materials. These patents that we own represent, among other things, innovations beyond the original fundamental PHOLED conceptual patents that we license from Princeton, USC and Michigan, described below. Although many of these licensed fundamental conceptual patents have expired or will do so soon, our internal research efforts include essential innovations that have generated commercially viable implementations of the original PHOLED concepts and patents. As of December 31, 2019, we owned, through assignment to us alone or jointly with others, 478 pending U.S. applications (active U.S. cases and international applications designated in the U.S.) and 1,207 U.S. patents, together with 3,584 counterparts issued and pending in various foreign countries. These owned patents will start expiring in the U.S. in 2020. Patents We License from Princeton, USC and Michigan We exclusively license patent rights, including certain of our original, key PHOLED technology patents, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement that we entered into with Princeton and USC. In 2006, based on Professor Forrest’s transfer to Michigan that year, Michigan was added as a party to this agreement. The patent rights we license from these universities included 228 issued U.S. patents, 61 pending U.S. patent applications, together with counterparts filed in various foreign countries. The earliest of these patents began to expire in the U.S. in 2014, with the last of these key original patents expiring in 2020. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, Princeton, USC and Michigan granted us worldwide, exclusive license rights to specified patents and patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials (including our PHOLED technology and materials). Our license rights also extend to any patent rights arising out of the research conducted by Princeton, USC or Michigan under our various research agreements with these entities. We are free to sublicense to third parties all or any portion of our patent rights under the 1997 Amended License Agreement. The term of the 1997 Amended License Agreement continues for the lifetime of the licensed patents, though it is subject to termination for an uncured material breach or default by us, or if we become bankrupt or insolvent. Princeton is primarily responsible for the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent rights licensed to us under the 1997 Amended License Agreement pursuant to an inter-institutional agreement between Princeton, USC and Michigan. However, we manage this process and have the right to instruct patent counsel on specific matters to be covered in any patent applications filed by Princeton. We are required to bear all costs associated with the filing, prosecution and maintenance of these patent rights. We are required under the 1997 Amended License Agreement to pay Princeton royalties for licensed products sold by us or our sublicensees. These royalties amount to 3% of the net sales price for licensed products sold by us and 3% of the revenues we receive for licensed products sold by our sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the research agreements if Princeton reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these 12 products are not fair and competitive. Princeton shares portions of these royalties with USC and Michigan under their inter-institutional agreement. We have a minimum royalty obligation of $100,000 per year during the term of the 1997 Amended License Agreement. We owed royalties under the 1997 Amended License Agreement with Princeton of $11.8 million for 2019. We also are required under the 1997 Amended License Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if we invest a minimum of $800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to us under the 1997 Amended License Agreement. Acquired Patents and Other Intellectual Property From time to time we acquire patents and other intellectual property that we believe provide strategic business opportunities, such as the patent and technology portfolio we acquired from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Motorola, Inc.) (Motorola) in 2011, and the following portfolios from Fujifilm Corporation and BASF: Patents We Acquired from Fujifilm Corporation In 2012, we entered into a Patent Sale Agreement (the Fujifilm Agreement) with Fujifilm. Under the Fujifilm Agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $109.5 million. The Fujifilm Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The Fujifilm Agreement permitted us to assign all of our rights and obligations under the Fujifilm Agreement to our affiliates, and we assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement, our rights and obligations to UDC Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. Patents We Acquired from BASF In 2016, UDC Ireland entered into an IP Transfer Agreement (the BASF Agreement) with BASF. Under the BASF Agreement, BASF sold us more than 500 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $96.0 million. The transactions contemplated by the BASF Agreement were consummated on June 28, 2016. Intellectual Property Developed under Our Government Contracts We and our subcontractors have developed, and may continue to develop, patentable OLED technology inventions under our various U.S. government contracts and subcontracts, primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. Under these arrangements, we or our subcontractors generally can elect to take title to any patents on these inventions, and to control the manner in which these patents are licensed to third parties. However, the U.S. government reserves rights to these inventions and associated technical data that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications, or to third parties for commercial applications. In addition, if the U.S. government determines that we or our subcontractors have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these inventions in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government may require that we or our subcontractors license these inventions to third parties in that field of use. We do not believe that our current U.S. governmental contracts and subcontracts, or any inventions developed to date under these contracts and subcontracts, are material to our business. Non-patented Technical Know-How We have accumulated, and continue to accumulate, a substantial amount of non-patented technical know-how relating to OLED technologies and materials. Where practicable, we share portions of this information with display manufacturers and other business partners on a confidential basis. We also employ various methods to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, although no such methods can afford complete protection. Moreover, because we derive some of this information and know-how from academic institutions, there is an increased potential for public disclosure. We also cannot prevent the actual independent development of the same or similar information and know-how by third parties. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against alternative display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as other OLED technologies. We also compete in the lighting market against incumbent technologies, such as incandescent and fluorescent bulbs, and inorganic LEDs, and against emerging technologies, such as other OLED technologies. 13 Display Panel Industry Competitors Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing and improving LCD, which includes quantum dot LCDs (which are sometimes referred to as QLEDs), and other display technologies that compete with our OLED display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies can compete with LCDs, QLEDs and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video rates, form factor and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur. Lighting Industry Competitors Although there has been a movement to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs throughout many countries, traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps remain well-entrenched products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state LEDs have been introduced into the market and would compete with OLED lighting products. LEDs have realized significant market adoption in the general lighting market. Having attributes different from fluorescent lamps and LEDs, OLEDs may compete directly with these products for certain lighting applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might occur. OLED Technologies and Materials Competitors Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) developed and patented the original fluorescent OLED technology in 1987. Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd. (CDT), which was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company in 2007, developed and patented polymer OLED technology in 1989. Display and lighting manufacturers, including customers of ours, are engaged in their own OLED research, development and commercialization activities, and have developed and may continue to develop proprietary OLED technologies that are necessary or useful for commercial OLED devices. In addition, other material manufacturers, such as Sumitomo, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (Idemitsu Kosan), Merck KGaA, Cynora Gmbh and Kyulux Inc., are selling or sampling competing OLED materials to customers, including companies to which we sell our proprietary PHOLED materials. Our licensing business is based on our control of a broad portfolio of OLED-related device patents and technologies. We believe this portfolio includes fundamental patents in the field of phosphorescent OLED materials and devices, as well as certain additional complementary OLED technologies. As discussed above, alternative technologies, such as fluorescent OLED emitter materials, exist and could be competitive to our phosphorescent OLED material solutions. However, fluorescent materials have characteristics that we believe many market participants consider less desirable than those of phosphorescent materials. Suppliers of fluorescent emitter materials include Doosan Solus, Dow Chemical (previously Gracel Display), Idemitsu Kosan and SFC Co. Ltd. Fluorescent materials may also be viewed as complementary in that they can be used in the same OLED stack as phosphorescent materials. The competitive landscape with respect to our host materials business is characterized by a larger number of established chemical material suppliers who have long-term relationships with many of our existing customers and licensees. We have elected to partner with certain of these companies to manufacture and deliver host solutions to our customers, as well as selling our host materials directly to device manufacturers. We believe our competitive advantage stems, in part, from our deep knowledge of our phosphorescent emitter materials, which are complementary with the host solutions. We believe that our understanding of phosphorescent emitter materials enables us to create host material solutions that are especially well suited for use with a certain class of emitter materials that are implemented commercially today. However, we note that many of our technology partners have their own host solutions and the competitive landscape includes many well-established companies such as Doosan Solus, Dow Chemical, Duksan Neolux Co., Ltd., Idemitsu Kosan, Merck KGaA, NSCC and Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. These companies have significant resources, and some may aggressively pursue such business in the future. Our existing business relationships with SDC and other product manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve a significant level of market penetration in the display and lighting industries. However, others, such as those working to develop thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and micro-LED alternative technologies, may succeed in developing new OLED technologies, materials and alternative solutions that may supplement or be utilized in place of ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers will adopt and continue to utilize our OLED technologies and materials for the production of commercial displays and lighting products. 14 Our Venture Capital Business: UDC Ventures LLC We formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, UDC Ventures LLC, in March 2019, as a corporate venture capital entity that funds companies we believe are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic or complementary to our business and/or business strategies or which may otherwise provide favorable investment opportunities. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 309 active full-time employees and two part-time employees, none of whom are unionized. Of these employees, 217 are research scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians at our domestic and international facilities. This team includes chemists, physicists, engineers and technicians with physics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and organic/inorganic chemistry backgrounds, and highly-trained theoreticians and experimentalists. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Our Company History Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1985. Our business was commenced in 1994 by a company then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. functions as an operating subsidiary of ours and has certain overlapping officers and directors. We have also formed or acquired other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited (2008), Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (2010), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK (2011), UDC Ireland Ltd. (2012), Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. (2016), Adesis, Inc. (2016), and UDC Ventures LLC (2019) and we established a representative office in Taiwan (2011). Our Compliance with Environmental Protection Laws We are not aware of any material effects that compliance with Federal, State or local environmental protection laws or regulations will have on our business. We have not incurred substantial costs to comply with any environmental protection laws or regulations, and we do not anticipate having to do so in the foreseeable future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. If we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property protection for our OLED technologies and materials, our business will suffer. The value of our OLED technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. Although we own or license many patents respecting our OLED technologies and materials that have already been issued, there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained, or that any of these patents, once issued, will afford commercially significant protection for our OLED technologies and materials, or will be found valid if challenged. Also, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending the validity of our current or future patents in pending and future patent oppositions, invalidation trials, interferences, reexaminations, reissues, or other administrative or court proceedings. Moreover, we have not obtained patent protection for some of our OLED technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which OLED products or materials might be manufactured or sold. We believe that the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent OLED devices and certain materials utilized in these devices. Certain of our existing fundamental phosphorescent OLED patents expired in the United States in 2017 and 2019; and expired in other countries of the world in 2018 or will expire in other countries of the world in 2020. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications relating to our commercial OLED materials and technologies whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend) beyond 2020, many of which are also of importance in the OLED industry, none may be of an equally essential nature as our original fundamental patents, and therefore our competitive position may be less certain as these patents expire. We have more than 5,000 issued and pending patents relating to our OLED technologies. There is no assurance that these patents and applications will not be challenged prior to their respective expirations in any of the jurisdictions in which they are utilized, or that if challenged, we will be able to secure sufficient breadth of protection, and monetary and injunctive relief for the violation of our rights to make up for the business harm resulting from such activities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that competitors will not develop or produce competing PHOLED material designs that may be outside of our existing patents. There may also be fundamental new advancements in the field of OLED technology that could enable the commercial use of older and unpatented PHOLED materials or the adoption of new OLED materials that do not require the utilization of our proprietary PHOLED materials to achieve superior performance characteristics. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees. In addition, we are participating in or have participated in, and in the future will likely have to participate in, interference, reissue, or reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and opposition, nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices, with respect to some of our patents or patent applications. All of these actions place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention from our business and operations. Moreover, if successful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key OLED technologies and materials on which our business depends. We rely, in part, on several non-patented proprietary technologies to operate our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Furthermore, these parties may obtain patent protection for such technology, inhibiting or preventing us from practicing the technology. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other non-patented proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other non-patented proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. Additionally, although we take many measures and implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, including by theft and misuse, of our intellectual property and proprietary information, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, reverse-engineer, use or 17 disclose, illegally or otherwise, such intellectual property and proprietary information. We also may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems or to our intellectual property, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company or its products. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and proprietary information, it will harm our business. We or our customers may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights or with respect to our OLED materials business. There are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials, including, without limitation, Kodak (substantially all of whose OLED assets were sold to a group of LG companies in 2009), CDT (acquired by Sumitomo in 2007), Canon, Inc., Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co., Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In addition, some of our customers such as SDC and LG Display have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials. As a result, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our OLED technologies or materials, thus subjecting our customers to possible suits for patent infringement in the future. Such lawsuits could result in our customers being liable for damages or require our customers to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ sales and thus our royalties or material sales revenues, or cause our customers to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates or pricing. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify customers purchasing our OLED materials for commercial usage against certain claims of patent infringement by third parties, as a result of which we may incur substantial legal costs in connection with defending these customers from such claims. Our licensees may also seek to avoid paying future royalties by attempting to have our patents declared invalid and unenforceable by a court. Our licensees may be more likely to file such declaratory actions in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc . (2007), in which the Court found that a licensee need not refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before bringing an action to declare a licensed U. S. patent invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we may be required, from time-to-time, to assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence. Defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable. Thus, any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable. If a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents, that party and others could compete more effectively against us. Our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents would also be adversely affected. Whether our customers are defending the assertion of third-party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology, or we are asserting our own intellectual property rights against others, such litigation can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to our or our customers’ business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. As a result, the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our customers are subject could disrupt business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our customers to significant liabilities, each of which could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials continue to enter the consumer marketplace. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages. Any intellectual property litigation commenced against our customers may force them to take actions that could be harmful to their businesses and thus to revenues, including the halting of sales of products that incorporate or otherwise use our technology or materials. Furthermore, the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex and is often subjective or uncertain. If our customers were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party, the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict. Decreased sales of our customers’ products incorporating our technology or materials would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses and material sales under our existing sales agreements. Were this to occur, it would likely harm our ability to (i) obtain new licensees which would have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees, and (ii) sell our UniversalPHOLED® materials to existing and new customers. Moreover, to the extent any third party claims are directed specifically to materials supplied by us to our customers, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with the defense of such claims and potential damages associated with such claims that may be awarded against our customers. As is commonplace in technology companies, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. To the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the 18 alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. The costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our customers’ businesses could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail. Recent court decisions in various patent cases may make it more difficult for us to obtain future patents, enforce our patents against third parties or obtain favorable judgments in cases where the patents are enforced. Recent case law may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents. For example, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc . (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court mandated a more expansive and flexible approach to determine whether a patent is obvious and invalid. As a result of the less rigid approach to assessing obviousness, defending the validity of or obtaining patents may be more difficult. Recent court decisions may also impact the enforcement of our patents. For example, we may not be able to enjoin certain third party uses of products or methods covered by our patents following the initial authorized sale, even where those uses are expressly proscribed in an agreement with the buyer. Also, we may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement of our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an injunction should not automatically issue based on a finding of patent infringement, but should be determined based on a test balancing considerations of the patentee’s interest, the infringer’s interest, and the public’s interest. Obtaining enhanced damages for willful infringement of our patents may also be more difficult even in those cases where we successfully prove a third party has infringed our patents, as a recent case set a more stringent standard for proving willful infringement. Therefore, as a result of such rulings, it may be more difficult for us to defend our currently issued patents, obtain additional patents in the future or achieve the desired competitive effect even when our patents are enforced. If we are unable to so defend our currently issued patents, or to obtain new patents for any reason, our business would suffer. If we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with OLED product manufacturers, our business strategy will fail. Our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high-volume manufacturers of OLED products. We have entered into a limited number of such relationships from which most of our material sales and licensing revenue are generated. Our other relationships with product manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial products. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the product manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us. Many of our agreements with product manufacturers last for only limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these manufacturers will expire unless they are renewed. These product manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis or may agree to do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we regularly continue working with product manufacturers after our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with the various product manufacturers not continue or be renewed on less favorable terms, or if we are not able to identify other product manufacturers and enter into contracts with them, our business may materially suffer. Our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing relationships, may depend on our ability to make certain financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail. If we fail to continue to make advances in our OLED research and development activities, we might not succeed in continuing to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. Further advances in our OLED technologies and materials depend, in part, on the success of the research and development work we conduct, both alone and with our research partners. We cannot be certain that this work will yield additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete research and development of our OLED technologies and materials successfully, or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our OLED technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. 19 Conflicts or other problems may arise with our customers or joint development partners, resulting in renegotiation, breach or termination of, or litigation related to, our agreements with them. This would adversely affect our revenues. Conflicts or other problems could arise between us and our customers or joint development partners, some of which we have made strategic investments in, as to royalty rates, milestone payments or other commercial terms. Similarly, we may disagree with our customers or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non-commercial terms. If such a conflict were to arise, a customer or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely, and we might lose the royalty revenues, material sales revenues and other benefits of the agreement. Either we or the customer or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations, establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement. Such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management. If we were unsuccessful in such litigation, we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement, be liable for financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute. If our OLED technologies and materials are not feasible for broad-based product applications, we may not be able to continue to generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our main business strategy is to sell our OLED materials and license our OLED technologies to manufacturers for incorporation into the display and lighting products that they sell. Consequently, our success depends on the ability and willingness of manufacturers to continue to develop, manufacture and sell commercial products integrating our technologies and materials. Before product manufacturers will agree to expand the use of our OLED technologies and materials for wider scale commercial production, they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our OLED technologies and materials are feasible for broad-based product applications beyond current commercial application, such as smartphones, wearables and television displays. This, in turn, may require additional advances in our technologies and materials, as well as those of others, for applications in a number of areas, including, without limitation, advances with respect to the development of: • OLED materials with improved lifetimes, efficiencies and color coordinates for larger area full-color OLED displays and general lighting products; • more robust OLED materials for use in more demanding large-scale manufacturing environments; and • scalable and cost-effective methods and technologies for the fabrication of large volume OLED materials and products. We cannot be certain that these advances will occur, and hence our OLED technologies and materials may not be feasible for additional broad-based product applications and expansion. Even if our OLED materials and technologies are technically feasible, they may not be further adopted by product manufacturers for broad-based product applications. The potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us remain uncertain. Market acceptance of our OLED materials and technologies beyond current product offerings and sales volumes will depend, in part, upon these materials and technologies providing benefits comparable or superior to competing display and lighting technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers, and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers. Many current and potential customers for our OLED technologies utilize and have invested significant resources in competing technologies, and may, therefore, be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our OLED technologies. During the entire product development process for a new product, we face the risk that our materials or technologies will fail to meet the manufacturer’s technical, performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology. Even if we offer materials and technologies that are satisfactory to a product manufacturer, the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our materials or technologies. In addition, our agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials, and those customers may elect not to purchase our host materials. Mass production of new mass market OLED products will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment, components and materials, many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, there may be a number of other technologies that manufacturers need to utilize in conjunction with our OLED technologies in order to bring these new OLED products to the market. Thus, even if our OLED technologies are a viable alternative to competing approaches, if product manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components, materials and other technologies, they may not utilize our OLED technologies. 20 There are numerous potential alternatives to OLEDs, which may limit our ability to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. The display market is currently, and will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by displays based on LCD technology. Numerous companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs; additionally, other competing display technologies have been, or are being, developed. A similar situation exists in the solid-state lighting market, which is currently dominated by LED products. Advances in any of these various technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies in their field, either of which could limit the potential market for products utilizing our OLED technologies and materials. This, in turn, would cause product manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us, or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us. Other OLED technologies may be more successful or cost-effective than ours, which may limit the commercial adoption of our OLED technologies and materials. Our competitors have developed and continue to develop OLED technologies that differ from or compete with our OLED technologies. In particular, competing fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLED technology may become a viable alternative to our phosphorescent OLED technology. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new OLED technologies that may become more cost-effective or have fewer limitations than our OLED technologies. If our OLED technologies, and particularly our phosphorescent OLED technology, are unable to continue to capture a substantial portion of the OLED product market, our business strategy may fail. The consumer electronics industry experiences significant downturns from time to time, any of which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our OLED technologies and materials. Our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our customers to manufacture and sell products utilizing our technologies and materials, specifically our phosphorescent emitters and host materials, and the widespread acceptance of our customers’ products in the consumer marketplace. Any slowdown in the demand for our customers’ products or a decrease in our customers’ use of or demand for our materials would adversely affect our material sales and royalty revenues and thus our business. Our customers’ decrease in the use of or demand for our materials may depend on several factors, including pricing, availability, continued technical improvements and competitive product offerings. The markets for flat panel displays and lighting products are highly competitive. Success in the market for end-user products that may integrate our OLED technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our customers and us, including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end-user markets that our customers serve, as well as industry and general economic conditions. The markets that we hope to penetrate have experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Our business strategy is dependent on manufacturers building and selling products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for displays and solid-state lighting products could cause significant harm to our business. Our customers may develop new or more efficient manufacturing processes, which may adversely affect demand for our OLED materials. By developing enhanced material processing methods and more efficient manufacturing techniques, our customers who purchase our phosphorescent emitter and host materials could become more efficient in the utilization of our materials by developing designs that require less materials on a per square meter basis, or by modifying their manufacturing process to make more efficient use of our materials, which could limit or reduce the amount of materials they purchase from us. Thus, demand for our materials may not expand in proportion to the number of OLED related products manufactured by our customers, and may result in reduced demand for our materials and technologies relative to our customers' manufacture and sale of products made with such materials. We face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region, including the recent Coronavirus outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations and business. Our business could be adversely impacted by the effects of epidemic outbreaks such as the recent Coronavirus outbreak in Asia. With respect to the Coronavirus, several of our customers are located in the city of Wuhan in the People’s Republic of China, where the outbreak appears to have originated, and other locations throughout that country. We maintain Application Centers in Hong Kong, and also in Seoul, Korea, which are in proximity to the area of the outbreak. In addition, suppliers of raw materials required for the manufacture of our products are located in the Asia-Pacific region and may also be impacted by the outbreak. Consequently, we are susceptible to factors adversely affecting one or more of these locations. 21 Our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent an epidemic harms the global economy in general. We may also experience impacts to certain of our customers as a result of a health epidemic or other outbreak occurring in one or more of these Asia-Pacific locations, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our operations may experience disruptions, such as temporary closure of our offices and/or those of our suppliers, and temporary suspension of services, which similarly may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any downturn in U.S. or global economic conditions may have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been significant and sustained economic downturns in the U.S. and globally in the past. These downturns have placed pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had a material adverse effect on the demand for consumer electronic products. Similar downturns in the future may have a significant adverse effect on one or more of our licensees as an enterprise, which could result in those licensees reducing their efforts to commercialize products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Consumer demand and the condition of the display and lighting industries may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, epidemics and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the demand for our customers’ products, and thus our business. Many of our competitors have greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them. The display and solid-state lighting industries are characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and research capabilities than we do. Because of these differences, we may never be able to compete successfully in these markets or maintain any competitive advantages we are able to achieve over time. If we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow, our business might not succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical and managerial personnel, and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to these and our other employees. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key technical or managerial personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is intense. We might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail. We rely solely on PPG to manufacture the OLED materials we use and sell to product manufacturers. Our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary OLED materials for our own use and for sale to product manufacturers. Our agreement with PPG provides us with a source for these materials for development, evaluation and commercial purposes. Our agreement with PPG currently runs through the end of 2020 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Our inability to continue obtaining these OLED materials from PPG or another source at cost-competitive prices and to continue obtaining these OLED materials in sufficient quantities to meet our product manufacturers' current and future demands and timetables would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cost of goods sold relating to sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers, as well as on our ability to perform future development work. Additionally, PPG manufacturers our materials at its facilities based in the United States. As a result, such materials may be subject to tariffs or other barriers from or to countries where some of our product manufacturer customers have operations and to where we would need to ship product. We strive to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to accommodate our manufacturing customers. Inventory management relating to our material sales is complex, and excess inventory may harm our business and cause it to suffer. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels of our OLED materials to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As a just-in-time supplier to our customers, we carry sufficient inventory to accommodate their capacity requirements, sometimes without firm purchase commitments. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers to provide our materials to us exposes us to longer lead times than if we were a direct manufacturer, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively. Our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or 22 delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply and demand of their products by end-users, or the supply and demand of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them. Inventory management risks are heightened when our largest customers launch new products and retire existing products. At such times, these customers tend to change product designs and may introduce some of our new materials into new designs. The production of these materials requires us to purchase essential raw material and commence manufacturing well in advance of receiving firm customer orders for such materials. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of unanticipated changes in our customers’ manufacturing plans and designs. Unanticipated product cessation and product introduction delays or cancellation may cause us to order or produce excess or insufficient inventory. Excess inventory of our OLED materials is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and inventory write-downs. We are the sole source supplier for certain critical components used in OLED technologies, which subjects customers to risk if we are unable to meet the demand for such components. Our customers depend on us as the sole source for certain proprietary PHOLED materials used in manufacturing OLED products, which makes them susceptible to supply shortages if we are unable to meet their demand for such components. A potential customer could be hesitant to adopt OLED technology given the risks inherent in depending on a sole source for critical components and the inability to establish alternate supply relationships. If we are unable to supply the components needed by our existing customers in a timely manner, or if potential customers do not utilize OLED technology because of concerns about our ability to meet supply demands, our business may materially suffer. We may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business. Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We may require additional funding in the future for the research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs. When we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain more money when needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or depositary shares, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these shares will dilute our then-existing shareholders. Because the vast majority of OLED product manufacturers are located in the Asia-Pacific region, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations. Many of our customers and prospective customers have a majority of their operations in countries other than the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and revenue outside the United States represents a majority of our total net revenue. We also have offices in various countries located outside of the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include, without limitation: • compliance with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including foreign anti-corruption laws and certain registration requirements for the OLED materials we sell; • legal uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers; • economic instability in the countries of our customers, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our royalties; • political instability in the countries in which we and/or our customers operate, particularly in South Korea relating to its disputes with and proximity to North Korea, in Hong Kong relating to anti-government protests and in Taiwan relating to its disputes with China; • third party theft or compromise of our products, technology, data or intellectual property, including by means of counterfeiting or reverse-engineering; • difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; • potentially adverse tax and tariff consequences; and • trade conflicts between and among various geopolitical factions. 23 Any of these factors could impair our ability to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials, thereby harming our business. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. We rely on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. We are dependent on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit important data and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third-party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third-party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third-party vendors, that could adversely affect our business. We may be subject to environmental laws and regulations that impose additional compliance costs and that could negatively impact our business. Changes in environmental laws or regulations of our products could result in higher operating and compliance expenses and limit the markets in which we can manufacture and to which we can export our products. Changes in environmental laws or regulations, including laws relating to manufacturing operations and export restrictions, also could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and an increase in raw materials costs, and could increase our environmental compliance expenditures. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose additional operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial condition. The U.S. government has rights to intellectual property derived from our government-funded work that might prevent us from realizing the full benefits of our intellectual property portfolio. The U.S. government, through various government agencies, has provided and continues to provide funding to us, Princeton, USC and Michigan for work related to certain aspects of our OLED technologies. Because we have been provided with this funding, the government has rights to any intellectual property derived from this work that could restrict our ability to market OLED products to the government for military and other applications, or to license this intellectual property to third parties for commercial applications. Moreover, if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of this intellectual property in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government could require us to license this intellectual property to other parties in that field of use. Any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain maximum value from our intellectual property portfolio. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies, particularly other emerging-growth companies in the technology industry. We have included in the section of this report entitled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” a table indicating the high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market for the past two years. Factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future: • our revenues, expenses and operating results; • announcements by us, by our customers, or our competitors of technological developments, new product applications or contractual arrangements; • announcements relating to dividends and share repurchases; and • other factors affecting the display and solid-state lighting industries in general. 24 Our operating results may have significant period-to-period fluctuations, which would make it difficult to predict our future performance. Due to the current stage of commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, current geopolitical risks, the limited number of commercially successful consumer products utilizing our OLED technologies that customers have introduced in the marketplace, the relatively short product lifetimes of these consumer products, and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our customers must achieve for the widespread inclusion of our OLED technologies in consumer products such as mobile phones, tablets, television displays and lighting products, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time. Among other factors affecting our period-to-period results, our license and technology development fees often consist of large one-time, annual, semi-annual or quarterly payments, which may result in significant fluctuations in our revenues. In addition, our reliance on a relatively small number of licensees with large volumes of consumer product sales makes our quarterly operating results subject to our licensees’ specific plans and the success of their specific product offerings. With respect to material sales, our sales are primarily dependent on purchases made by a relatively small number of customers. In addition to the other factors described above relating to our customers’ sales opportunities, our quarter-to-quarter sales may be materially impacted by our customers’ inventory management plans, which may vary substantially based on financial management considerations, changes in their product mix plans, modified material processing techniques and manufacturing line modifications. If, in some future period, our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price. Broad market, industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock. The price of our common stock could decrease if: • shares of our common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable, whether through an effective registration statement or based on Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or • we issue additional shares of our common stock that might be or become freely salable, including shares that would be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding stock options. We can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could: • adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of our common stock; • make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us; • discourage bids for our common stock at a premium; or • otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 20, 2020, we have issued and outstanding 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of Sherwin I. Seligsohn, our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past, none of which are currently outstanding, and may do so again at any time in the future. Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In 2017, our Board of Directors began declaring quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, which we have consistently paid since then and we intend to continue to pay in the future. However, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any 25 manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which current shareholders purchased their shares. Our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including takeover attempts. Our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates and the adult children of Sherwin Seligsohn, beneficially own, as of February 20, 2020, approximately 9.3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these individuals may, as a practical matter, be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. This concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. Natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or earthquakes, particularly in Asia-Pacific region, where many of our customers are located, or the occurrence of other unforeseen catastrophic events, such a fire or flood, could unfavorably affect our business and financial performance. Such events could unfavorably affect our customers in many ways, such as causing physical damage to one or more of their properties, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more plants, the disruption or cessation of manufacturing of product lines, and the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or demand for their products. A resulting by-product of such natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could be a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of or demand for our products. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. In December 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code, was signed into law. While we believe that this law generally will have a favorable effect on U.S. corporations and their shareholders, uncertainty remains regarding the full effect that this law will have on us, particularly given the global nature of our operations, or the impact on our customers, vendors, shareholders and other stakeholders. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and business operations, and adversely impact our shareholders. Occasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices and research and development laboratories are located at 375 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey. In 2004, we acquired the building and property at which this facility is located. During 2005, we conducted a two-stage expansion of our laboratory and office space in the building, as well as a recent expansion in 2013 and 2015. We currently occupy the entire newly expanded facility. In 2017, we acquired the building and property at which the Adesis facility is located at 27 McCullough Drive in New Castle, Delaware. In 2019, we purchased 250 and 300 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to our headquarters. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. 26 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and as our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend against claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and we have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Division has scheduled an appeal hearing for the third quarter of 2020. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid, and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. 27 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our Common Stock Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “OLED.” As of February 20, 2020, there were approximately 314 holders of record of our common stock. During 2017, 2018 and 2019, we declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock. While we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends in the future, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. 28 Performance Graph The performance graph below compares the change in the cumulative shareholder return of our common stock from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2019, with the percentage change in the cumulative total return over the same period on (i) the Russell 2000 Index, and (ii) the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index.

(2) During the second quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a faster-than-anticipated decline in host material sales, which we believe was a result of our customer's selling new products that did not include our host materials. Based on the most recent sales forecast, we determined that there were likely to be significantly lower sales of our existing host material. As such, a write-down in net realizable value of our inventory of $33.0 million during the second quarter of 2015 was required. 30 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” in this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Item 1A of this report, entitled “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED), technologies and materials for use in display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been engaged and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • technology development and support, including third-party collaboration efforts and providing support to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products; and • contract research services in the areas of chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, we entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, we are being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of our intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time that we entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, we also entered into a material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from us a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and our ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, we entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), which were effective as of January 1, 2015. The agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under our patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. We generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sales of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. 31 In 2016, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, we have granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Tianma’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we suppl y phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, we entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, we have granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. We also supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, we entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, we have granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by us to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on Visionox’s sales of licensed products. Additionally, we supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, we entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). We have been collaborating with CSOT in the area of OLED display product design and manufacture and expect to continue to do so. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2019, Adesis employed a team of 94 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition of Adesis in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries by providing contract research services for non-OLED applications to those third-party customers. Contract research services revenue is earned by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to our government contracts, we may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories and income taxes, as described below, are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. 32 Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the sale of our OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example, a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return. The rights and benefits to our OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. We estimate total material units to be purchased by our customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and our forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, our management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of our customers over the contract term. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of our assessment we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, based on previous earnings history, a current evaluation of expected future taxable income and other evidence, we determined to retain the valuation allowance that relates to New Jersey research and development credits. Actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is generated in future periods. To the extent we establish a new valuation allowance or change a previously established valuation allowance in a future period, income tax expense will be impacted. 33 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS For a discussion of our results of operations comparison for 2018 and 2017, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 filed on February 21, 2019. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (Decrease) Increase REVENUE $ 405,177 $ 247,414 $ 157,763 COST OF SALES 75,374 53,541 21,833 Gross margin 329,803 193,873 135,930 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 71,276 53,717 17,559 Selling, general and administrative 59,613 46,999 12,614 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 21,962 21,962 — Patent costs 6,833 7,464 (631 ) Royalty and license expense 11,776 6,996 4,780 Total operating expenses 171,460 137,138 34,322 OPERATING INCOME 158,343 56,735 101,608 Interest income, net 10,795 7,659 3,136 Other income (expense), net 767 (83 ) 850 Interest and other income, net 11,562 7,576 3,986 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 169,905 64,311 105,594 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (31,601 ) (5,471 ) (26,130 ) NET INCOME $ 138,304 $ 58,840 $ 79,464 Revenue During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized revenue of $405.2 million, an increase of $157.8 million from $247.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in revenue was due to higher material sales as a result of stronger demand in the OLED display market. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 95% for the year ended December 31, 2018. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Revenue from contract research services consists of revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which provides support services to the pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries on a contractual basis for those third-party customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $21.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, was an increase in inventory reserve of $5.9 million and $3.6 million, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. As a result of the increase in material sales, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2019, increased by $135.9 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, with gross margin as a percentage of revenue increasing to 81% from 78%. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses and operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $59.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 34 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $22.0 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. See Note 7 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Patent costs Patent costs decreased to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower outside counsel fees partially offset by higher talent related maintenance costs and higher internal patent prosecution related costs. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC, and Michigan, resulting from an increase in qualifying material sales. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest and other income, net Interest income, net was $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2019 over amounts held during 2018. Other income (expense), net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and rental income. We recorded other income, net of $767,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to other expense, net of $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was an expense of 18.6% and 8.5% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $31.6 million and $5.5 million, respectively, for those periods. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-09. For the year ended December 31, 2019, without the $3.0 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 20.4% and $34.6 million, respectively, and for the year ended December 31, 2018, without the $1.1 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 10.2% and $6.6 million, respectively. The Company incurred Korean withholding tax of $14.9 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, which is currently being appealed based on the interpretation of the Korean – U. S. tax treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our short-term investments. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $131.6 million and short-term investments of $514.5 million, for a total of $646.1 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $211.0 million and short-term investments of $304.3 million, for a total of $515.3 million, as of December 31, 2018. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $193.9 million resulting from $138.3 million of net income and $139.5 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $83.9 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $157.3 million, an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $15.5 million, an increase in other liabilities of $12.4 million and a decrease in inventory of $109,000, partially offset by an increase in other assets of $28.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $17.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $121.8 million resulting from $58.8 million of net income and $95.3 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by a $32.3 million reduction due to non-cash items including amortization of deferred revenue, amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities related to an increase in deferred revenue of $130.6 million, an increase in other liabilities of $29.7 million, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $20.7 million, a decrease in accounts receivable of $9.2 million and an increase in 35 accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1.6 million , partially offset by a n increase in other assets of $ 59.1 million an d an increase in inventory of $ 37.4 million. Cash used in investing activities was $238.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net purchases of $208.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to net sales of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and an increase in purchases of intangibles and property, plant and equipment of $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in property, plant and equipment purchases during 2019 was primarily due to the purchase of additional property in Ewing, New Jersey as part of our plan to expand operations. Cash used in financing activities was $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $7.5 million, an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $4.4 million and an increase in the repurchase of common stock of $172,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $91,000. Working capital was $630.9 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $501.7 million as of December 31, 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in short-term investments, accounts receivable and other current assets, partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in deferred revenue and accrued expenses. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2019, we had the following contractual commitments (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Estimated retirement plan benefit payments $ 71,501 $ — $ 8,065 $ 9,236 $ 54,200 Lease obligations 10,347 1,958 2,487 2,077 3,825 Purchasing obligations 22,035 22,035 — — — Research related obligations 5,628 5,253 375 — — Minimum royalty obligation (1) 500 100 200 200 $100/year Total (2) $ 110,011 $ 29,346 $ 11,127 $ 11,513 $ 58,025 (1) Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Princeton minimum royalties of $100,000 per year until the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement has no scheduled expiration date. (2) See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in our control. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 36 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those statements are attached to this report beginning on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The report of management on our internal control over financial reporting and the associated attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm are set forth in Item 8 of this report. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION None. 37 PART III ITEM 10.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based upon criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been attested to by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the following page. Steven V. Abramson President and Chief Executive Officer Sidney D. Rosenblatt Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 20, 2020 F-2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 20, 2020 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and Board of Directors Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases . In addition, as discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers as of January 1, 2018 due to the adoption of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Assessment of the estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts As discussed in Notes 2 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for organic light emitting diode (OLED) sales to customers with long-term contracts (i.e., over 1 year in length) using certain estimates. Revenue is determined by estimating total contract consideration expected to be received over the term of the contract and recognized based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. The estimated per unit fee includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees, as well as estimates of material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. The Company uses internal and external data to estimate material units to be sold and royalty consideration to be received over the contract terms. F-4 We identified the assessment of the estimated per unit fee for long-term OLED contracts as a critical audit matter. The estimated per unit fee was dependent upon the estimates of total material units to be sold and royalties to be earned. Significant auditor judgment was required in evaluating the forecasted material unit sales and royalties, as changes in the estimates could significantly affect the estimated per unit fee. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s revenue recognition process, including the Company’s review and approval of forecasted quantities of material unit sales of OLED products and review of forecasted royalties. We assessed the Company’s forecasting policies and procedures by obtaining an understanding of the forecasting process and the inputs used in making the estimates and evaluating the reliability of those inputs. We inspected the forecast calculations for a selection of OLED contracts and compared the per-material unit prices and royalty rates used against the respective contract terms. We compared the OLED material unit sales forecast to internal operating and production budgets and we compared the OLED material unit sales and royalty forecasts to the results of inquiries of Company personnel, publicly available market data, and analyst reports.

F-10 UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, wearable, tablet, notebook and personal computer, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and automotive markets. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high-power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership, intellectual property position, and the Company’s more than 20 years of experience working closely with leading OLED display manufacturers are some of the competitive advantages that should enable the Company to continue to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they gain wider acceptance. The Company’s primary business strategy is to (1) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to product manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, wearables, tablets, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) further develop and license the Company’s proprietary OLED technologies to those manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining long-standing, and establishing new relationships with world-class universities, research institutions and strategic manufacturing partnerships. The Company currently owns, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company manufactures and sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under the Company’s patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies that are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Principles of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd., Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) and UDC Ventures LLC. UDC Ventures LLC was formed on March 1, 2019 as a corporate venture capital entity that will assist in funding companies that are developing innovative products and technologies that may be synergistic to those of the Company. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, lease liabilities, right-of-use assets, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles, investments and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. F-11 Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company’s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties and license fees. These receivables have historically been paid timely. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant risk of collection. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts would be required. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 84,000 , $ 77,000 and none at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 30 years for building, 15 years for building improvements, and three to seven years for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets and any gain or loss is reflected in other operating expenses. Certain costs of computer software obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three years . Costs for maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to an existing system, are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Company management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31, 2019, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company’s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. Company management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If it is concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment assessment is not necessary. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, then its carrying value is written down to fair value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need to be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. If necessary, the second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of December 31, 2019 utilizing a F-12 qualitative evaluation and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Adesis is great er than its carrying value. Company management believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fa ir value of the reporting unit. Future impairment tests will continue to be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs. As o f December 31, 201 9 , no indications of impairment exist ed . Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances Minority Equity Investments The Company accounts for minority equity investments in companies that are not accounted for under the equity method as equity securities without readily determinable fair values. The fair values of these securities is based on original cost less impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Under this method, the share of income or loss of such companies is not included in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The carrying value of these investments is included in investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment in the value of its minority equity investments when clear evidence of an impairment exists. Factors considered in the assessment include a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment, the completion of new equity financing that may indicate a decrease in value, the failure to complete new equity financing arrangements after seeking to raise additional funds, or the commencement of proceedings under which the assets of the business may be placed in receivership or liquidated to satisfy claims of debt and equity stakeholders. Leases The Company is a lessee in operating leases primarily incurred to facilitate the expansion of manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. As discussed in Note 8, effective January 1, 2019, the Company accounts for leases in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, Leases . At contract inception, the Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease, and if so recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement date. For operating leases, the lease liability is measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments at the lease commencement date, whereas for finance leases, the lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the unpaid lease payments and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the interest method. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no leases that qualified as financing arrangements. Key estimates and judgements include how the Company determines the discount rate used to discount the unpaid lease payments to present value and the lease term. The Company monitors for events or changes in circumstances that could potentially require recognizing an impairment loss. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Revenue associated with material sales is generally recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement F-13 between the parties. Revenue may be recognized after control of the material passes in the event the transaction price includes variable consideration. For example , a customer may be provided an extended opportunity to stock materials prior to use in mass production and given a general right of return not conditioned on breaches of warranties associated with the specific product. In such circumstances, revenue will be recognized at the earlier of the expiration of the customer’s general right of return or once it becomes unlikely that the customer will exercise its right of return . The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technologies are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Management uses the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis by providing chemical materials synthesis research, development and commercialization for non-OLED applications on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, along with, to a minimal extent, government contracts. Relating to the Company’s government contracts, the Company may receive reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years . The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company generates revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement F-14 calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company suppl ies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE for use in its licensed products. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2019, the Company entered into an evaluation and commercial supply relationship with Wuhan China Star Optoelectronics Semiconductor Display Technology Co., Ltd. (CSOT). The Company has been collaborating with CSOT in the area of OLED display product design and manufacture and expects to continue to do so. All material sales transactions that are not variable consideration transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs primarily relate to technology acquired from BASF and Fujifilm. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2012, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for both the BASF and Fujifilm patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Note 7 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. F-15 Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50 %. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the Consolidated Statements of Income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards with market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , which addresses the classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities formerly classified as operating leases under generally accepted accounting principles. The guidance addresses the certain aspects of recognition and measurement, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted the standard beginning on January 1, 2019 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements and have applied all practical expedients related to leases existing at the date of initial application including the exception for short-term leases. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities of $ 8.3 million based on the present value of the future minimum rental payments for existing operating leases. The Company has no leases that qualify as financing arrangements. See Note 8 for additional information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment , eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2017-04, beginning on January 1, 2020, will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments: Credit Losses (Topic 326) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected losses for financial assets held. The new standard changes the impairment model for most financial instruments, including trade receivables, from an incurred loss method to a new-forward looking approach, based on expected losses. The estimate of expected credit losses will require organizations to incorporate considerations of historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-13, beginning on January 1, 2020, will not have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. F-16 3 . CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company’s portfolio of fixed income securities consists of term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. Government and corporate bonds. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity (maturity at the purchase date) of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining debt security investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Cash and Cash Equivalents The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of cash and cash equivalents (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Cash and Cash Equivalents Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2019 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 119,272 $ — $ — $ 119,272 Money market accounts 12,355 — — 12,355 U.S. Government bonds — — — — $ 131,627 $ — $ — $ 131,627 December 31, 2018 Cash accounts in banking institutions $ 71,217 $ — $ — $ 71,217 Money market accounts 11,014 — — 11,014 U.S. Government bonds 128,782 9 — 128,791 $ 211,013 $ 9 $ — $ 211,022 Short-term Investments The following table provides details regarding the Company’s portfolio of short-term investments (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Short-term Investments Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2019 Certificates of deposit $ 700 $ — $ — $ 700 U.S. Government bonds 513,577 190 ( 6 ) 513,761 $ 514,277 $ 190 $ ( 6 ) $ 514,461 December 31, 2018 Certificates of deposit $ 500 $ — $ ( 1 ) $ 499 Corporate Bonds 114,678 1 ( 19 ) 114,660 U.S. Government bonds 189,202 5 ( 43 ) 189,164 $ 304,380 $ 6 $ ( 63 ) $ 304,323 Minority Investments The Company’s portfolio of minority investments consists of investments in privately held early stage companies primarily motivated to gain early access to new technology and are passive in nature in that the Company does not obtain representation on the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had one minority investment with a carrying value of $ 5.0 million accounted for as an equity security without a readily determinable fair value. 4 . FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2019 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 12,355 $ 12,355 $ — $ — Short-term investments 514,461 514,461 — — F-17 The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total Carrying Value as of December 31, 2018 Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 139,805 $ 139,805 $ — $ — Short-term investments 304,323 304,323 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the debt investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive loss. If a decline in fair value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary, the cost of the Company’s investment will be written down by the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment with a resulting charge to net income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments as of December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018. 5 . INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2019 2018 Raw materials $ 25,920 $ 31,203 Work-in-process 7,987 781 Finished goods 30,046 38,016 Inventory $ 63,953 $ 70,000 The Company recorded an increase in inventory reserve of $ 5.9 million and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to excess inventory levels in certain products. No increase in inventory reserve was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. 6 . PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2019 2018 Land $ 2,642 $ 1,006 Building and improvements 47,994 39,285 Office and lab equipment 74,726 55,333 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 7,592 6,941 Construction-in-progress 12,194 12,117 145,148 114,682 Less: Accumulated depreciation ( 57,276 ) ( 44,943 ) Property and equipment, net $ 87,872 $ 69,739 Depreciation expense was $ 12.5 million, $ 8.6 million and $ 4.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased property in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to its headquarters, as part of its plan to expand operations. The new facilities added approximately 88,000 square feet at a cost of $ 8.2 million and will allow for the expansion of research and development activities, manufacturing logistics and other corporate functions. F-18 7 . GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and internally developed IP processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2019 2018 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 Other 401 — 223,242 222,841 Less: Accumulated amortization ( 132,468 ) ( 111,890 ) Acquired technology, net $ 90,774 $ 110,951 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $ 20.6 million for all years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 20.6 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2020 through 2021, $ 15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022, $ 9.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2023, $ 9.6 million in the year ending December 31, 2024 and $ 14.5 million thereafter. Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $ 105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $105.0 million plus $ 4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of € 86.8 million ($ 95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $ 217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. F-19 Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $ 16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $ 10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $ 4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $ 1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At December 31, 2019, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2019 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ ( 3,142 ) $ 7,378 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 ( 1,108 ) 3,712 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 ( 518 ) 982 Total identifiable other intangible assets $ 16,840 $ ( 4,768 ) $ 12,072 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $ 1.4 million for all years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the Consolidated Statements of Income and is expected to be $ 1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2020 - 2024) and $ 5.1 million thereafter. Goodwill As a result of the Adesis acquisition, the Company recorded $ 15.5 million of goodwill. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year unless events suggest an impairment may have been incurred in an interim period. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires the exercise of judgment, including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. As part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2019, there were no significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Adesis had occurred. 8. LEASES: The Company has entered into operating leases to facilitate the expansion of its manufacturing, research and development, and selling, general and administrative activities. For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when those events are reasonably certain to occur. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and as such the Company uses the appropriate incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate on January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. Current lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any finance leases and no additional operating leases that have not yet commenced. As stated in Note 2, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Topic 842 using the modified retrospective transition method. As such, the Company did not restate financial statement or lease disclosure data for periods prior to January 1, 2019, which was prepared in accordance with ASC Topic 840, Leases . The following table presents the Company’s operating lease cost and supplemental cash flow information related to the Company’s operating leases (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 Operating lease cost $ 1,855 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 9,776 As of December 31, 2019, current operating leases had remaining terms between one and nine years with options to extend the lease terms and the Company had operating lease right-of-use assets of $ 8.5 million, current operating lease liabilities of $ 1.6 million and long-term operating lease liabilities of $ 6.9 million. F-20 Operating lease cost was $ 1.7 million and $ 972,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table presents weighted average assumptions used to compute the Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities: December 31, 2019 Weighted average remaining lease term (in years) 7.4 Weighted average discount rate 5.5 % Undiscounted future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2019, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were as follows (in thousands): Maturities of Operating Lease Liabilities 2020 $ 1,958 2021 1,278 2022 1,209 2023 1,070 2024 1,007 Thereafter 3,825 Total lease payments 10,347 Less imputed interest ( 1,865 ) Present value of lease payments $ 8,482 Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2018, by year and in the aggregate, having non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year were expected to be as follows: Total Minimum Lease Payments 2019 $ 1,652 2020 1,512 2021 833 2022 833 2023 833 Thereafter 4,721 Total lease payments $ 10,384 9. ACCRUED EXPENSES: Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2019 2018 Compensation $ 30,295 $ 13,803 Royalties 11,776 6,996 Research and development agreements 3,052 3,572 Consulting 471 527 Professional Fees 268 655 Other 3,160 10,504 Accrued Expenses $ 49,022 $ 36,057 10. RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research F-21 Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years . On May 1, 2009, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work being performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. The Company incurred a total of $ 5.0 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement, which ended on April 30, 2013. Effective June 1, 2013, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years . The Company incurred a total of $ 4.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term. Effective May 1, 2017, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years . As of December 31, 2019, in connection with this amendment, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $ 1.8 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. From May 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, the Company incurred $ 2.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3 % of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3 % of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $ 100,000 per year. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 11.8 million, $ 7.0 million and $ 9.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $ 800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. 11 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and is automatically renewed for additional one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2020. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. F-22 Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50 % of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $ 20.00 , the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $ 1.4 million, $ 771,000 and $ 1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 12. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $ 7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock The Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up 200,000,000 shares of $ 0.01 par value common stock. Each share of the Company’s common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters to be voted upon by the shareholders. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had issued 48,852,193 shares of common stock, of which 47,486,545 were outstanding. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 4,011 and 3,774 shares, respectively, of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for aggregate purchase prices of $ 649,000 and $ 477,000 , respectively.

The fair value of the shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $ 300,000 for both years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $ 0.40 per common share, or $ 18.9 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On February 18, 2020 , the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $ 0.15 per common share to be paid on March 31, 2020 to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 17, 2020 . All future dividends will be subject to the approval of the Company’s Board of Directors. F-23 13.

(2) Refer to Note 15: Employee Retirement Plans 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through December 31, 2019, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000 , and have extended the term of the plan through 2024 . As of December 31, 2019, there were 2,248,573 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Stock Options The following table summarizes the stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2019 for all the grants under the Equity Compensation Plan (in thousands, except share and per share data): F-24 Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 1, 2019 500 $ 10.04 Forfeited/Expired ( 500 ) 10.04 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 — $ — No stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2017 was $ 146,000 . No stock options were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. There was no compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no shares of common stock were tendered to net share settle the exercise of options. Restricted Stock Award and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock unit (RSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2019 92,381 $ 97.56 Granted 58,549 168.95 Vested ( 49,635 ) 87.96 Forfeited ( 2,485 ) 103.79 Unvested, December 31, 2019 98,810 $ 144.53 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSU awards granted was $ 168.95 , $ 115.48 and $ 116.58 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 7.7 million, $ 8.1 million and $ 8.3 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock award (RSA) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2019 409,949 $ 46.74 Granted 73,640 194.19 Vested ( 171,946 ) 47.89 Unvested, December 31, 2019 311,643 $ 80.94 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSA awards granted was $ 194.19 , $ 122.15 and $ 83.25 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSAs was $ 28.4 million, $ 17.7 million and $ 14.8 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to restricted stock awards and units issued to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 10.0 million, $ 7.6 million and $ 8.5 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 1.1 million, $ 758,000 and $ 443,000 , respectively, and research and development expense of $ 2.5 million, $ 2.0 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively. F-25 In connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and units during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 86,075 , 86,679 and 89,661 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 14.0 million, $ 9.2 million and $ 7.8 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board, whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $ 632,000 , $ 64,000 and $ 976,000 , respectively. The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with quarterly vesting over a period of approximately one year . The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed, related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 916,000 , $ 4.3 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively. In connection with the vesting of the restricted stock, the Company issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors 9,332 , 25,000 and 27,500 shares during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the total unrecognized expense related to all restricted stock awards and units was $ 30.0 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 2.25 years. Performance Unit Awards Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. The following table summarizes the activity related to performance unit awards (PSU) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2019 52,730 $ 86.43 Granted 25,746 198.72 Vested ( 40,695 ) 59.09 Unvested, December 31, 2019 37,781 $ 134.97 During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted 10,096 , 40,601 and 24,664 performance units, respectively, of which 5,050 , 6,022 and 7,817 units, respectively, are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 5,046 , 6,025 and 7,821 units, respectively, are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and will vest over the terms described below. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, there were also 15,650 , 28,554 and 9,026 incremental performance-based shares, respectively, that vested resulting from an increased vesting factor based on Company performance. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $ 198.72 , $ 119.62 and $ 105.65 during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all performance stock units, selling, general and administrative expense of $ 1.7 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively, cost of sales of $ 208,000 , $ 141,000 and $ 119,000 , respectively, and research and development expense of $ 419,000 , $ 330,000 and $ 276,000 , respectively. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 16,668 , 25,208 and 19,217 shares, respectively, with aggregate fair values of $ 2.6 million, $ 2.9 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively, were withheld in satisfaction of tax withholding obligations and are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. F-26 As of December 31, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to performance unit awards was $ 2.7 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.87 years. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month purchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee opts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85 % of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10 % of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $ 25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company issued 7,492 , 10,303 and 9,730 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $ 889,000 , $ 798,000 and $ 734,000 , respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded charges of $ 79,000 , $ 82,000 and $ 69,000 , respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $ 73,000 , $ 81,000 , $ 46,000 , respectively, to cost of sales and $ 118,000 , $ 130,000 and $ 94,000 , respectively, to research and development expense, related to the ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 15. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS: Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains the Universal Display Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan covers substantially all full-time employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to 90 % of their total compensation to the Plan, not to exceed the limit as defined in the Code. Once an employee is eligible to participate in the Plan, the Company will make a non-elective contribution equal to 3 % of the employee’s total compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company contributed $ 880,000 , $ 1.2 million and $ 601,000 , respectively, to the Plan. Defined Benefit Plan On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment. As of December 31, 2019 there were seven participants in the SERP. The SERP benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and in certain cases, the participant's average annual bonus for the most recent three fiscal years ending prior to the participant's date of termination of employment with the Company for the life of the participant. For this purpose, annual base salary means 12 times the average monthly base salary paid or payable to the participant during the 24 -month period immediately preceding the participant’s date of termination of employment, or, if required, the date of a change in control of the Company. Under the SERP, if a participant resigns or is terminated without cause at or after age 65 and with at least 20 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. The benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and bonus for the life of the participant. This percentage is 50 %, 25 % or 15 %, depending on the participant’s benefit class. If a participant resigns at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit. If a participant is terminated without cause or on account of a disability after at least 15 years of service, he or she will F-27 be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit in either case would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20 . In the event a participant is terminated for cause, his or her SERP benefit and any future benefit payments are subject to immediate forfeiture . The SERP benefit is payable in installments over 10 years, beginning at the later of age 65 or the date of the participant’s separation from service. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancy of the participant. This calculation is made as of the date benefit payments are to begin (later of age 65 or separation from service). If the participant dies after reaching age 65, any future or remaining benefit payments are made to the participant’s beneficiary or estate. If the participant dies before reaching age 65, the benefit is forfeited. In the event of a change in control of the Company, each participant will become immediately vested in his or her SERP benefit. Unless the participant’s benefit has already fully vested, if the participant has less than 20 years of service at the time of the change in control, he or she will receive a prorated benefit based on his or her number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. If the change in control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then each participant (including former employees who are entitled to SERP benefits) will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the benefit immediately upon the change in control. Certain of the Company’s executive officers are designated as special participants under the SERP. If these participants resign or are terminated without cause after 20 years of service, or at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, they will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. If they are terminated without cause or on account of a disability, they will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. The SERP benefit for special participants is based on 50 % of their annual base salary and bonus for their life and the life of their surviving spouse, if any. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancies of the participant and their surviving spouse, if any. If they die before reaching age 65, the benefit is not forfeited if the surviving spouse, if any, lives until the participant would have reached age 65. If their spouse also dies before the participant would have reached age 65, the benefit is forfeited. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates, and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. In connection with the initiation and subsequent amendments of the SERP, the Company recorded cost related to prior service of $ 21.7 million as accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2019. The prior service cost is being amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average of the remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ending December 31, 2020 is $ 3.4 million. Information relating to the Company’s plan is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 44,055 $ 33,176 Service cost 969 1,301 Interest cost 1,613 1,047 Actuarial loss 4,480 8,531 Benefit obligation, end of year 51,117 44,055 Fair value of plan assets — — Unfunded status of the plan, end of year $ 51,117 $ 44,055 Current liability — — Noncurrent liability $ 51,117 $ 44,055 The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan was $ 48.1 million and $ 41.3 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. F-28 The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Service cost $ 969 $ 1,301 $ 1,214 Interest cost 1,613 1,047 1,013 Amortization of prior service cost 1,595 1,683 1,667 Amortization of loss 1,641 435 457 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 5,818 $ 4,466 $ 4,351 The measurement date is the Company’s fiscal year end. The net periodic pension cost is based on assumptions determined at the prior year end measurement date. Assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Discount rate 2.64 % 3.82 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Discount rate 3.82 % 3.22 % 3.41 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over future years based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants, when the accumulation of such gains or losses exceeds 10 % of the year end benefit obligation. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost or credit) is included in the Company’s results of income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the net periodic pension cost in 2020 are as follows (in thousands): Amortization of prior service cost $ 1,099 Amortization of loss 2,260 Total $ 3,359 Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future service, are currently expected to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year Projected Benefits 2020 $ — 2021 3,777 2022 4,288 2023 4,618 2024 4,618 2025-2029 28,400 Thereafter 25,800 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 10 for further explanation. F-29 Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 10 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and two employees which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer or employee in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into a New OLED Materials Agreement (see Note 11) that allows PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement allows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 22.0 million, $ 15.9 million and $ 14.2 million, respectively. Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below is a summary of an active proceeding that has been commenced against an issued patent that is exclusively licensed to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceeding would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, including its Consolidated Statements of Income, as a whole. However, as noted within the description, the following proceeding involves an issued patent that relates to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize a proceeding to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The European Patent Office (EPO) combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under European Patent Convention Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The EPO Opposition Division has scheduled and appeal hearing for the third quarter of 2020. The patent, as originally granted, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. F-30 In addition to the above proceeding and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely used in the marketplace. 17.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that relates to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018, the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this decision, the Company has decided to litigate the Korean withholding taxes paid or withheld on the 2018 and 2019 royalty payments and has engaged a leading Korean law firm which has advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has recorded a long-term asset of $ 26.9 million and $ 13.6 million, respectively, representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a long-term liability of $ 25.7 million and $ 7.7 million, respectively, for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on the amendment of U.S. tax returns for lower withholding amounts. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, the Company has decided to continue the U.S.-Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term asset of $ 36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $ 16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and R&D credits of $ 20.7 million has been recorded on the December 31, 2019 and 2018 Consolidated Balance Sheets for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the KNTS concluded a tax audit with LG Display that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDC Ireland during the years 2015 through 2017. The KNTS questioned whether UDC Ireland was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDC Ireland a charge of $ 13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDC Ireland has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDC Ireland has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDC Ireland has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $ 14.9 million, $ 14.9 million and $ 17.6 million, respectively; which is currently being appealed based on the interpretation of the Korea-U.S. Tax Treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. F-33 The Company’s 2013 federal income tax return was audited by the Internal Revenue Services with no change; the years 201 6 to 201 9 are open and subject to examination. The State of New Jersey is currently auditing the 2014 to 2017 tax returns of UDC Inc. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years . The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. 19. REVENUE RECOGNITION: Effective on January 1, 2018, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . The standard establishes the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with one of its customers for emitters involving elements of variable consideration. Due to the escalation in trade policy tension between the governments of China and the United States, the customer required a larger than normal shipment of emitters having a right to return them through March 15, 2020 in order to accommodate their uncertain production needs. Per Topic 606, the Company was constrained to recognizing revenue on this unique shipment to the extent that it was probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur and deferred recognition of the remainder until after the inherent uncertainties of the transaction were resolved. These uncertainties include factors that are outside of the Company’s influence, including the customer’s production needs and complexities associated with the current international health and trade issues in China. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded 97 %, 95 % and 97 %, respectively, of its revenue from sales of material and 3 %, 5 % and 3 %, respectively, from the providing of services through Adesis. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of December 31, 2019 Accounts receivable $ 60,452 Short-term unbilled receivables 1,362 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 97,333 Long-term deferred revenue 47,529 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2019 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022 . As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $ 6.5 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. F-34 Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 133,394 Increases due to cash received — ( 157,321 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 1,632 Unbilled receivables recognized 1,834 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 1,492 ) — Net change 342 ( 22,295 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 1,362 $ ( 144,862 ) Year Ended December 31, 2018 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 70 $ ( 38,883 ) Adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018 307 ( 21,307 ) Adjusted balance on January 1, 2018 377 ( 60,190 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 64,562 Increases due to cash received — ( 130,639 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 3,700 Unbilled receivables recognized 2,024 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables ( 1,381 ) — Net change 643 ( 62,377 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ ( 122,567 ) Adoption of Topic 606 The Company adopted Topic 606 beginning January 1, 2018 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Under this transition method, the Company elected to apply Topic 606 only to contracts that were not complete at the initial adoption date. Adoption of the new standard resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $ 17.1 million on January 1, 2018. The new standard impacts how the Company recognizes revenue on its commercial license and material supply agreements with customers. Previously, the Company recognized license fees on a straight-line basis or as received from the customer, and royalty revenue one quarter in arrears based on sales information received from its customers typically received after disclosing that quarter’s results. Under the new standard, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at its estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Prior to the adoption of Topic 606 on January 1, 2018, the Company recognized revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) . The impact of Topic 606 on revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, was a decrease of $ 78.9 million, respectively, from the amount that would have been reported under Topic 605. F-35 The following tables summarize the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands) Consolidated Balance Sheet Impact of Changes in Accounting Policies December 31, 2018 As Reported Adjustment Balances Without Adoption of Topic 606 ASSETS Other assets (current and non-current) $ 70,892 $ — $ 70,892 Deferred income taxes 24,377 ( 11,153 ) 13,224 TOTAL ASSETS 933,424 ( 11,153 ) 922,271 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Deferred revenue (current and non-current) 122,567 ( 99,885 ) 22,682 Retained earnings 129,552 88,732 218,284 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 933,424 ( 11,153 ) 922,271 Consolidated Statement of Income Impact of Changes in Accounting Policies Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Adjustment Balances Without Adoption of Topic 606 REVENUE $ 247,414 $ 78,885 $ 326,299 Gross margin 193,873 78,885 272,758 OPERATING INCOME 56,735 78,885 135,620 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 64,311 78,885 143,196 INCOME TAX EXPENSE ( 5,471 ) ( 7,252 ) ( 12,723 ) NET INCOME 58,840 71,633 130,473 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Impact of Changes in Accounting Policies Year Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Adjustment Balances Without Adoption of Topic 606 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES: Net income $ 58,840 $ 71,633 $ 130,473 Amortization of deferred revenue and recognition of unbilled receivables ( 68,905 ) ( 81,991 ) ( 150,896 ) Deferred income tax (benefit) expense ( 12,814 ) 10,358 ( 2,456 ) Other assets (current and non-current) ( 59,062 ) — ( 59,062 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 121,796 — 121,796 20 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share , which requires earnings per share (EPS) for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. F-36 For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the E mployee Stock Purchase Plan . The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2015 Numerator: Net income $ 138,304 $ 58,840 $ 103,885 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders ( 1,106 ) ( 690 ) ( 1,638 ) Adjusted net income $ 137,198 $ 58,150 $ 102,247 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 46,959,775 46,849,588 46,725,289 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 1,334 1,956 2,611 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 34,353 45,222 77,294 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 46,995,462 46,896,766 46,805,194 Net income per common share: Basic $ 2.92 $ 1.24 $ 2.19 Diluted $ 2.92 $ 1.24 $ 2.18 For the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of none , 4,414 and none , respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 2 1 .

BUSINESS Our Company We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market, especially in the mobile phone, television, augmented reality, virtual reality and automotive markets. We believe that this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. We also believe that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. Our technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable us to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they continue to be more broadly adopted. Our primary business strategy is to (1) further develop and license our proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, wearable electronic devices, tablets, notebook computers and televisions, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) develop new OLED materials and sell the materials to those product manufacturers. We have established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through our internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining our relationships with world-class universities and other partners such as Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Michigan (Michigan) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). We currently own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. We sell our proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. We also enter into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which we grant them licenses to practice under our patents and to use our proprietary know-how. At the same time, we work with these and other companies who are evaluating our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. Market Overview The Display Panel Market Thin, energy efficient display panels that can be manufactured on glass or flexible substrates are essential for a wide variety of portable consumer electronics products, such as mobile phones, AR/VR headsets, digital cameras, wearables, tablets and notebook computers. Due to their narrow profile and light weight, flat panel displays have also become the display of choice for larger product applications, such as computer monitors and televisions. Liquid crystal displays, or LCDs, continue to dominate the flat panel display market. However, we believe that OLED displays are an attractive alternative to LCDs because they offer a number of potential advantages, including: • higher power efficiencies, thereby reducing energy consumption; • a thinner profile and lighter weight; • higher contrast ratios, leading to sharper picture images and graphics; • wider viewing angles; • deposition on non-rigid substrates which enable conformable and flexible displays; • faster response times for video; and • lower cost manufacturing methods and materials. Based on these characteristics, product manufacturers have adopted small-area OLED displays for use in a wide variety of electronic devices, such as smartphones, wearables and tablets. Manufacturers are increasingly commercializing large area OLED displays for use in televisions. We believe that if these efforts are successful, they could result in sizeable markets for OLED displays. In addition, due to the inherent transparency of organic materials and through the use of transparent electrode technology, OLEDs eventually may enable the production of transparent displays for use in products such as automotive windshields and windows with embedded displays. Organic materials also make technically possible the development of flexible displays for use in an entirely new set of product applications. Such applications include display devices that can be folded or conformed to various shapes for wearable, industrial and ruggedized applications. 2 The Solid-State Lighting Market Traditional incandescent light bulbs are inefficient because they convert only about 5% of the energy they consume into visible light, with the rest emerging as heat. Fluorescent lamps use excited gases, or plasmas, to achieve a higher energy conversion efficiency of about 20%. However, the color rendering index, or CRI, of most fluorescent lamps – in other words, the quality of their color compared to an ideal light source – is inferior to that of an incandescent bulb. Fluorescent lamps also pose environmental concerns because they typically contain mercury. Solid-state lighting relies on the direct conversion of electricity to visible light using semiconductor materials. By avoiding the heat and plasma-producing processes of incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, respectively, solid-state lighting products can have substantially higher energy conversion efficiencies. There are currently two basic types of solid-state lighting devices: inorganic light emitting diodes, or LEDs, and OLEDs. Current LEDs are very small in size (about one square millimeter) and are extremely bright. Having been developed about 25 years before OLEDs, LEDs are already employed in a variety of lighting products, such as traffic lights, billboards, replacements for incandescent lighting, backlights for smartphones, computer monitors and televisions, and as border or accent lighting. However, the high operating temperatures and intense brightness of LEDs may make them less desirable for many general illumination and diffuse lighting applications. OLEDs, on the other hand, are larger in size and can be viewed directly, without using diffusers that are required to temper the intense brightness of LEDs. OLEDs can be fabricated onto any suitable surface, including glass, plastic or metal foil, and could be cost-effective to manufacture in high volume. Given these characteristics, product manufacturers are working and have introduced limited product applications of OLEDs for diffuse specialty lighting applications and ultimately general illumination. If these efforts are successful, we believe that OLED lighting products could begin to be used for applications currently addressed by incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps, as well as for new applications that take advantage of the OLED form factor. In particular, the ability of OLED technology to produce uniform illumination over arbitrary shapes is making OLED lighting very attractive to the automobile industry. Our Competitive Strengths We believe our position as one of the leading technology developers in the OLED industry is the direct result of our technological innovation. We have built an extensive intellectual property portfolio around our OLED technologies and materials, and are working diligently to enable our manufacturing partners to adopt our OLED technologies and materials for expanding commercial usage. Our key competitive strengths include: Technology Leadership We are a recognized technology leader in the OLED industry. Along with our research partners, we have pioneered the development of our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technologies, which can be used to produce OLEDs that are up to four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs, which are illuminated using backlights. We believe that our phosphorescent OLED technologies and materials are well-suited for industry usage in the commercial production of OLED displays and lighting products. Through our relationships with companies such as PPG and our academic partners, we have also developed other important OLED technologies, as well as novel OLED materials that we believe will facilitate the adoption of our various OLED technologies by product manufacturers. Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the OLED industry. Through our internal development efforts, acquisitions, and our relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton, USC, Michigan and PPG, we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. In 2011, we purchased 74 issued U.S. patents from Motorola Solutions, Inc. (f/k/a Motorola, Inc.) (Motorola), together with foreign counterparts in various countries, which patents we had previously licensed from Motorola, and in 2012, we acquired the entire worldwide patent portfolio of more than 1,200 OLED patents and patent applications of Fujifilm Corporation (Fujifilm). In 2016, we acquired more than 500 issued and then pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies from BASF SE (BASF). We also continue to accumulate valuable non-patented technical know-how relating to our OLED technologies and materials. 3 Lea ding Supplier of UniversalPHOLED® Emitter Materials We are the leading supplier of phosphorescent emitter materials to OLED product manufacturers. The emitter material, which is designed to efficiently convert electrical energy to a desired wavelength of light, is the key component in an OLED device. We develop, supply, and offer for sale proprietary phosphorescent emitter materials. PPG currently manufactures our materials for us, which we then qualify and resell to OLED product manufacturers. We record revenues based on our sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers. Our sales allow us to maintain close technical and business relationships with the OLED product manufacturers purchasing our proprietary materials, which in turn further supports our technology licensing business. Established Material Supply Relationships We have established relationships with well-known manufacturers that are using, or are evaluating for use, our OLED materials in commercial products. In 2018, our customers for such materials included Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC), LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display), AU Optronics Corporation (AU Optronics), BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE), Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. (Konica Minolta), Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma), Tohoku Pioneer Corporation, Innolux Corporation (Innolux) (formerly Chimei Innolux Corporation), Kaneka Corporation (Kaneka), EverDisplay Optronics (Shanghai) Limited and Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox), among others. Licensing Our OLED Technologies and Patents We license our proprietary OLED technologies and patents to product manufacturers on a non-exclusive basis. We do not directly manufacture or sell OLED display or lighting products. Instead, we enter into licensing arrangements with OLED product manufacturers who pay us license fees and/or royalties based on their sales of licensed products. We believe this business model allows us to concentrate on our core strengths of technology development and innovation, while at the same time providing significant operating leverage. We also believe that this approach may reduce potential competitive conflicts with our customers. Licenses with Key Product Manufacturers We have licensed our OLED technologies and patents to manufacturers for use in commercial products. In 2018, we had license agreements for the manufacture and sale of certain display products with SDC (as successor to Samsung Mobile Display Co. Ltd.), LG Display, BOE, Tianma, and Visionox. We also have license agreements with Konica Minolta, Sumitomo Chemical Company, Ltd. (Sumitomo), Pioneer Corporation (Pioneer), Kaneka and OLEDWorks L.L.C. (OLEDWorks) for the manufacture of OLED lighting products. Additionally, we have a license agreement with DuPont Displays for its manufacture of solution-processed OLED display products using proprietary OLED materials obtained through us. Complementary UniversalPHOLED ® Host Material Business We develop, supply and offer for sale certain of our proprietary phosphorescent host materials to OLED product manufacturers. In one design, the emitter material is disbursed into a host material, with the resulting mixture consisting of predominantly host material. We believe that host material sales can be complementary to our phosphorescent emitter material sales business; however, our OLED product manufacturing customers are not required to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials. In addition, the host material business is more competitive than the phosphorescent emitter material sales business. This means our long-term prospects for host material sales are uncertain. Experienced Management and Scientific Advisory Team Our management team has significant experience in developing business models focused on licensing disruptive technologies in high growth industries. In addition, our management team has assembled a Scientific Advisory Board that includes some of the leading researchers in the OLED industry, such as Professor Stephen R. Forrest of Michigan (formerly of Princeton) and Professor Mark E. Thompson of USC. Our Business Strategy Our current business strategy is to promote and continue to expand our portfolio of OLED technologies and materials for widespread use in OLED displays and lighting products. We generate revenues primarily by selling our proprietary OLED materials and licensing our OLED technologies to display and lighting product manufacturers. We are presently focused on the following steps to implement our business strategy: 4 Target Leading Product Manufacturers and Developers We are targeting leading manufacturers of displays and lighting products as potential commercial licensees of our OLED technologies and purchasers of our OLED materials. We also supply our proprietary OLED materials to manufacturers and developers of OLED displays and lighting products for evaluation and for use in product development and for pre-commercial activities, and we provide technical assistance and support to these manufacturers and developers. We concentrate on working closely with OLED product manufacturers and developers because we believe that the successful incorporation of our technologies and materials into commercial products is critical to their widespread adoption. Enhance Our Existing Portfolio of PHOLED Technologies and Materials We believe that a strong portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products is critical to our success. Consequently, we are continually seeking to expand this portfolio through our internal development efforts, our collaborative relationships with academic and other research partners, and other strategic opportunities. One of our primary goals is to develop new and improved phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED) technologies and materials with increased efficiencies, enhanced color gamut and extended lifetimes, which are compatible with different manufacturing methods, so that they can be used by various manufacturers in a broad array of OLED display and lighting products. Develop Next-Generation Organic Technologies We continue to conduct research and development activities relating to next-generation OLED technologies for both displays and lighting products. We also are funding research by our academic partners on the use of organic thin-film technology in other applications. Our focus on next-generation technologies is designed to enable us to maintain our position as a leading provider of OLED and other organic electronics technologies and materials as new markets emerge. Business and Geographic Markets We derive revenue from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • contract research services in the areas of organic and organometallic materials synthesis research, development and commercialization; and • technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products. Most manufacturers of displays and lighting products who are or might potentially be interested in our OLED technologies and materials are currently located outside of the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. To provide on-the-ground support to these manufacturers, we have established wholly-owned subsidiaries in Ireland, Korea, Japan, China and Hong Kong, as well as a representative office in Taiwan. Our subsidiary in Ireland is responsible for all material sales world-wide (excluding the United States) and for licensing and managing intellectual property and undertaking certain other business transactions in all non-U.S. territories. We receive a majority of our revenues from customers that are domiciled outside of the United States, and our business is heavily dependent on our relationships with these customers. In particular, two of our key customers located in the Asia-Pacific region, SDC and LG Display, accounted for 37% and 33%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for 2018. Substantially all revenue derived from our customers is denominated in U.S. dollars. For more information on our revenues, costs and expenses associated with our business, as well as a breakdown of revenues from North America and foreign sources, please see our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto, as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” included elsewhere in this report. Our Technology and its Relation to OLED Technology and Structure OLED devices are solid-state semiconductor devices made from thin films of organic material that emit light of various wavelengths when electricity is selectively applied to the emissive layer of the device. OLED devices are typically referred to as incorporating an “OLED stack.” OLED stacks vary in specific structure but those commonly used today may include a cathode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, an emissive layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer and an anode, all of which are placed on a substrate which may be made of a number of different materials, including glass, plastic and metal. 5 Our technology and materials are most commonly utilized in the emissive layer; the materials in the emissive layer are the light-generating component of the OLED stack. Many of our key technologies relate primarily to phosphorescent emitter materials, which we believe are more energy efficient than fluorescent emitter materials that can also be used to generate light within the emissive layer of the OLED device. We began selli ng emitter materials commercially in 2003. A manufacturer will use a small amount of emitter material for each device through a process called “doping” into a host material. The emitter material(s) and the host material(s) together form an emissive layer s ystem. Depending on the nature of the OLED device, the emissive materials and emissive layer system may be designed to emit different colors. We have commercially produced and sold phosphorescent emitter materials that produce red, yellow, green and light- blue light, which are combined in various ways for the display and lighting markets. Our current materials business, conducted outside the United States by our Irish subsidiary, is focused primarily on the delivery of such emissive materials. We have also developed host materials for the emissive layer and began selling them commercially in 2011. In addition to our materials, which are protected by patents covering various molecular structures, we also have fundamental and important patents that cover various aspects of the OLED device and OLED manufacturing processes. These patents are important to our licensing business because they enable us to provide our business partners important OLED related technologies. Our Phosphorescent OLED Technologies Phosphorescent OLEDs utilize specialized materials and device structures that allow OLEDs to emit light through a process known as phosphorescence. Traditional fluorescent OLEDs emit light through an inherently less efficient process. Theory and experiment show that phosphorescent OLEDs exhibit device efficiencies up to four times higher than those exhibited by fluorescent OLEDs. Phosphorescence substantially reduces the power requirements of an OLED and is useful in displays for hand-held devices, such as smartphones, where battery power is often a limiting factor. Phosphorescence is also important for large-area displays such as televisions, where higher device efficiency and lower heat generation may enable longer product lifetimes and increased energy efficiency. We have a strong intellectual property portfolio surrounding our existing PHOLED technologies and materials for both displays and lighting products which we market under the UniversalPHOLED® brand. We devote a substantial portion of our efforts to developing new and improved proprietary PHOLED materials and device architectures for red, green, yellow, blue and white OLED devices. In 2018, we continued our commercial supply relationships with companies such as SDC, LG Display, Tianma, BOE and Visionox to use such materials to manufacture OLED displays. In addition, we continued to work closely with customers evaluating and qualifying our proprietary PHOLED materials for commercial usage in both displays and lighting products, and with other material suppliers to match our PHOLED emitters with their phosphorescent hosts and other OLED materials. Our Additional Proprietary OLED Technologies Our intellectual property, research, development and commercialization efforts also encompass a number of other OLED device and manufacturing technologies, including the following: FOLED ™ Flexible OLEDs We are working on a number of technologies required for the fabrication of OLEDs on flexible substrates. Most OLED and other flat panel displays are built on rigid glass substrates. In contrast, FOLEDs are OLEDs built on non-rigid substrates such as plastic or metal foil. This has the potential to enhance durability and enable conformation to certain shapes or repeated bending or flexing. Many OLED smartphone displays are built on plastic substrates including those produced by SDC. One of our customers, LG Display, demonstrated a 65-inch rollable FOLED display at the 2019 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) in Las Vegas. The commercial introduction of such FOLED product offerings demonstrates the viability of new display product applications that do not exist commercially today, such as portable, roll-up Internet connectivity and communications devices as well as enhance the usefulness of such devices in ruggedized, industrial and wearable computing systems. Manufacturers also may be able to produce FOLEDs using more efficient continuous, or roll-to-roll, processing methods. Our internal research and development efforts are expected to enhance and promote the future adoption of consumer and industrial FOLED devices. Thin-Film Encapsulation We have developed proprietary, patented encapsulation technology for the packaging of flexible OLEDs and other thin-film devices, as well as for use as a barrier film for plastic substrates. Addressing a major roadblock to the successful commercialization of flexible OLEDs, our hybrid, multi-layer approach provides barrier performance useful for OLEDs using a potentially cost-effective process. In addition to accelerating the commercial viability of flexible OLEDs, our thin-film encapsulation technology has the potential to provide benefits for a variety of other flexible thin-film devices, including photovoltaics and thin-film batteries. 6 UniversalP 2 OLED® Printable Phosphorescent OLEDs The standard approach for manufacturing a small molecule OLED, including a PHOLED, is based on a vacuum thermal evaporation, or VTE, process. With a VTE process, the thin layers of organic material in an OLED are deposited in a high-vacuum environment. An alternate approach for manufacturing a small molecule OLED involves solution processing of the various organic materials in an OLED using techniques such as spin coating or inkjet printing onto the substrate. Solution-processing methods, and inkjet printing in particular, have the potential to be scalable to large area displays. OVJP® Organic Vapor Jet Printing OLEDs could be manufactured using other processes as well, including OVJP. As a direct printing technique, OVJP technology has the potential to offer high deposition rates for large area OLEDs. In addition, OVJP technology reduces OLED material waste associated with use of a shadow mask ( i.e. , the waste of material that deposits on the shadow mask itself when fabricating an OLED). By comparison to inkjet printing, an OVJP process does not use liquid solvents and therefore the OLED materials utilized are not limited by their viscosity or solvent solubility. OVJP also avoids generation of solvent wastes and eliminates the additional step of removing residual solvent from the OLED device. We have installed a prototype OVJP tool at our Ewing, New Jersey facility, and we continue to collaborate on OVJP technology development with Professor Forrest of Michigan. OVPD® Organic Vapor Phase Deposition Another approach for manufacturing a small molecule OLED is based on OVPD. The OVPD process utilizes a carrier gas, such as nitrogen, in a hot walled reactor in a low pressure environment to deposit the layers of organic material in an OLED. The OVPD process may offer advantages over the VTE process or solution processing methods through more efficient materials utilization and enhanced deposition control. We have licensed Aixtron AG, a leading manufacturer of metal-organic chemical vapor deposition equipment, to develop and qualify equipment for the fabrication of OLED displays utilizing the OVPD process. TOLED Transparent OLEDs We have developed a technology for the fabrication of OLEDs that have transparent cathodes. Conventional OLEDs use a reflective metal cathode and a transparent anode. In contrast, TOLEDs use a transparent cathode and either a transparent, reflective or opaque metal anode. TOLEDs utilizing transparent cathodes and reflective metal anodes are known as “top-emission” OLEDs. In a “top-emission” AMOLED, light is emitted without having to travel through much of the device electronics where a significant portion of the usable light is lost. This results in OLED displays having image qualities and lifetimes superior to those of conventional “bottom emitting” AMOLEDs. TOLEDs utilizing transparent cathodes and transparent anodes may also be useful in novel flat panel display applications requiring semi-transparency or transparency, such as graphical displays in automotive windshields and retail window signage. Our Strategic Relationships with Product Manufacturers We have established early-stage evaluation programs, development and pre-commercial programs, and commercial arrangements with a substantial number of manufacturers or potential manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products. Many of these relationships are directed towards tailoring our proprietary OLED technologies and materials for use by individual manufacturers. Our ultimate objective is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to these manufacturers for their commercial production of OLED products. Relationships with OLED Display Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to display manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. We have been collaborating with some of these display manufacturers for many years. We have been working with SDC and providing our PHOLED materials to SDC for evaluation since 2001. Under the terms of a 2011 patent license agreement, we licensed our patents and technologies to SDC for its manufacture and sale of AMOLED display products. Under the terms of a 2011 supplemental purchase agreement, we supplied our proprietary PHOLED materials to SDC for its use in manufacturing licensed products. We also continue to supply SDC with our proprietary UniversalPHOLED materials for use in its development efforts under a 2001 joint development agreement. The 2011 license and purchase agreements with SDC expired on December 31, 2017, and on February 13, 2018, we entered into new patent license and supplemental purchase agreements, both with an effective date of January 1, 2018. These agreements, which cover the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, last through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year 7 extension option. Under th ese agreement s , the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The se agreement s convey to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the est imated life of the assets . The 2018 supplemental purchase agreement provides for certain minimum annual purchase obligations of phosphorescent emitter material from us for use in the manufacture of licensed products. SDC is currently the largest manufactur er of AMOLED displays for handset and other personal electronic devices. We have been working with LG Display or its affiliates for over 15 years. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company expects to generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma. Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company supplies phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE. Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company has also agreed to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox. Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. We have been collaborating with AU Optronics since 2001, and we continue to provide our proprietary PHOLED materials to AU Optronics under a 2016 commercial supply agreement through which AU Optronics also has certain license rights. We also continue to support numerous display manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, through evaluation arrangements in which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for limited scale commercial production, evaluation and for purposes of development, manufacturing qualification and product testing. Many of these strategic relationships have been in place for longer than a decade, and we continue to establish new relationships. Relationships with OLED Lighting Manufacturers We license our OLED technologies and patents to lighting manufacturers for use in commercial products and supply our proprietary OLED materials to these manufacturers for both commercial use and evaluative purposes. Many of these strategic relationships have also been in place for longer than a decade. Since 2004, we have been supporting Konica Minolta in its efforts to develop OLED lighting products. We continue to license our patents and technology to Konica Minolta under a 2008 OLED technology license agreement for its manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products that utilize our phosphorescent and other OLED technologies. We also continue to provide Konica Minolta with our proprietary PHOLED materials for its manufacture of commercial OLED lighting products under a 2011 commercial material supply agreement, and for evaluation purposes under a 2012 evaluation agreement. We also continue to license our OLED patents to Sumitomo under a 2015 OLED patent portfolio license agreement in which we granted Sumitomo a non-exclusive, world-wide, royalty bearing license to make and sell OLED lighting panels using a solution-based manufacturing process. Under the license agreement, Sumitomo may also purchase certain of our phosphorescent materials. We continue to supply LG Display with materials in connection with the OLED lighting business it acquired from LG Chem, Ltd. (LG Chem) in 2015-2016. This lighting business continues to generate commercial chemical sales and license fee revenues under a limited-term commercial sales agreement we signed with LG Chem prior to its acquisition. 8 We continue to license our OLED patents, and to provide our OLED materials, to OLEDWorks for use in OLED lighting products under patent license and commercial supply agreements signed in 2015. We hav e also extended the rights under these agreements to OLEDWorks GmbH, the German company and facility that OLEDWorks acquired in 2015 from Philips Technologie GmbH. We continue to license our technologies and patents to Kaneka for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products, under the terms of a 2013 license agreement, and we continue to supply our materials to Kaneka under a 2014 commercial material supply agreement. We also have a license agreement for the manufacture and sale of OLED lighting products with Pioneer, among others. Similar to our arrangements with display manufacturers, we continue to support numerous lighting manufacturers in their evaluation of our technologies and proprietary OLED materials, typically through evaluation agreements under which we provide our proprietary OLED materials to such manufacturers for evaluation and potential commercial application. Relationships with Manufacturers for Other Commercial Products In addition to our relationships with lighting and display manufacturers, we have agreements and arrangements with manufacturers or potential manufacturers to use our proprietary OLED technologies and materials in other commercial products, such as in automotive interiors and exteriors. Our OLED Materials Manufacturing Business We supply our proprietary UniversalPHOLED® materials to display manufacturers, lighting manufacturers and others. We qualify our materials in OLED devices before shipment in order to ensure that they meet required specifications. We believe that our inventory-carrying practices, along with the terms under which we sell our OLED materials (including payment terms), are typical for the markets in which we operate. In 2018, our OLED materials business received recertification in accordance with ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management Systems. In 2018, UDC’s Ewing, NJ facility also received certification in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management Systems. PPG We have maintained a close working relationship with PPG since 2000. In 2011, we entered into an agreement with PPG, the term of which continues through December 31, 2019 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Under that agreement, PPG is responsible, under our direction, for manufacturing scale-up of our proprietary OLED materials, and for supplying us with those materials. We use these materials for our own research and development as well as for resale to our customers, both for their evaluation and for use in commercial OLED products. Through our collaboration with PPG, key raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers to ensure that we are able to meet the needs of our customers on a timely basis. We have not had any issues with obtaining access to adequate amounts of any key raw materials. We invested a total of $15.6 million from 2016 through 2018 in PPG’s Barberton, Ohio manufacturing facility, to approximately double commercial production capacity for our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent emitter products. The expansion project was completed and operational during 2018. Collaborations with Other OLED Material Manufacturers We continued our non-exclusive collaborative relationships with other manufacturers of OLED materials during 2018. Most of these relationships are focused on matching our proprietary PHOLED emitters with hosts and other OLED materials of these companies. We believe that collaborative relationships such as these are important for ensuring success of the OLED industry and broader adoption of our PHOLED and other OLED technologies. Research and Development Our research and development activities are focused on the advancement of our OLED technologies and materials for displays, lighting and other applications. We conduct this research and development both internally and through various relationships with our commercial business partners and academic institutions. 9 Internal Development Efforts We conduct a substantial portion of our OLED development activities at our state-of-the-art development and testing facility in Ewing, New Jersey. At this expanded facility, which now exceeds 50,000 square feet, we perform technology development, including device and process optimization, prototype fabrication, manufacturing scale-up studies, process and product testing, characterization and reliability studies, and technology transfer with our business partners. Our Ewing facility houses multiple OLED deposition systems, including a full-color flexible OLED system and an OVJP organic vapor jet printing system. In addition, the facility contains equipment for substrate patterning, organic material deposition, display packaging, module assembly and extensive testing in Class 100 and 100,000 clean rooms and opto-electronic test laboratories. Our facility also includes state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical chemistry laboratories in which we conduct OLED materials research and make small quantities of new materials that we then test in OLED devices. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis). Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. Adesis currently operates in a facility of over 47,500 square feet in New Castle, Delaware and 7,000 square feet in Wilmington, Delaware. As of December 31, 2018, Adesis employed a team of 84 research and development chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. Although we expect to continue to utilize the majority of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, Adesis is expected to continue operating as a CRO in the above mentioned industries. As of December 31, 2018, we employed a team of 182 research scientists, engineers and laboratory technicians at our domestic and international facilities. This team includes chemists, physicists, engineers and technicians with physics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and organic/inorganic chemistry backgrounds, and highly-trained theoreticians and experimentalists. University Sponsored Research We have long-standing relationships with Princeton University and USC, dating back to 1994, for the conduct of research relating to our OLED and other organic thin-film technologies and materials for applications such as displays and lighting. This research had been performed at Princeton under the direction of Professor Forrest and at USC under the direction of Professor Thompson. In 2006, Professor Forrest transferred to the University of Michigan, where we continue to fund his research. We funded research at Princeton under a research agreement executed in 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire in 2007, after Professor Forrest transferred to Michigan. We have exclusive license rights to all OLED and other thin-film organic electronic patents (other than for organic photovoltaic solar cells) arising out of research conducted under that agreement. In connection with Professor Forrest’s transfer to Michigan, in 2006 we entered into a new sponsored research agreement with USC under which we are funding organic electronics research being conducted by Drs. Forrest and Thompson (the 2006 Research Agreement). Work by Professor Forrest is being funded through a subcontract between USC and Michigan. As with the 1997 Research Agreement, we have exclusive license rights to all OLED and thin-film organic electronic patents (other than for organic photovoltaic solar cells) arising out of this research. Effective May 1, 2017, we amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years. As of December 31, 2018, in connection with this amendment, we are obligated to reimburse the universities up to $4.1 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. In 2005, we entered into a separate sponsored research agreement with Princeton to fund research under the direction of Professor Sigurd Wagner on thin-film encapsulation and fabrication of OLED devices. This research was completed as of December 31, 2013. Like our other relationships with Princeton, we have exclusive license rights to all patents arising out of the research. We entered into a contract research agreement with the Chitose Institute of Science and Technology of Japan (CIST) in 2004. Under that agreement, we funded a research program headed by Professor Chihaya Adachi relating to high-efficiency OLED materials and devices. We were granted exclusive rights to all intellectual property developed under this program. Our relationship with CIST ended in 2006 when Professor Adachi transferred to Kyushu University. However, we have continued our relationship with Professor Adachi under a separate consulting arrangement. 10 In 2006 and 2007, we entered into one-year research agreements with Kyu ng Hee University to sponsor research programs on flexible, amorphous silicon thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane technology. The programs were directed by Professor Jin Jang. In 2008 and 2009, we entered into contract research agreements with Silicon Dis play Technology, Ltd. (SDT), a company founded by Professor Jang, and in 2013, we entered into another one-year agreement with SDT. We continue to maintain a good working relationship with Professor Jang. Aixtron In 2000, we entered into a development and license agreement with Aixtron AG of Aachen, Germany to develop and commercialize equipment used in the manufacture of OLEDs using the OVPD process. Under this agreement, we granted Aixtron an exclusive license to produce and sell its equipment for the manufacture of OLEDs and other devices using our proprietary OVPD process. Aixtron is required to pay us royalties on its sales of this equipment. Purchasers of the equipment also must obtain rights to use our proprietary OVPD process to manufacture OLEDs and other devices using the equipment, which they may do through us or Aixtron. If these rights are granted through Aixtron, Aixtron is required to make additional payments to us under our agreement. Aixtron has reported to us the delivery of nine OVPD systems since 2002. These include two second-generation systems, one of which was sold to the Fraunhofer Institute for Photonic Microsystems in Dresden, Germany in 2007, and the other of which was sold to RiTdisplay Corporation of Taiwan in 2003. We record royalty income from Aixtron’s sales of these various systems in the quarters in which Aixtron notifies us of the sale and the related royalties are due. U.S. Government-Funded Research We have entered into several U.S. government contracts and subcontracts to fund a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation OLED technologies. On contracts for which we were the prime contractor, we subcontract portions of the work to various entities and institutions. All of our government contracts and subcontracts are subject to termination at the election of the contracting governmental agency. Our government-funded programs are concentrated primarily in the area of solid-state lighting. In the past, we have received support for our work on flexible OLED technology through various U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) agencies, including the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), the Army Communications-Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) supports our work on white OLEDs for lighting, including through its Solid State Lighting (SSL) initiative. Several of our key U.S. government program initiatives in 2018 were as follows: Technology Development for OLED Lighting During 2018, we received funding from the DOE to work with the University of Michigan on a contract to develop technical approaches for using our proprietary PHOLED and other OLED technologies for high-efficiency white lighting applications. OLED Association We are a charter member of the OLED Association (OLED-A). OLED-A is a trade association whose mission involves serving as an OLED information resource, driving OLED technology development, and promoting interest in OLED products. We are one of 17 members of OLED-A, and we actively participate on its marketing and technology committees. Dr. Mike Hack, our Vice President of Business Development, serves as a member of the Board of Directors of OLED-A. Next Generation Lighting Industry Alliance We joined the Next Generation Lighting Industry Alliance (NGLIA) in 2009. NGLIA was formed in 2003 to foster industry-government partnership to accelerate the technical foundation, and ultimate commercialization, of solid state lighting systems. NGLIA was designated in 2005 as the “industry partner” by DOE for its SSL program. The SSL program is being undertaken to research, develop and conduct demonstration activities on advanced solid state white lighting technologies based on LEDs and OLEDs. We are one of 9 members of NGLIA. Dr. Hack is currently Vice-Chairman of NGLIA. 11 OLED Lighting Coalition We are a founding member of the OLED Lighting Coalition, a subgroup of OLED-A and NGLIA. The OLED Lighting Coalition is a group of U.S. companies and advocates of OLED technology joined together to promote the OLED lighting industry to the government, public and the lighting community. Dr. Hack serves as a member of the Board of Directors of the OLED Lighting Coalition. Intellectual Property Along with our personnel, our primary and most fundamental assets are patents and other intellectual property. This includes numerous U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications that we own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense. It also includes a substantial body of non-patented technical know-how that we have accumulated over time. Our Patents Our research and development activities, conducted both internally and through collaborative programs with our partners, have resulted in the filing of a substantial number of patent applications relating to our OLED technologies and materials. As of December 31, 2018, we owned, through assignment to us alone or jointly with others, 402 pending U.S. applications (active U.S. cases and international applications designated in the U.S.) and 837 U.S. patents, together with counterparts filed in various foreign countries. These owned patents will start expiring in the U.S. in 2020. Patents We License from Princeton, USC and Michigan We exclusively license many of our patent rights, including certain of our key PHOLED technology patents, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement. In 2006, based on Professor Forrest’s transfer to Michigan that year, Michigan was added as a party to this agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the patent rights we license from these universities included 228 issued U.S. patents, 61 pending U.S. patent applications, together with counterparts filed in various foreign countries. The earliest of these patents expired in the U.S. in 2014, while one of our U.S. PHOLED technology patents licensed from these universities expired in 2017. Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, Princeton, USC and Michigan granted us worldwide, exclusive license rights to specified patents and patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials (including our PHOLED technology and materials). Our license rights also extend to any patent rights arising out of the research conducted by Princeton, USC or Michigan under our various research agreements with these entities. We are free to sublicense to third parties all or any portion of our patent rights under the 1997 Amended License Agreement. The term of the 1997 Amended License Agreement continues for the lifetime of the licensed patents, though it is subject to termination for an uncured material breach or default by us, or if we become bankrupt or insolvent. Princeton is primarily responsible for the filing, prosecution and maintenance of all patent rights licensed to us under the 1997 Amended License Agreement pursuant to an inter-institutional agreement between Princeton, USC and Michigan. However, we manage this process and have the right to instruct patent counsel on specific matters to be covered in any patent applications filed by Princeton. We are required to bear all costs associated with the filing, prosecution and maintenance of these patent rights. We are required under the 1997 Amended License Agreement to pay Princeton royalties for licensed products sold by us or our sublicensees. These royalties amount to 3% of the net sales price for licensed products sold by us and 3% of the revenues we receive for licensed products sold by our sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the research agreements if Princeton reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. Princeton shares portions of these royalties with USC and Michigan under their inter-institutional agreement. We have a minimum royalty obligation of $100,000 per year during the term of the 1997 Amended License Agreement. We owed royalties under the 1997 Amended License Agreement with Princeton of $7.0 million for 2018. We also are required under the 1997 Amended License Agreement to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if we invest a minimum of $800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to us under the 1997 Amended License Agreement. Patents We Acquired from Motorola In 2000, we entered into a license agreement with Motorola whereby Motorola granted us perpetual license rights to what are now 74 issued U.S. patents relating to Motorola’s OLED technologies, together with foreign counterparts in various countries. These patents expired in the U.S. during 2018. 12 In 2011, we purchased these patents from Motorola, including all existing and future claims and causes of action for any infringement of the patents. This effectively terminated our license agreement with Motorola, including any obligation to make royalty payments to Motorola. In consideration for Motorola assigning and transferring the patents to us, we m ade a one-time cash payment to Motorola of $440,000, and we granted Motorola a royalty-free, non-exclusive and non-sublicensable license under the patents for use by Motorola and its affiliates in their respective businesses. Patents We Acquired from Fujifilm Corporation In 2012, we entered into a Patent Sale Agreement (the Fujifilm Agreement) with Fujifilm. Under the Fujifilm Agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $109.5 million. The Fujifilm Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The Fujifilm Agreement permitted us to assign all of our rights and obligations under the Fujifilm Agreement to our affiliates, and we assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement, our rights and obligations to UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), a wholly-owned subsidiary formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the Fujifilm Agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. Patents We Acquired from BASF In 2016, our Irish subsidiary UDC Ireland entered into an IP Transfer Agreement (the BASF Agreement) with BASF. Under the BASF Agreement, BASF sold us more than 500 OLED-related patents and patent applications for a total cost of $96.0 million. The transactions contemplated by the BASF Agreement were consummated on June 28, 2016. Intellectual Property Developed under Our Government Contracts We and our subcontractors have developed, and may continue to develop, patentable OLED technology inventions under our various U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. Under these arrangements, we or our subcontractors generally can elect to take title to any patents on these inventions, and to control the manner in which these patents are licensed to third parties. However, the U.S. government reserves rights to these inventions and associated technical data that could restrict our ability to market them to the government for military and other applications, or to third parties for commercial applications. In addition, if the U.S. government determines that we or our subcontractors have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of these inventions in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government may require that we or our subcontractors license these inventions to third parties in that field of use. Non-patented Technical Know-How We have accumulated, and continue to accumulate, a substantial amount of non-patented technical know-how relating to OLED technologies and materials. Where practicable, we share portions of this information with display manufacturers and other business partners on a confidential basis. We also employ various methods to protect this information from unauthorized use or disclosure, although no such methods can afford complete protection. Moreover, because we derive some of this information and know-how from academic institutions such as Princeton, USC and Michigan, there is an increased potential for public disclosure. We also cannot prevent the actual independent development of the same or similar information and know-how by third parties. Competition The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete against alternative display technologies, in particular LCDs, as well as other OLED technologies. We also compete in the lighting market against incumbent technologies, such as incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lamps, and inorganic LEDs, and against emerging technologies, such as other OLED technologies. Display Panel Industry Competitors Numerous domestic and foreign companies have developed or are developing and improving LCD and other display technologies that compete with our OLED display technologies. We believe that OLED display technologies can compete with LCDs and other display technologies for many product applications on the basis of lower power consumption, better contrast ratios, faster video rates, form factor and lower manufacturing cost. However, other companies may succeed in continuing to improve these competing display technologies, or in developing new display technologies, that are superior to OLED display technologies in various respects. We cannot predict the timing or extent to which such improvements or developments may occur. 13 Lighting Industry Competitors Although there has been a movement to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs throughout many countries, traditional incandescent bulbs and fluorescent lamps remain well-entrenched products in the lighting industry. In addition, compact fluorescent lamps and solid-state LEDs have been introduced into the market and would compete with OLED lighting products. Having attributes different from fluorescent lamps and LEDs, OLEDs may compete directly with these products for certain lighting applications. However, manufacturers of LEDs and compact fluorescent lamps may succeed in more broadly adapting their products to various lighting applications, or others may develop competing solid-state lighting technologies that are superior to OLEDs. Again, we cannot predict whether or when this might occur. OLED Technology and Materials Competitors Eastman Kodak Company (Kodak) developed and patented the original fluorescent OLED technology in 1987. Cambridge Display Technology, Ltd. (CDT), which was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical Company in 2007, developed and patented polymer OLED technology in 1989. Display and lighting manufacturers, including customers of ours, are engaged in their own OLED research, development and commercialization activities, and have developed and may continue to develop proprietary OLED technologies that are necessary or useful for commercial OLED devices. In addition, other material manufacturers, such as Sumitomo, Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. (Idemitsu Kosan), Merck KGaA, Cynora Gmbh and Kyulux Inc., are selling or sampling competing OLED materials to customers, including companies to which we sell our proprietary PHOLED materials. Our licensing business is based on our control of a broad portfolio of OLED-related device patents and technology. We believe this portfolio includes fundamental patents in the field of phosphorescent OLED materials and devices, as well as certain additional complementary OLED technologies. As discussed above, alternative technologies, such as fluorescent OLED emitter materials, exist and could be competitive to our phosphorescent OLED material solutions. However, fluorescent materials have characteristics that we believe many market participants consider less desirable than those of phosphorescent materials. Suppliers of fluorescent emitter materials include Doosan Electronics, Dow Chemical (previously Gracel Display), Idemitsu Kosan and SFC Co. Ltd. Fluorescent materials may also be viewed as complementary in that they can be used in the same OLED stack as phosphorescent materials, especially for use as emitters for generating deep blue pixels in display modules until such time as the OLED industry improves the properties of currently available deep blue phosphorescent materials. The competitive landscape with respect to our host materials business is characterized by a larger number of established chemical material suppliers who have long-term relationships with many of our existing customers and licensees. We have elected to partner with certain of these companies to manufacture and deliver host solutions to our customers, as well as selling our host materials directly to device manufacturers. We believe our competitive advantage stems, in part, from our deep knowledge of our phosphorescent emitter materials, which are complementary with the host solutions. We believe that our understanding of the phosphorescent emitter materials enables us to create host material solutions that are especially well suited for use with a certain class of emitter materials that are implemented commercially today. However, we note that many of our technology partners have their own host solutions and the competitive landscape includes many well-established companies such as Doosan Electronics, Dow Chemical, Duksan, Idemitsu Kosan, Merck KGaA, NSCC and Samsung SDI Co. Ltd. and which have significant resources and may aggressively pursue such business in the future. Our existing business relationships with SDC and other product manufacturers suggest that our OLED technologies and materials, particularly our PHOLED technologies and materials, may achieve a significant level of market penetration in the display and lighting industries. However, others, such as those working to develop thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and micro-LED alternative technologies, may succeed in developing new OLED technologies, materials and alternative solutions that may supplement or be utilized in place of ours. We cannot be sure of the extent to which product manufacturers will adopt and continue to utilize our OLED technologies and materials for the production of commercial displays and lighting products. Our Contract Research Organization Business: Adesis, Inc. Adesis, which we acquired in July 2016, is a contract research organization (CRO) headquartered in New Castle, Delaware that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2018, Adesis employed a team of 84 research and development chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries. 14 In May 2017, Adesis purchased its New Castle, Delaware building , to expand its custom organic synthesis, research and development, and specialty manufacturing capabilities. The New Castle facility is a 47,500-square-foot building in the Southgate Industrial Center, of which Adesis had previously leased about 25,100 sq uare feet. We believe the purchase of the building will allow Adesis to continue to expand its CRO offerings and allow us to enhance our chemistry expertise and capabilities. In December 2017, Adesis signed an agreement with Delaware Innovation Space, Inc. for approximately 7,000 square feet of laboratory space at the Experimental Station in Wilmington, Delaware, in which Adesis opened a new suite of laboratories to expand its organic chemistry team and research and development programs. The Wilmington space includes additional ancillary work and meeting space and supports Adesis’ ongoing operations. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had 265 active full-time employees and two part-time employees, none of whom are unionized. We believe that relations with our employees are good. Our Company History Our corporation was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1985. Our business was commenced in 1994 by a company then known as Universal Display Corporation, which had been incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey. In 1995, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours merged into this New Jersey corporation. The surviving corporation in this merger became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and changed its name to UDC, Inc. Simultaneously with the consummation of this merger, we changed our name to Universal Display Corporation. UDC, Inc. functions as an operating subsidiary of ours and has certain overlapping officers and directors. We have also formed or acquired other wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited (2008), Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H. (2010), Universal Display Corporation Japan GK (2011), UDC Ireland Limited (2012), Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. (2016) and Adesis, Inc. (2016), and we established a representative office in Taiwan (2011). Our Compliance with Environmental Protection Laws We are not aware of any material effects that compliance with Federal, State or local environmental protection laws or regulations will have on our business. We have not incurred substantial costs to comply with any environmental protection laws or regulations, and we do not anticipate having to do so in the foreseeable future. Our Internet Site Our Internet address is www.oled.com . We make available through our Internet website, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such material with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The SEC maintains a website that contains these reports as well as proxy statements and information regarding issuers who file electronically, with the address www.sec.gov . In addition, we have made available on our Internet website under the heading “Corporate Governance” the charter for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, the charter for the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors, the charter for the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, our Code of Ethics & Business Conduct for Employees, our Code of Conduct for Directors, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. We intend to make available on our website any future amendments or waivers to our Code of Ethics & Business Conduct for Employees and our Code of Conduct for Directors. The information on our Internet site is not part of this report. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. If we cannot obtain and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property protection for our OLED technologies and materials, our business will suffer. The value of our OLED technologies and materials is dependent on our ability to secure and maintain appropriate patent and other intellectual property rights protection. Although we own or license many patents respecting our OLED technologies and materials that have already been issued, there can be no assurance that additional patents applied for will be obtained, or that any of these patents, once issued, will afford commercially significant protection for our OLED technologies and materials, or will be found valid if challenged. Also, there is no assurance that we will be successful in defending the validity of our current or future patents in 15 pending and future patent oppositions, invalidation trials, interferences, reexaminations, reissues, or other administrati ve or court proceedings. Moreover, we have not obtained patent protection for some of our OLED technologies and materials in all foreign countries in which OLED products or materials might be manufactured or sold. We believe that the strength of our current intellectual property position results primarily from the essential nature of our fundamental patents covering phosphorescent OLED devices and certain materials utilized in these devices. Certain of our existing fundamental phosphorescent OLED patents expired in the United States in 2017 or will expire in the United States in 2019; and expired in other countries of the world in 2018 or will expire in other countries of the world in 2020. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend) beyond 2020, many of which are also of importance in the OLED industry, none are of an equally essential nature as our fundamental patents, and therefore our competitive position may be less certain as these patents expire. We may become engaged in litigation to protect or enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, or in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate the importation of goods that would compete unfairly with those of our licensees. In addition, we are participating in or have participated in, and in the future will likely have to participate in, interference, reissue, or reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and opposition, nullity or other proceedings before foreign patent offices, with respect to some of our patents or patent applications. All of these actions place our patents and other intellectual property rights at risk and may result in substantial costs to us as well as a diversion of management attention from our business and operations. Moreover, if successful, these actions could result in the loss of patent or other intellectual property rights protection for the key OLED technologies and materials on which our business depends. We rely, in part, on several non-patented proprietary technologies to operate our business. Others may independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Furthermore, these parties may obtain patent protection for such technology, inhibiting or preventing us from practicing the technology. To protect our trade secrets, know-how and other non-patented proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, financial advisors and strategic partners to enter into confidentiality agreements. These agreements may not ultimately provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other non-patented proprietary information. In particular, we may not be able to fully or adequately protect our proprietary information as we conduct discussions with potential strategic partners. Additionally, although we take many measures to prevent theft and misuse of our proprietary information, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems or to our intellectual property, which might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company or its products. If we are unable to protect the proprietary nature of our technologies, it will harm our business. We or our customers may incur substantial costs or lose important rights as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to our patent and other intellectual property rights or with respect to our OLED materials business. There are a number of other companies and organizations that have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials, including, without limitation, Kodak (substantially all of whose OLED assets were sold to a group of LG companies in 2009), CDT (acquired by Sumitomo in 2007), Canon, Inc., Semiconductor Energy Laboratories Co., Idemitsu Kosan and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation. In addition, some of our customers such as SDC and LG Display have been issued patents and are filing patent applications relating to OLED technologies and materials. As a result, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications of third parties that would be infringed by the use of our OLED technologies or materials, thus subjecting our customers to possible suits for patent infringement in the future. Such lawsuits could result in our customers being liable for damages or require our customers to obtain additional licenses that could increase the cost of their products. This, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our customers’ sales and thus our royalties or material sales revenues, or cause our customers to seek to renegotiate our royalty rates or pricing. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify customers purchasing our OLED materials for commercial usage against certain claims of patent infringement by third parties, as a result of which we may incur substantial legal costs in connection with defending these customers from such claims. Our licensees may also seek to avoid paying future royalties by attempting to have our patents declared invalid and unenforceable by a court. Our licensees may be more likely to file such declaratory actions in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc . (2007), in which the Court found that a licensee need not refuse to pay royalties and commit material breach of the license agreement before bringing an action to declare a licensed U. S. patent invalid and unenforceable. In addition, we may be required, from time-to-time, to assert our intellectual property rights by instituting legal proceedings against others. We cannot be assured that we will be successful in enforcing our patents in any lawsuits we may commence. Defendants in any litigation we may commence to enforce our patents may attempt to establish that our patents are invalid or are unenforceable. Thus, any patent litigation we commence could lead to a determination that one or more of our patents are invalid or unenforceable. If a third party succeeds in invalidating one or more of our patents, that party and others could compete more effectively against us. Our ability to derive licensing revenues from products or technologies covered by these patents would also be adversely affected. 16 Whether our customers are defending the assertion of third-party intellectual property rights against their businesses arising as a result of the use of our technology, or we are ass erting our own intellectual property rights against others, such litigation can be complex, costly, protracted and highly disruptive to our or our customers ’ business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical person nel. As a result, the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property litigation to which we or our customers are subject could disrupt business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and subject us or our customers to significant liabilities, each of which could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials continue to enter the consumer marketplace. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief in addition to money damages. Any intellectual property litigation commenced against our customers may force them to take actions that could be harmful to their businesses and thus to revenues, including the halting of sales of products that incorporate or otherwise use our technology or materials. Furthermore, the measure of damages in intellectual property litigation can be complex and is often subjective or uncertain. If our customers were to be found liable for infringement of proprietary rights of a third party, the amount of damages they might have to pay could be substantial and is difficult to predict. Decreased sales of our customers’ products incorporating our technology or materials would have an adverse effect on our royalty revenues under existing licenses and material sales under our existing sales agreements. Were this to occur, it would likely harm our ability to (i) obtain new licensees which would have an adverse effect on the terms of the royalty arrangements we could enter into with any new licensees, and (ii) sell our UniversalPHOLED® materials to existing and new customers. Moreover, to the extent any third party claims are directed specifically to materials supplied by us to our customers, we may be required to incur significant costs associated with the defense of such claims and potential damages associated with such claims that may be awarded against our customers. As is commonplace in technology companies, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other technology companies. To the extent our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees or we have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. The costs associated with these actions or the loss of rights critical to our or our customers’ businesses could negatively impact our revenues or cause our business to fail. Recent court decisions in various patent cases may make it more difficult for us to obtain future patents, enforce our patents against third parties or obtain favorable judgments in cases where the patents are enforced. Recent case law may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure future patents and/or enforce existing patents. For example, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc . (2007), the U.S. Supreme Court mandated a more expansive and flexible approach to determine whether a patent is obvious and invalid. As a result of the less rigid approach to assessing obviousness, defending the validity of or obtaining patents may be more difficult. Recent court decisions may also impact the enforcement of our patents. For example, we may not be able to enjoin certain third party uses of products or methods covered by our patents following the initial authorized sale, even where those uses are expressly proscribed in an agreement with the buyer. Also, we may face increased difficulty enjoining infringement of our patents. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that an injunction should not automatically issue based on a finding of patent infringement, but should be determined based on a test balancing considerations of the patentee’s interest, the infringer’s interest, and the public’s interest. Obtaining enhanced damages for willful infringement of our patents may also be more difficult even in those cases where we successfully prove a third party has infringed our patents, as a recent case set a more stringent standard for proving willful infringement. Therefore, as a result of such rulings, it may be more difficult for us to defend our currently issued patents, obtain additional patents in the future or achieve the desired competitive effect even when our patents are enforced. If we are unable to so defend our currently issued patents, or to obtain new patents for any reason, our business would suffer. If we cannot form and maintain lasting business relationships with OLED product manufacturers, our business strategy will fail. Our business strategy ultimately depends upon our development and maintenance of commercial licensing and material supply relationships with high-volume manufacturers of OLED products. We have entered into only a limited number of such relationships from which most of our material sales and licensing revenue are generated. Our other relationships with product manufacturers currently are limited to technology development and the evaluation of our OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial products. Some or all of these relationships may not succeed or, even if they are successful, may not result in the product manufacturers entering into commercial licensing and material supply relationships with us. 17 Many of our agreements with product manufacturers last for only limited periods of time, such that our relationships with these manufacturers will expire unl ess they are renewed. These product manufacturers may not agree to renew their relationships with us on a continuing basis or may agree to do so on terms that are less favorable to us. In addition, we regularly continue working with product manufacturers a fter our existing agreements with them have expired while we are attempting to negotiate contract extensions or new agreements with them. Should our relationships with the various product manufacturers not continue or be renewed on less favorable terms, or if we are not able to identify other product manufacturers and enter into contracts with them, our business may materially suffer. Our ability to enter into additional commercial licensing and material supply relationships, or to maintain our existing relationships, may depend on our ability to make certain financial or other commitments. We might not be able, for financial or other reasons, to enter into or continue these relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to do so may cause our business strategy to fail. If we fail to make advances in our OLED research and development activities, we might not succeed in commercializing our OLED technologies and materials. Further advances in our OLED technologies and materials depend, in part, on the success of the research and development work we conduct, both alone and with our research partners. We cannot be certain that this work will yield additional advances in the research and development of these technologies and materials. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies, including, without limitation, unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete research and development of our OLED technologies and materials successfully, or if we experience delays in completing research and development of our OLED technologies and materials for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. Conflicts or other problems may arise with our customers or joint development partners, resulting in renegotiation, breach or termination of, or litigation related to, our agreements with them. This would adversely affect our revenues. Conflicts or other problems could arise between us and our customers or joint development partners, some of which we have made strategic investments in, as to royalty rates, milestone payments or other commercial terms. Similarly, we may disagree with our customers or joint development partners as to which party owns or has the right to commercialize intellectual property that is developed during the course of the relationship or as to other non-commercial terms. If such a conflict were to arise, a customer or joint development partner might attempt to compel renegotiation of certain terms of their agreement or terminate their agreement entirely, and we might lose the royalty revenues, material sales revenues and other benefits of the agreement. Either we or the customer or joint development partner might initiate litigation to determine commercial obligations, establish intellectual property rights or resolve other disputes under the agreement. Such litigation could be costly to us and require substantial attention of management. If we were unsuccessful in such litigation, we could lose the commercial benefits of the agreement, be liable for financial damages and suffer losses of intellectual property or other rights that are the subject of dispute. If our OLED technologies and materials are not feasible for broad-based product applications, we may not be able to continue to generate revenues sufficient to support ongoing operations. Our main business strategy is to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials to manufacturers for incorporation into the display and lighting products that they sell. Consequently, our success depends on the ability and willingness of these manufacturers to develop, manufacture and sell commercial products integrating our technologies and materials. Before product manufacturers will agree to expand the use of our OLED technologies and materials for wider scale commercial production, they will likely require us to demonstrate to their satisfaction that our OLED technologies and materials are feasible for broad-based product applications beyond current commercial application, such as smartphones, wearables and television displays. This, in turn, may require additional advances in our technologies and materials, as well as those of others, for applications in a number of areas, including, without limitation, advances with respect to the development of: • OLED materials with improved lifetimes, efficiencies and color coordinates for larger area full-color OLED displays and general lighting products; • more robust OLED materials for use in more demanding large-scale manufacturing environments; and • scalable and cost-effective methods and technologies for the fabrication of large volume OLED materials and products. 18 We cannot be c ertain that these advances will occur, and hence our OLED technologies and materials may not be feasible for additional broad-based product applications and expansion. Even if our OLED technologies are technically feasible, they may not be adopted by product manufacturers. The potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities targeted by us are uncertain at this time. Market acceptance of our OLED technologies beyond current product offerings will depend, in part, upon these technologies providing benefits comparable or superior to current display and lighting technologies at an advantageous cost to manufacturers, and the adoption of products incorporating these technologies by consumers. Many current and potential customers for our OLED technologies utilize and have invested significant resources in competing technologies, and may, therefore, be reluctant to redesign their products or manufacturing processes to incorporate our OLED technologies. During the entire product development process for a new product, we face the risk that our technology will fail to meet the manufacturer’s technical, performance or cost requirements or will be replaced by a competing product or alternative technology. Even if we offer technologies that are satisfactory to a product manufacturer, the manufacturer may choose to delay or terminate its product development efforts for reasons unrelated to our technologies. In addition, our agreements with our customers do not require them to purchase our host materials in order to utilize our phosphorescent emitter materials, and those customers may elect not to purchase our host materials. Mass production of new mass market OLED products will require the availability of suitable manufacturing equipment, components and materials, many of which are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In addition, there may be a number of other technologies that manufacturers need to utilize in conjunction with our OLED technologies in order to bring these new OLED products to the market. Thus, even if our OLED technologies are a viable alternative to competing approaches, if product manufacturers are unable to obtain access to this equipment and these components, materials and other technologies, they may not utilize our OLED technologies. There are numerous potential alternatives to OLEDs, which may limit our ability to commercialize our OLED technologies and materials. The flat panel display market is currently, and will likely continue to be for some time, dominated by displays based on LCD technology. Numerous companies are making substantial investments in, and conducting research to improve characteristics of, LCDs; additionally, other competing flat panel display technologies have been, or are being, developed. A similar situation exists in the solid-state lighting market, which is currently dominated by LED products. Advances in any of these various technologies may overcome their current limitations and permit them to become the leading technologies in their field, either of which could limit the potential market for products utilizing our OLED technologies and materials. This, in turn, would cause product manufacturers to avoid entering into commercial relationships with us, or to terminate or not renew their existing relationships with us. Other OLED technologies may be more successful or cost-effective than ours, which may limit the commercial adoption of our OLED technologies and materials. Our competitors have developed and continue to develop OLED technologies that differ from or compete with our OLED technologies. In particular, competing fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescence OLED technology may become a viable alternative to our phosphorescent OLED technology. Moreover, our competitors may succeed in developing new OLED technologies that may become more cost-effective or have fewer limitations than our OLED technologies. If our OLED technologies, and particularly our phosphorescent OLED technology, are unable to capture a substantial portion of the OLED product market, our business strategy may fail. The consumer electronics industry experiences significant downturns from time to time, any of which may adversely affect the demand for and pricing of our OLED technologies and materials. Our success depends upon the ability and continuing willingness of our customers to manufacture and sell products utilizing our technologies and materials, specifically our phosphorescent emitters and host materials, and the widespread acceptance of our customers’ products in the consumer marketplace. Any slowdown in the demand for our customers’ products or a decrease in our customers’ use of or demand for our materials would adversely affect our material sales and royalty revenues and thus our business. Our customers’ decrease in the use of or demand for our materials may depend on several factors, including pricing, availability, continued technical improvements and competitive product offerings. The markets for flat panel displays and lighting products are highly competitive. Success in the market for end-user products that may integrate our OLED technologies and materials also depends on factors beyond the control of our customers and us, including the cyclical and seasonal nature of the end-user markets that our customers serve, as well as industry and general economic conditions. 19 The markets that we hope to penetrate have experienced significant periodic downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. These downturns have been characterized by lower product demand, production overcapacity and erosion of average selling prices. Our business strategy is dependent on manufacturers building and selling products that incorporate our OLED technologies and ma terials. Industry-wide fluctuations and downturns in the demand for displays and solid-state lighting products could cause significant harm to our business. Our customers may develop new or more efficient manufacturing processes, which may adversely affect demand for our OLED materials. OLED device manufacturing is in its early stages. By developing enhanced material processing methods and more efficient manufacturing techniques, our customers who purchase our phosphorescent emitter and host materials could become more efficient in the utilization of our materials, which could limit or reduce the amount of materials they purchase from us. Thus, demand for our materials may not expand in proportion to the number of OLED related products manufactured by our customers, and may result in reduced demand for our materials and technology relative to our customers' manufacture and sale of products made with such materials. Any downturn in U.S. or global economic conditions may have a significant adverse effect on our business. There have been significant and sustained economic downturns in the U.S. and globally in the past. These downturns have placed pressure on consumer demand, and the resulting impact on consumer spending has had a material adverse effect on the demand for consumer electronic products. Similar downturns in the future may have a significant adverse effect on one or more of our licensees as an enterprise, which could result in those licensees reducing their efforts to commercialize products that incorporate our OLED technologies and materials. Consumer demand and the condition of the display and lighting industries may also be impacted by other external factors such as war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties and other business interruptions. The impact of these external factors is difficult to predict, and one or more of these factors could adversely impact the demand for our customers’ products, and thus our business. Many of our competitors have greater resources, which may make it difficult for us to compete successfully against them. The flat panel display and solid-state lighting industries are characterized by intense competition. Many of our competitors have better name recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing, personnel and research capabilities than we do. Because of these differences, we may never be able to compete successfully in these markets or maintain any competitive advantages we are able to achieve over time. If we cannot keep our key employees or hire other talented persons as we grow, our business might not succeed. Our performance is substantially dependent on the continued services of our executive officers and other key technical and managerial personnel, and on our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to these and our other employees. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers or other key technical or managerial personnel. Additionally, competition for highly skilled technical and managerial personnel is intense. We might not be able to attract, hire, train, retain and motivate the highly skilled employees we need to be successful. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel, our business will suffer and might fail. We rely solely on PPG to manufacture the OLED materials we use and sell to product manufacturers. Our business prospects depend significantly on our ability to obtain proprietary OLED materials for our own use and for sale to product manufacturers. Our agreement with PPG provides us with a source for these materials for development, evaluation and commercial purposes. Our agreement with PPG currently runs through the end of 2019 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by us with prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG with prior notice of two years. Our inability to continue obtaining these OLED materials from PPG or another source at cost-competitive prices and to continue obtaining these OLED materials in sufficient quantities to meet our product manufacturers' current and future demands and timetables would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cost of goods sold relating to sales of these materials to OLED product manufacturers, as well as on our ability to perform future development work. We strive to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to accommodate our manufacturing customers. Inventory management relating to our material sales is complex, and excess inventory may harm our business and cause it to suffer. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels of our OLED materials to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. As a just-in-time supplier to our customers, we carry sufficient inventory to accommodate their capacity 20 requirements, sometimes without firm purchase commitments. Our dependence on third-party manufacturers to provide our materials to us e xposes us to longer lead times than if we were a direct manufacturer, increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence comparatively. Our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply and demand of their products by end-users, or the supply and demand of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them. Inventory management risks are heightened when our largest customers launch new products and retire existing products. At such times, these customers tend to change product designs and may introduce some of our new materials into new designs. The production of these materials requires us to purchase essential raw material and commence manufacturing well in advance of receiving firm customer orders for such materials. Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of unanticipated changes in our customers’ manufacturing plans and designs. Unanticipated product cessation and product introduction delays or cancellation may cause us to order or produce excess or insufficient inventory. Excess inventory of our OLED materials is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and inventory write downs. We are the sole source supplier for certain critical components used in OLED technologies, which subjects customers to risk if we are unable to meet the demand for such components. Our customers depend on us as the sole source for certain critical components used in manufacturing OLED products, which makes them susceptible to supply shortages if we are unable to meet their demand for such components. A potential customer could be hesitant to adopt OLED technology given the risks inherent in depending on a sole source for critical components and the inability to establish alternate supply relationships. If we are unable to supply the components needed by our existing customers in a timely manner, or if potential customers do not utilize OLED technology because of concerns about our ability to meet supply demands, our business may materially suffer. We may require additional funding in the future in order to continue our business. Our capital requirements have been and will continue to be significant. We may require additional funding in the future for the research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights in these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. Our cash on hand may not be sufficient to meet all of our future needs. When we need additional funds, such funds may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot obtain more money when needed, our business might fail. Additionally, if we attempt to raise money in an offering of shares of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants or depositary shares, or if we engage in acquisitions involving the issuance of such securities, the issuance of these shares will dilute our then-existing shareholders. Because the vast majority of OLED product manufacturers are located in the Asia-Pacific region, we are subject to international operational, financial, legal and political risks which may negatively impact our operations. Many of our customers and prospective customers have a majority of their operations in countries other than the United States, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. We also have offices in various countries located outside of the United States. Risks associated with our doing business outside of the United States include, without limitation: • compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including certain registration requirements for the OLED materials we sell; • legal uncertainties regarding taxes, tariffs, quotas, export controls, export licenses and other trade barriers; • economic instability in the countries of our customers, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our royalties; • political instability in the countries in which our customers operate, particularly in South Korea relating to its disputes with and proximity to North Korea and in Taiwan relating to its disputes with China; • difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and • potentially adverse tax and tariff consequences. Any of these factors could impair our ability to license our OLED technologies and sell our OLED materials, thereby harming our business. Compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. 21 We rely on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business and a cyb er-attack or other breach of our systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely, could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business. We are dependent on information technology systems to operate various elements of our business. A breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit important data and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties. As a result of this outsourcing, our third party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable. Data breaches of our information technology systems, or those of our third party vendors, may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. While we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems, and have been informed by our third party vendors that they have as well, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems, or those of our third party vendors, that could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has rights to intellectual property derived from our government-funded work that might prevent us from realizing the full benefits of our intellectual property portfolio. The U.S. government, through various government agencies, has provided and continues to provide funding to us, Princeton, USC and Michigan for work related to certain aspects of our OLED technologies. Because we have been provided with this funding, the government has rights to any intellectual property derived from this work that could restrict our ability to market OLED products to the government for military and other applications, or to license this intellectual property to third parties for commercial applications. Moreover, if the government determines that we have not taken effective steps to achieve practical application of this intellectual property in any field of use in a reasonable time, the government could require us to license this intellectual property to other parties in that field of use. Any of these occurrences would limit our ability to obtain maximum value from our intellectual property portfolio. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, as has been the case with our common stock in the past as well as the securities of many companies, particularly other emerging-growth companies in the technology industry. We have included in the section of this report entitled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,” a table indicating the high and low closing prices of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market for the past two years. Factors such as the following may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock in the future: • our revenues, expenses and operating results; • announcements by us, by our customers, or our competitors of technological developments, new product applications or contractual arrangements; • announcements relating to dividends and share repurchases; and • other factors affecting the flat panel display and solid-state lighting industries in general. Our operating results may have significant period-to-period fluctuations, which would make it difficult to predict our future performance. Due to the current stage of commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, the limited number of commercially successful consumer products utilizing our OLED technologies that customers have introduced in the marketplace, the relatively short product lifetimes of these consumer products, and the significant development and manufacturing objectives that we and our customers must achieve for the widespread inclusion of our OLED technologies in consumer products such as tablets, television displays and lighting products, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a reliable indicator of our future performance at this time. Among other factors affecting our period-to-period results, our license and technology development fees often consist of large one-time, annual or semi-annual payments, which may result in significant fluctuations in our revenues. In addition, our reliance on a small number of licensees with large volumes of consumer product sales makes our quarterly operating results subject to our licensee's specific plans and the success of their specific product offerings. 22 With respect to material sales, our sales are primarily depe ndent on purchases made by a small number of customers. In addition to the other factors described above relating to our customers’ sales opportunities, our quarter-to-quarter sales may be materially impacted by our customers’ inventory management plans, w hich may vary substantially based on financial management considerations, changes in their product mix plans, modified material processing techniques and manufacturing line modifications. If, in some future period, our operating results or business outlook fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price would be likely to decline and investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their purchase price. Broad market, industry and global economic factors may also materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The issuance of additional shares of our common stock could drive down the price of our stock. The price of our common stock could decrease if: • shares of our common stock that are currently subject to restriction on sale become freely salable, whether through an effective registration statement or based on Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; or • we issue additional shares of our common stock that might be or become freely salable, including shares that would be issued upon conversion of our preferred stock or the exercise of outstanding stock options. We can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of shareholders of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could: • adversely affect the voting power of the shareholders of our common stock; • make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us; • discourage bids for our common stock at a premium; or • otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of February 21, 2019, we have issued and outstanding 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock, all of which are held by an entity controlled by members of the family of Sherwin I. Seligsohn, our Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized and issued other shares of preferred stock in the past, none of which are currently outstanding, and may do so again at any time in the future. Any decisions to reduce or discontinue paying cash dividends to our shareholders could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. In 2017, our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, and we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends in the future. However, payment of future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As such, we may modify, suspend or cancel our cash dividend policy in any manner and at any time. Any reduction or discontinuance by us of the payment of quarterly cash dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Moreover, in the event our payment of quarterly cash dividends are reduced or discontinued, our failure or inability to resume paying cash dividends at historical levels could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which current shareholders purchased their shares. Our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including takeover attempts. Our executive officers and directors and their respective affiliates and the adult children of Sherwin Seligsohn, beneficially own, as of February 21, 2019, approximately 10.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these individuals may, as a practical matter, be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations. This concentration also could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us. 23 Natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could unfavorably affect our business. Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tsunamis, or earthquakes, particularly in Asia-Pacific region, where many of our customers are located, or the occurrence of other unforeseen catastrophic events, such a fire or flood, could unfavorably affect our business and financial performance. Such events could unfavorably affect our customers in many ways, such as causing physical damage to one or more of their properties, the temporary or permanent closure of one or more plants, the disruption or cessation of manufacturing of product lines, and the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply or demand for their products. A resulting by-product of such natural disasters or other unforeseen catastrophic events could be a temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of or demand for our products. Our effective tax rate may increase or decrease. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit by tax authorities where we do business. Although we believe that our tax estimates and tax positions are reasonable, they could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations, and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings and the realizability of deferred tax assets. An increase or decrease in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, at any time, U.S. federal tax laws or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be changed. In December 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which made widespread changes to the Internal Revenue Code, was signed into law. While we believe that this law generally will have a favorable effect on U.S. corporations and their shareholders, uncertainty remains regarding the full effect that this law will have on us, particularly given the global nature of our operations, or the impact on our customers, vendors, shareholders and other stakeholders. We also cannot predict whether, when or to what extent other new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be issued. As a result, changes in U.S. federal tax laws could negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and business operations, and adversely impact our shareholders. Occasionally, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted that may result in an increase in our tax liability. Shortfalls in tax revenues for states and municipalities in recent years may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate offices and research and development laboratories are located at 375 Phillips Boulevard in Ewing, New Jersey. In 2004, we acquired the building and property at which this facility is located. During 2005, we conducted a two-stage expansion of our laboratory and office space in the building, as well as a recent expansion in 2013 and 2015. We currently occupy the entire newly expanded facility. In 2017, we acquired the building and property at which the Adesis facility is located at 27 McCullough Drive in New Castle, Delaware. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. We believe that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. We view these proceedings as reflective of our goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. We believe that as OLED technology becomes more established and as our patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. 24 Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to us or which are now assigned to us. We do not believe that the confirmation, l oss or modification of our rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on our materials sales or licensing business or on our consolidated financial statements, includ ing our consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to our fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and we intend to vigorously defend ag ainst claims that, in our opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of our resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, we may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entries marked with an ""*"" relate to our UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of which may be commercialized by us. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to our white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. We believe the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and we have appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. This patent, as originally granted by the EPO, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that all or a significant portion of our claims should be upheld. However, we cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to our European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart patent to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to the U.S. Patents 7,001,536; 6,902,830; and 6,830,828 and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to us by Princeton, and we are required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, we appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. The patent, as originally granted by the EPO, is deemed to be valid during the pendency of the appeals process. Two of the three opponents also filed their own appeals of the ruling. In January 2015, Sumitomo withdrew its opposition of the '395 patent, and the EPO accepted the withdrawal notice. The appeal proceedings were held in the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the proceedings, the board concluded the oral proceedings and proposed to reinstate a broader set of claims pending the resolution of a remaining question of the applicable law, a question that the board has deferred to the Enlarged Board of Appeals for review. In December 2017, the Enlarged Board of Appeals issued a written opinion in which they have generally followed our reasoning regarding the question of law. The written opinion should be used as guidance by the EPO opposition panel when the oral proceedings are rescheduled. The originally-granted claims remain in force during the pendency of this process. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, we may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents we acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. 25 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our executive officers as of February 21, 2019: Name Age Position Sherwin I.

(2) During the second quarter of 2015, the Company experienced a faster-than-anticipated decline in host material sales, which we believe was a result of our customer's selling new products that did not include our host materials. Based on the most recent sales forecast, we determined that there were likely to be significantly lower sales of our existing host material. As such, a write-down in net realizable value of our inventory of $33.0 million during the second quarter of 2015 was required. 30 ITEM 7. MA NAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled “Selected Financial Data” in this report and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes to this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, as more fully discussed in Item 1A of this report, entitled “Risk Factors.” OVERVIEW We are a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode, or OLED, technologies and materials for use in displays for mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive applications, as well as specialty and general lighting products. Since 1994, we have been exclusively engaged, and expect to continue to be primarily engaged, in funding and performing research and development activities relating to OLED technologies and materials, and commercializing these technologies and materials. We derive our revenue primarily from the following: • sales of OLED materials for evaluation, development and commercial manufacturing; • intellectual property and technology licensing; • contract research services in the areas of organic and organometallic materials synthesis research, development and commercialization; and • technology development and support, including government contract work and support provided to third parties for commercialization of their OLED products. Material sales relate to our sale of OLED materials for incorporation into our customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. We receive license and royalty payments under certain commercial, development and technology evaluation agreements, some of which are non-refundable advances. These payments may include royalty and license fees made pursuant to license agreements and also license fees included as part of certain commercial supply agreements. These payments are included in the estimate of total contract consideration by customer and recognized as revenue over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the current supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company expects to generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. 31 In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agree ment calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company has also agreed to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. In 2016, we acquired Adesis, Inc. (Adesis) with operations in New Castle, Delaware. Adesis is a contract research organization (CRO) that provides support services to the OLED, pharma, biotech, catalysis and other industries. As of December 31, 2018, Adesis employed a team of 84 research scientists, chemists, engineers and laboratory technicians. Prior to our acquisition in 2016, we utilized more than 50% of Adesis’ technology service and production output. We continue to utilize a significant portion of its technology research capacity for the benefit of our OLED technology development, and Adesis uses the remaining capacity to operate as a CRO in the above-mentioned industries providing contract research services to those third party customers. Contract research services is revenue earned by performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. We also generate technology development and support revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which include reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs we incur in relation to our government contracts. Revenues are recognized as services are performed, proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved. We anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding, among other factors: • the timing, cost and volume of sales of our OLED materials; • the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties, as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation; • the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development and patent-related activities; and • the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and other financial information. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions. We believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred revenue, inventories and income taxes, as described below, are our “critical accounting policies” as contemplated by the SEC. These policies, which have been reviewed with our Audit Committee, are discussed in greater detail below. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. 32 The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses a nd materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized ove r the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalti es to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis through performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the client is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and commercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research and development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved, and are included in contract research services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The Company records taxes billed to customers and remitted to various governmental entities on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of material sales in the consolidated statements of income. The amounts of these pass-through taxes reflected in revenues and cost of material sales were $117,000, $409,000, and $171,000 in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Accounting for Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions for future realization and determining our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of our assessment we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, based on previous earnings history, a current evaluation of expected future taxable income and other evidence, we determined to retain the valuation allowance that relates to New Jersey research and development credits. Actual results could differ from our assessments if adequate taxable income is generated in future periods. To the extent we establish a new valuation allowance or change a previously established valuation allowance in a future period, income tax expense will be impacted. 33 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (Decrease) Increase REVENUE $ 247,414 $ 335,629 $ (88,215 ) COST OF SALES 53,541 54,698 (1,157 ) Gross margin 193,873 280,931 (87,058 ) OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 53,717 49,144 4,573 Selling, general and administrative 46,999 46,808 191 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 21,962 21,983 (21 ) Patent costs 7,464 7,010 454 Royalty and license expense 6,996 9,739 (2,743 ) Total operating expenses 137,138 134,684 2,454 OPERATING INCOME 56,735 146,247 (89,512 ) Interest income, net 7,659 3,294 4,365 Other expense, net (83 ) (4 ) (79 ) Interest and other expense, net 7,576 3,290 4,286 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 64,311 149,537 (85,226 ) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (5,471 ) (45,652 ) 40,181 NET INCOME $ 58,840 $ 103,885 $ (45,045 ) Revenue During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue of $247.4 million, a decrease of $88.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of the impact of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606 and lower material sales. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $78.9 million lower than what would have been recorded under ASC 605. Under ASC 606, we recognize license fee revenue on a material units sold basis in contrast to our recognizing license fee revenue either upon a straight-line basis or upon receipt of payment that was required under ASC 605. The decrease in revenue was also the result of near-term weakness in the mobile display segment of the OLED display market that primarily impacted our first quarter results. Despite the near-term weakness in this segment, we believe the overall OLED display market will continue to grow as expected. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 95% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to 97% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $1.2 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to the decline in the level of material sales. Included in the cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an excess and obsolete inventory charge of $3.6 million due to lower than anticipated customer demand. As a result of the impact of ASC 606 and the decline in material sales, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $87.1 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 with gross margin as a percentage of sales decreasing to 78% from 84%, respectively. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $53.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher operating costs, including increased contract research activity. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher employee-related compensation expenses. 34 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets was $22.0 million for both of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Patent costs Patent costs increased to $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense decreased to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to decreased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC, and Michigan, resulting from a decrease in qualifying material sales. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest income, net and other expense, net Interest income, net was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2018 over amounts held in the comparable period in 2017. Other expense, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. We recorded other expense, net of $83,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to other expense, net of $4,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 8.5% and 30.5% for the years ended December 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and we recorded income tax expense of $5.5 million and $45.7 million, respectively. The recorded amounts include deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation costs (“windfalls”) under ASU No. 2016-09 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and a one-time charge of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflected benefits from a higher research and development credit, the reversal of the repatriation tax recorded in 2017 and a foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII). Without the $1.1 million benefit of ASU No. 2016-09, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 10.2% and $6.6 million, respectively. Without the benefit of ASU No. 2016-09 and the enactment of the TCJA, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate and income expense would have been 24.8%, and $37.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company incurred Korean withholding tax of $14.9 million and $17.6 million, respectively, which is currently being appealed based on the interpretation of the Korean – U. S. tax treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. 35 Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 201 7 and 201 6 Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Increase (Decrease) REVENUE $ 335,629 $ 198,886 $ 136,743 COST OF SALES 54,698 26,288 28,410 Gross margin 280,931 172,598 108,333 OPERATING EXPENSES: Research and development 49,144 42,744 6,400 Selling, general and administrative 46,808 32,876 13,932 Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets 21,983 16,493 5,490 Patent costs 7,010 6,249 761 Royalty and license expense 9,739 5,823 3,916 Total operating expenses 134,684 104,185 30,499 OPERATING INCOME 146,247 68,413 77,834 Interest income, net 3,294 2,113 1,181 Other expense, net (4 ) (1,928 ) 1,924 Interest and other expense, net 3,290 185 3,105 INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 149,537 68,598 80,939 INCOME TAX EXPENSE (45,652 ) (20,528 ) (25,124 ) NET INCOME $ 103,885 $ 48,070 $ 55,815 Revenue Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $136.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue was the result of an increase in material sales due to an increase in sales volume resulting from higher demand for both red and green phosphorescent emitters. Revenue derived from OLED sales comprised 97% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 98% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining portion of our revenue was derived from contract research services. Contract research services include revenue earned by our subsidiary, Adesis, which performs organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis for our customers. Cost of Sales Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $28.4 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 and was primarily due to an increase in the level of material sales. As a result, gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $108.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 with gross margin as a percentage of sales decreasing to 84% from 87%, respectively. Research and development Research and development expenses increased to $49.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $42.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher third-party contract research activities as well as higher employee-related costs. Selling, general and administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $32.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to incremental costs associated with the addition of Adesis activity, as well as higher employee-related costs and other operating expenses. Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets Amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets increased to $22.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to higher amortization expense of $5.5 million associated with the acquisitions of the BASF patent portfolio and intangible assets associated with the Adesis acquisition. See Note 8 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 36 Patent costs Patent costs increased to $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Royalty and license expense Royalty and license expense increased to $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due to increased royalties incurred under our amended license agreement with Princeton, USC, and Michigan, resulting from an increase in royalty and license fees and qualifying material sales. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Interest income, net and other expense, net Interest income, net, was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in interest income, net was primarily due to the increase in available-for-sale investments held during the year ended December 31, 2017 over amounts held in the comparable period in 2016. Other expense, net primarily consisted of net exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. We recorded other expense, net of $4,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to other expense, net of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Other expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consisted of exchange losses on foreign currency associated with the BASF OLED patent acquisition. Income tax expense We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The effective income tax rate was 30.5% and 29.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and the Company recorded income tax expense of $45.7 million and $20.5 million, respectively. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflected a benefit from the utilization of a valuation allowance at UDC Ireland. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a one-time charge of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter. The charge includes two elements, a tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Without the TCJA, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 22.8% and $34.2 million. On January 1, 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Accounting , which includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. Under the previous guidance, tax effects of deductions for employee share awards in excess of compensation cost (""windfalls"") were recorded in equity in the period in which the deductions actually reduced income taxes payable and any unrecognized tax benefits were tracked separately off the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are recorded in the income statement in the period in which stock awards vest or are settled, and any excess tax benefits not previously recognized because the related tax deduction had not reduced current taxes payable are recorded through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption. Without the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 and the enactment of TCJA, for the year ended December 31, 2017, the effective income tax rate and income tax expense would have been 24.8% and $37.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred Korean withholding tax of $17.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively, which is currently being appealed based on the interpretation of the Korean – U. S. tax treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our investments. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $211.0 million and short-term investments of $304.3 million, for a total of $515.3 million. This compares to cash and cash equivalents of $132.8 million, short-term investments of $287.5 million and long-term investments of $14.8 million, for a total of $435.1 million, as of December 31, 2017. Cash provided by operating activities was $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $133.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $11.6 million was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash adjustments to net income of $89.5 million and a decrease in net income of 37 $4 5 . 0 million. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash due to changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $1 2 2 . 9 million, which included an increase in defe rred revenue and other liabilities and a decrease in deferred income taxes and accounts receivable, partially offset by an increase in other assets and inventory . The increase in the balances of other assets and other liabilities is due to the anticipated favorable settlement with the Korean tax authorities. Cash used in investing activities was $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to cash used in investing activities of $125.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million was primarily due to the timing of maturities and purchases of investments resulting in net sales of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to net purchases of $95.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and a decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease in property, plant, and equipment purchases was primarily due to the expansion of our OLED manufacturing facility managed by our subcontractor PPG in Ohio during 2017, partially offset by the purchase of research and development lab equipment as well as expansion of our Adesis manufacturing facility in Delaware during 2018. Cash used in financing activities was $22.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $14.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in cash used in financing activities of $8.3 million was due to an increase in the cash payment of dividends in the current year of $5.7 million, an increase in the payment of withholding taxes related to stock-based compensation to employees of $2.2 million and repurchase of common stock of $477,000, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $64,000. Working capital was $501.7 million as of December 31, 2018, compared to $455.4 million as of December 31, 2017. The increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents, inventory and short-term investments, partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and other current liabilities and a decrease in accounts receivable. We anticipate, based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations (including, among others, assumptions regarding our working capital requirements, the progress of our research and development efforts, the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work, and the timing and costs associated with the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications), that we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next twelve months. We believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long-term and short-term borrowings, public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. It should be noted, however, that additional funding may be required in the future for research, development and commercialization of our OLED technologies and materials, to obtain, maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials, and for working capital and other purposes, the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, particularly in the current economic environment. Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2018, we had the following contractual commitments: Payments due by period (in thousands) Contractual Obligations Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years Estimated retirement plan benefit payments $ 65,363 $ — $ 7,191 $ 8,549 $ 49,623 Lease obligations 10,852 2,320 2,747 1,743 4,042 Purchasing obligations 15,858 15,858 — — — Research related obligations 6,532 4,921 1,611 — — Minimum royalty obligation (1) 500 100 200 200 $100/year Total (2) $ 99,105 $ 23,199 $ 11,749 $ 10,492 $ 53,665 (1) Under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Princeton minimum royalties of $100,000 per year until the agreement is no longer in effect. The agreement has no scheduled expiration date. (2) See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in our control. 38 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities (or similar arrangements serving as credit, liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets), or obligations (including contingent obligations) arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engage in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments, other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our investments disclosed in “Fair Value Measurements” in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We generally invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments. Our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates, which would impact interest income earned on investments. However, based upon the conservative nature of our investment portfolio and current experience, we do not believe a decrease in investment yields would have a material negative effect on our interest income. Substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of North America. All revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes to those statements are attached to this report beginning on page F-1. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, are effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. However, a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based upon criteria in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018, based on the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, has been attested to by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears on the following page. Steven V. Abramson President and Chief Executive Officer Sidney D. Rosenblatt Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer February 21, 2019 F-2 REPORT OF INDE PENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 21, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP Philadelphia, Pennsylvania February 21, 2019 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Universal Display Corporation: Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Universal Display Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 21, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company adopted the standard effective January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective adoption method. Also, the Company elected to change its method of accounting for share-based payment transactions in 2017 due to the adoption of amendments to the FASB ASC resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, effective January 1, 2017. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-9 UNIVERSAL DISPLAY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. BUSINESS: Universal Display Corporation (the Company) is a leader in the research, development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode (OLED) technologies and materials for use in display and solid-state lighting applications. OLEDs are thin, lightweight and power-efficient solid-state devices that emit light that can be manufactured on both flexible and rigid substrates, making them highly suitable for use in full-color displays and as lighting products. OLED displays are capturing a growing share of the display market. The Company believes this is because OLEDs offer potential advantages over competing display technologies with respect to power efficiency, contrast ratio, viewing angle, video response time, form factor and manufacturing cost. The Company also believes that OLED lighting products have the potential to replace many existing light sources in the future because of their high power efficiency, excellent color rendering index, low operating temperature and novel form factor. The Company's technology leadership and intellectual property position should enable it to share in the revenues from OLED displays and lighting products as they enter mainstream consumer and other markets. The Company's primary business strategy is to (1) further develop and license its proprietary OLED technologies to manufacturers of products for display applications, such as mobile phones, televisions, tablets, wearables, portable media devices, notebook computers, personal computers, and automotive interiors, and specialty and general lighting products; and (2) develop new OLED materials and sell existing and any new materials to those product manufacturers. The Company has established a significant portfolio of proprietary OLED technologies and materials, primarily through internal research and development efforts and acquisitions of patents and patent applications, as well as maintaining its relationships with world-class partners such as Princeton University (Princeton), the University of Southern California (USC), the University of Michigan (Michigan) and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG). The Company currently owns, exclusively licenses or has the sole right to sublicense more than 5,000 patents issued and pending worldwide. The Company sells its proprietary OLED materials to customers for evaluation and use in commercial OLED products. The Company also enters into agreements with manufacturers of OLED display and lighting products under which it grants them licenses to practice under its patents and to use the Company's proprietary know-how. At the same time, the Company works with these and other companies who are evaluating the Company's OLED technologies and materials for possible use in commercial OLED display and lighting products. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Universal Display Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries, UDC, Inc., UDC Ireland Limited, Universal Display Corporation Hong Kong, Limited, Universal Display Corporation Korea, Y.H., Universal Display Corporation Japan GK, Universal Display Corporation China, Ltd. and Adesis, Inc. (Adesis). All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. Business Combinations Accounting for acquisitions requires the Company to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, the estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which is when all information necessary is obtained not to exceed one year, adjustments may be recorded to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the consolidated statements of income. Management’s Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The estimates made are principally in the areas of revenue recognition including estimates of material unit sales and royalties, the useful life of acquired intangibles, the use and recoverability of inventories, intangibles and income taxes including realization of deferred tax assets, stock-based compensation and retirement benefit plan liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-10 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Trade Accounts Receivable Trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect and do not bear interest. The Company considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer accounts: customer credit-worthiness, past transaction history with the customer, current economic industry trends, and changes in customer payment terms. The Company’s accounts receivable balance is a result of chemical sales, royalties and license fees. These receivables have historically been paid timely. Due to the nature of the accounts receivable balance, the Company believes there is no significant risk of collection. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, adversely affecting their ability to make payments, allowances for doubtful accounts would be required. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $77,000, none and $100,000 at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Inventories Inventories consist of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods, including inventory consigned to customers, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out basis, or net realizable value. Inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon management’s analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. A 12-month rolling forecast based on factors, including, but not limited to, production cycles, anticipated product orders, marketing forecasts, backlog, and shipment activities is used in the inventory analysis. If market conditions are less favorable than forecasts or actual demand from customers is lower than estimates, additional inventory write-downs may be required. If demand is higher than expected, inventories that had previously been written down may be sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of thirty years for building, fifteen years for building improvements, and three to seven years for office and lab equipment and furniture and fixtures. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions and betterments are capitalized. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements, maintenance, and repairs are charged to current operations as incurred. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in other operating expenses. Certain costs of computer software obtained for internal use are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. Costs for maintenance and training, as well as the cost of software that does not add functionality to an existing system, are expensed as incurred. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Company management continually evaluates whether events or changes in circumstances might indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived assets may warrant revision, or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows in measuring whether the long-lived asset should be written down to fair value. Measurement of the amount of impairment would be based on generally accepted valuation methodologies, as deemed appropriate. As of December 31, 2018, Company management believed that no revision to the remaining useful lives or write-down of the Company’s long-lived assets was required, and similarly, no such revisions were required for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. Company management first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether a quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary. If it is concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment F-11 assessment is not necessary. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, then its carrying value is written down to fair value. The goodwill impairment test involves a two-step process. The first step, identifying a potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step would need t o be conducted; otherwise, no further steps are necessary as no potential impairment exists. If necessary, the second step to measure the impairment loss would be to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Any excess of the reporting unit goodwill carrying value over the respective implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. The Company performed its annual impairment asse ssment as of December 31, 201 8 utilizing a qualitative evalu ation and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of Adesis (see Note 3) is great er than its carrying value. Company management believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fa ir value of the reporting un it. Future impairment tests will continue to be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs. As o f December 31, 201 8 , no indications of impairment exist ed . Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying values of accounts receivable, other current assets, and accounts payable approximate fair value in the accompanying financial statements due to the short-term nature of those instruments. The Company’s other financial instruments, which include cash equivalents and investments, are carried at fair value. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. The Company uses valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue Material sales relate to the Company’s sale of its OLED materials for incorporation into its customers’ commercial OLED products or for their OLED development and evaluation activities. Material sales are recognized at the time title passes, which is typically at the time of shipment or at the time of delivery, depending upon the contractual agreement between the parties. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold during the period at their estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process and related amounts to be charged. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Contract research services revenue is revenue earned by Adesis through performing organic and organometallic synthetics research, development and commercialization on a contractual basis. These services range from intermediates for structure-activity relationship studies, reference agents and building blocks for combinatorial synthesis, re-synthesis of key intermediates, specialty organic chemistry needs, and selective toll manufacturing. These services are provided to third-party pharmaceutical and life sciences firms and other technology firms at fixed costs or on an annual contract basis. Revenue is recognized as services are performed with billing schedules and payment terms negotiated on a contract-by-contract basis. Payments received in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue. In other cases, services may be provided and revenue is recognized before the customer is invoiced. In these cases, revenue recognized will exceed amounts billed and the difference, representing amounts which are currently unbillable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms, is recorded as an unbilled receivable. F-12 Technology development and support revenue is revenue earned from government contracts, development and technology evaluation agreements and comm ercialization assistance fees, which includes reimbursements by government entities for all or a portion of the research and development costs the Company incurs in relation to its government contracts. Revenues are recognized proportionally as research an d development costs are incurred, or as defined milestones are achieved, and are included in contract research services in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In 2018, the Company entered into a commercial license agreement with Samsung Display Co., Ltd. (SDC). This agreement, which covers the manufacture and sale of specified OLED display materials, was effective as of January 1, 2018 and lasts through the end of 2022 with an additional two-year extension option. Under this agreement, the Company is being paid a license fee, payable in quarterly installments over the agreement term of five years. The agreement conveys to SDC the non-exclusive right to use certain of the Company's intellectual property assets for a limited period of time that is less than the estimated life of the assets. At the same time the Company entered into the current patent license agreement with SDC, the Company also entered into a new supplemental material purchase agreement with SDC. Under the current supplemental material purchase agreement, SDC agrees to purchase from the Company a minimum amount of phosphorescent emitter materials for use in the manufacture of licensed products. This minimum commitment is subject to SDC’s requirements for phosphorescent emitter materials and the Company’s ability to meet these requirements over the term of the supplemental agreement. In 2015, the Company entered into an OLED patent license agreement and an OLED commercial supply agreement with LG Display Co., Ltd. (LG Display) which were effective as of January 1, 2015 and superseded the existing 2007 commercial supply agreement between the parties. The new agreements have a term that is set to expire by the end of 2022. The patent license agreement provides LG Display a non-exclusive, royalty bearing portfolio license to make and sell OLED displays under the Company's patent portfolio. The patent license calls for license fees, prepaid royalties and running royalties on licensed products. The agreements include customary provisions relating to warranties, indemnities, confidentiality, assignability and business terms. The agreements provide for certain other minimum obligations relating to the volume of material sales anticipated over the life of the agreements as well as minimum royalty revenue to be generated under the patent license agreement. The Company expects to generate revenue under these agreements that are predominantly tied to LG Display’s sales of OLED licensed products. The OLED commercial supply agreement provides for the sale of materials for use by LG Display, which may include phosphorescent emitters and host materials. In 2016, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Tianma Micro-electronics Co., Ltd. (Tianma). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Tianma non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Tianma for use in its licensed products. In 2017, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year agreements with BOE Technology Group Co., Ltd. (BOE). Under these agreements, the Company has granted BOE non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The Company has also agreed to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to BOE. In 2018, the Company entered into long-term, multi-year OLED patent license and material purchase agreements with Visionox Technology, Inc. (Visionox). Under the license agreement, the Company has granted Visionox non-exclusive license rights under various patents owned or controlled by the Company to manufacture and sell OLED display products. The license agreement calls for license fees and running royalties on licensed products. Additionally, the Company expects to supply phosphorescent OLED materials to Visionox for use in its licensed products. The Company records taxes billed to customers and remitted to various governmental entities on a gross basis in both revenues and cost of material sales in the consolidated statements of income. The amounts of these pass through taxes reflected in revenues and cost of material sales were $117,000, $409,000 and $171,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. All sales transactions are billed and due within 90 days and substantially all are transacted in U.S. dollars. See Recent Accounting Pronouncements for discussion of revenue recognition under the new standard, which became effective January 1, 2018. F-13 Cost of Sales Cost of sales consists of labor and material costs associated with the production of materials processed at the Company's manufacturing partners and at the Company's internal manufacturing processing facilities. The Company’s portion of cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing equipment, as well as manufacturing overhead costs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory. Research and Development Expenditures for research and development are charged to operations as incurred. Patent Costs Costs associated with patent applications, patent prosecution, patent defense and the maintenance of patents are charged to expense as incurred. Costs to successfully defend a challenge to a patent are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patent. Costs that relate to an unsuccessful outcome are charged to expense. Amortization of Acquired Technology Amortization costs relate to technology acquired from BASF, Fujifilm and Motorola. These acquisitions were completed in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Acquisition costs are being amortized over a period of 10 years for the BASF and Fujifilm patents and 7.5 years for the Motorola patents. Amortization of Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets from the Adesis acquisition are being amortized over a period of 10 to 15 years. See Notes 3 and 8 for further discussion. Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements and Foreign Currency Transactions The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company's Ireland subsidiary is also the U.S. dollar and the functional currency for each of the Company's Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries is its local currency. The Company translates the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income from its Asia-Pacific foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates, which the Company believes are representative of the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. The Company's foreign subsidiaries' assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at the actual exchange rates as of the end of each reporting date, and the Company records the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The overall effect of the translation of foreign currency and foreign currency transactions to date has been insignificant. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount of which the likelihood of realization is greater than 50%. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. The Company records interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. Share-Based Payment Awards The Company recognizes in the consolidated statements of income the grant-date fair value of equity based awards such as shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance unit awards issued to employees and directors. The grant-date fair value of stock awards is based on the closing price of the stock on the date of grant. The fair value of share-based awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of forfeitures. The Company issues new shares upon the respective grant, exercise or vesting of the share-based payment awards, as applicable. F-14 Performance unit awards are subject to either a performance-based or market-based vesting requirement. For performance-based vesting, the grant-date fair value of the award, based on fair value of the Company's common stock, is recognized over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved and compensation expense is periodically adjusted based on actual and expected performance. Compensation expense for performance unit awards wit h market-based vesting is calculated based on the estimated fair value as of the grant date utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized over the service period on a straight-line basis. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new revenue recognition standard entitled Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The objective of the standard is to establish the principles that an entity shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from a contract with a customer. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2018 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The new standard impacts how the Company recognizes revenue on its commercial license and material supply agreements with customers. In addition, the Company previously recognized royalty revenue one quarter in arrears based on sales information received from its customers typically received after disclosing that quarter’s results. Under ASC Topic 606, royalties to be earned over the contract term are estimated as part of total contract consideration and recognized as noted below. The estimates are updated on a quarterly basis. The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. These agreements are combined and the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at its estimated per unit fee. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of $21.3 million offset by a reduction of retained earnings of $17.1 million, net of tax of $3.9 million, and unbilled receivables of $0.3 million as of January 1, 2018. The impact of the new standard to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease of $78.9 million from the amount that would have been recorded under the prior accounting standard. See Note 19 for further discussion. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases , which addresses the classification and recognition of lease assets and liabilities. The guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition and measurement, and quantitative and qualitative aspects of presentation and disclosure. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt the standard on January 1, 2019. The Company estimates that adoption of the new standard will result in a reduction in retained earnings of $592,000, net of tax of $157,000, offset by increases in net property and equipment of $7.0 million, other current liabilities of $1.3 million and other liabilities of $6.5 million. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . The objective of the standard is to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The ASU provides additional clarification guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017 and did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 clarifies the accounting for the current and deferred income taxes for an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017 and did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test of Goodwill Impairment, eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value, essentially eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. The new standard requires goodwill impairment to be based upon the results of step one of the impairment test, which is defined as the excess of the carrying value of a reporting unit over its fair value. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The standards update is effective prospectively for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing performed in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that adoption of ASU 2017-04 may have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. F-15 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting . ASU 2017-09 clarifies which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modific ation accounting, in accordance with Topic 718. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and requires a prospective application to awards modified on or after the adoption date. The Comp any has not historically made changes to the terms or conditions of shared-based payment awards and the adoption of ASU 2017-09, beginning January 1, 2018, did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: On June 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire Adesis, Inc., a privately held contract research organization (CRO) with then 43 employees specializing in organic and organometallic synthetic research, development, and commercialization. Adesis is a technology vendor to companies in the pharmaceutical, fine chemical, biomaterials, and catalyst industries, and had worked with the Company prior to the acquisition to help advance and accelerate a number of the Company’s product offerings. The transaction closed on July 11, 2016. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company’s subsidiary, UDC, Inc., acquired all outstanding shares of Adesis in a merger for $33.9 million in cash, and up to an additional $2.4 million in cash contingent upon Adesis’ achievement of certain milestones within two years of the acquisition. The acquisition was funded through use of existing cash and investments. Purchase Price Allocation The Company accounted for Adesis using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with applicable GAAP whereby the total purchase price was allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on respective fair values. The contingent consideration arrangement required the Company to pay up to $1.2 million of additional consideration to the former shareholders of Adesis if revenues exceeded certain threshold levels at the end of each twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. For both of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the additional cash consideration earned by the former shareholders of Adesis was $1.2 million. The fair value of the contingent consideration was derived using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on management’s projections of future revenue levels. The following table summarizes the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition (in thousands): Cash consideration $ 33,872 Contingent consideration 1,670 $ 35,542 Allocation of purchase price: Current assets, including cash of $492 $ 2,204 Property and equipment 1,869 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities (906 ) Net tangible assets 3,167 Identifiable intangible assets 16,840 Goodwill 15,535 Total purchase price $ 35,542 The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and, as a result, the Company recorded goodwill in connection with this transaction. This difference includes a going concern element that represents the Company’s ability to earn a higher rate of return on this group of assets than would be expected on the separate assets as determined during the valuation process. Transaction costs of $360,000 were recorded and charged to selling, general and administrative expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income during 2016. F-16 Intangible Assets Identified The following table presents the intangible assets identified in the transaction: Category Estimated fair value (in thousands) Estimated useful life (in years) Customer relationships $ 10,520 11.5 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 15.0 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 10.0 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 16,840 The fair value of the customer relationships asset was determined using the income approach through an excess earnings analysis which estimates value based on the present value of future economic benefits. The customer relationships intangible asset represents relationships between Adesis and its customers. The fair value of the internally-developed IP, processes and recipes was determined by utilizing the relief-from-royalty methodology. The fair value of the Adesis trade name asset was determined using the income approach through a relief-from-royalty analysis. The determination of useful lives was based upon consideration of market participant assumptions and transaction specific factors. Impact on Operating Results The results of Adesis’ operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the July 11, 2016 date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the acquisition of Adesis occurred at the beginning of the respective periods presented (in thousands): 2016 Revenue $ 202,547 Net income 44,718 The unaudited pro forma information presented is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect future events that may occur after December 31, 2018, or any operating efficiencies or inefficiencies that may result from the Adesis acquisition. Additionally, this unaudited pro forma information includes certain one-time costs associated with the Company’s integration of the acquired Adesis operations. Therefore, the information is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been achieved had the business been combined during the periods presented or the results that the Company will experience going forward. 4. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS: The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company classifies its remaining investments as available-for-sale. These debt securities are carried at fair market value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders’ equity. Gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method. Investments as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 consisted of the following (in thousands): Amortized Unrealized Aggregate Fair Investment Classification Cost Gains (Losses) Market Value December 31, 2018 Certificates of deposit $ 500 $ — $ (1 ) $ 499 Corporate bonds 114,678 1 (19 ) 114,660 U.S. Government bonds 317,984 14 (43 ) 317,955 $ 433,162 $ 15 $ (63 ) $ 433,114 December 31, 2017 Certificates of deposit $ 1,296 $ 1 $ (1 ) $ 1,296 Corporate bonds 104,626 — (252 ) 104,374 U.S. Government bonds 214,641 — (139 ) 214,502 $ 320,563 $ 1 $ (392 ) $ 320,172 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was none and $17.9 million of corporate bonds, respectively, and $128.8 million and none of U.S. government securities, respectively, included in cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet. F-17 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS : The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of December 31, 2018 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 139,805 $ 139,805 $ — $ — Short-term investments 304,323 304,323 — — Long-term investments — — — — The following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Fair Value Measurements, Using Total carrying value as of December 31, 2017 Quoted prices in active markets (Level 1) Significant other observable inputs (Level 2) Significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) Cash equivalents $ 27,532 $ 27,532 $ — $ — Short-term investments 287,446 287,446 — — Long-term investments 14,794 14,794 — — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Changes in fair value of the investments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses in other comprehensive income (loss). If a decline in fair value of an investment is deemed to be other than temporary, the cost of the Company’s investment will be written down by the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment with a resulting charge to net income. There were no other-than-temporary impairments of investments as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2017. 6. INVENTORY: Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Raw materials $ 31,203 $ 17,464 Work-in-process 781 2,977 Finished goods 38,016 15,824 Inventory $ 70,000 $ 36,265 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded an inventory write-down of $3.6 million as lower than anticipated customer demand created excess inventory levels in certain products. No inventory write-down was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. F-18 7 . PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT: Property and equipment consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Land $ 1,006 $ 1,006 Building and improvements 39,285 24,101 Office and lab equipment 55,333 33,269 Furniture, fixtures and computer related assets 6,941 4,431 Construction-in-progress 12,117 30,011 114,682 92,818 Less: Accumulated depreciation (44,943 ) (36,368 ) Property and equipment, net $ 69,739 $ 56,450 Depreciation expense was $8.6 million, $4.9 million and $4.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 8. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS: The Company monitors the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Purchased intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of acquired technology and other intangible assets that include trade names, customer relationships and internally developed IP processes. Acquired Technology Acquired technology consists of acquired license rights for patents and know-how obtained from PD-LD, Inc., Motorola, BASF SE (BASF) and Fujifilm. These intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 PD-LD, Inc. $ 1,481 $ 1,481 Motorola 15,909 15,909 BASF 95,989 95,989 Fujifilm 109,462 109,462 222,841 222,841 Less: Accumulated amortization (111,890 ) (91,312 ) Acquired technology, net $ 110,951 $ 131,529 Amortization expense related to acquired technology was $20.6 million, $20.6 million and $15.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the consolidated statements of income and is expected to be $20.5 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2019 through 2021, $15.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2022 and $33.6 million thereafter. Motorola Patent Acquisition In 2000, the Company entered into a royalty-bearing license agreement with Motorola whereby Motorola granted the Company perpetual license rights to what are now 74 issued U.S. patents relating to Motorola’s OLED technologies, together with foreign counterparts in various countries. The last of the issued U.S. patents expired in 2018. On March 9, 2011, the Company purchased these patents from Motorola, including all existing and future claims and causes of action for any infringement of the patents, pursuant to a Patent Purchase Agreement. The Patent Purchase Agreement effectively terminated the Company’s license agreement with Motorola, including any obligation to make royalty payments to Motorola. The technology acquired from Motorola was amortized over a period of 7.5 years. F-19 Fujifilm Patent Acquisition On July 23, 2012, the Company entered into a Patent Sale Agreement with Fujifilm. Under the agreement, Fujifilm sold more than 1,200 OLED-related patents and patent applications in exchange for a cash payment of $105.0 million, plus costs incurred in connection with the purchase. The agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including respective covenants not to sue by both parties thereto. The agreement permitted the Company to assign all of its rights and obligations under the agreement to its affiliates, and the Company assigned, prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the agreement, its rights and obligations to UDC Ireland Limited (UDC Ireland), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company formed under the laws of the Republic of Ireland. The transactions contemplated by the agreement were consummated on July 26, 2012. The Company recorded the $105.0 million plus $4.5 million of purchase costs as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. BASF Patent Acquisition On June 28, 2016, UDC Ireland entered into and consummated an IP Transfer Agreement with BASF. Under the IP Transfer Agreement, BASF sold to UDC Ireland all of its rights, title and interest to certain of its owned and co-owned intellectual property rights relating to the composition of, development, manufacture and use of OLED materials, including OLED lighting and display stack technology, as well as certain tangible assets. The intellectual property includes knowhow and more than 500 issued and pending patents in the area of phosphorescent materials and technologies. These assets were acquired in exchange for a cash payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million). In addition, UDC Ireland also took on certain rights and obligations under three joint research and development agreements to which BASF was a party. The IP Transfer Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the parties. UDC Ireland recorded the payment of €86.8 million ($95.8 million) and acquisition costs incurred of $217,000 as acquired technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 years. Other Intangible Assets As a result of the Adesis acquisition in June 2016, the Company recorded $16.8 million of other intangible assets, including $10.5 million assigned to customer relationships with a weighted average life of 11.5 years, $4.8 million of internally developed IP, processes and recipes with a weighted average life of 15 years, and $1.5 million assigned to trade name and trademarks with a weighted average life of 10 years. At December 31, 2018, these other intangible assets consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2018 Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Customer relationships $ 10,520 $ (2,228 ) $ 8,292 Developed IP, processes and recipes 4,820 (788 ) 4,032 Trade name/Trademarks 1,500 (368 ) 1,132 Total identifiable intangible assets $ 16,840 $ (3,384 ) $ 13,456 Amortization expense related to other intangible assets was $1.4 million, $1.4 million and $615,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense is included in amortization of acquired technology and other intangible assets expense line item on the consolidated statements of income and is expected to be $1.4 million for each of the next five fiscal years (2019 - 2023) and $6.4 million thereafter. Goodwill As a result of the Adesis acquisition, the Company recorded $15.5 million of goodwill. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year unless events suggest an impairment may have been incurred in an interim period. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires the exercise of judgment, including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. As part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, there were no significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of Adesis had occurred. F-20 9. ACCRUED EXPENSES: Accrued expenses consist of the following (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Compensation $ 13,803 $ 20,997 Royalties 6,996 9,746 Research and development agreements 3,572 48 Professional fees 655 748 Consulting 527 491 Other 10,504 2,989 $ 36,057 $ 35,019 10. RESEARCH AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN: The Company funded OLED technology research at Princeton University and, on a subcontractor basis, at the University of Southern California for 10 years under a Research Agreement executed with Princeton University in August 1997 (the 1997 Research Agreement). The principal investigator conducting work under the 1997 Research Agreement transferred to the University of Michigan in January 2006. Following this transfer, the 1997 Research Agreement was allowed to expire on July 31, 2007. As a result of the transfer, the Company entered into a new Sponsored Research Agreement with the University of Southern California to sponsor OLED technology research and, on a subcontractor basis, with the University of Michigan. This new Sponsored Research Agreement (as amended, the 2006 Research Agreement) was effective as of May 1, 2006 and had an original term of three years. On May 1, 2009, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years. The 2006 Research Agreement superseded the 1997 Research Agreement with respect to all work being performed at the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan. Payments under the 2006 Research Agreement were made to the University of Southern California on a quarterly basis as actual expenses were incurred. The Company incurred a total of $5.0 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement, which ended on April 30, 2013. Effective June 1, 2013, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional four years. The Company incurred a total of $4.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement during the extended term. Effective May 1, 2017, the Company amended the 2006 Research Agreement once again to extend the term of the agreement for an additional three years. As of December 31, 2018, in connection with this amendment, the Company was obligated to pay the University of Southern California up to $4.1 million for work to be performed during the remaining extended term, which expires April 30, 2020. From May 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $1.6 million in research and development expense for work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. In connection with entering into the 2006 Research Agreement, the Company amended the 1997 Amended License Agreement to include the University of Michigan as a party to that agreement effective as of January 1, 2006. Under this amendment, Princeton University, the University of Southern California and the University of Michigan have granted the Company a worldwide exclusive license, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed under the 2006 Research Agreement. The financial terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement were not impacted by this amendment. On October 9, 1997, the Company, Princeton University and the University of Southern California entered into an Amended License Agreement (as amended, the 1997 Amended License Agreement) under which Princeton University and the University of Southern California granted the Company worldwide, exclusive license rights, with rights to sublicense, to make, have made, use, lease and/or sell products and to practice processes based on patent applications and issued patents arising out of work performed by Princeton University and the University of Southern California under the 1997 Research Agreement. Under this 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to pay Princeton University royalties for licensed products sold by the Company or its sublicensees. For licensed products sold by the Company, the Company is required to pay Princeton University 3% of the net sales price of these products. For licensed products sold by the Company’s sublicensees, the Company is required to pay Princeton 3% of the revenues received by the Company from these sublicensees. These royalty rates are subject to renegotiation for products not reasonably conceivable as arising out of the 1997 Research Agreement if Princeton University reasonably determines that the royalty rates payable with respect to these products are not fair and competitive. F-21 The Company is obligated, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to pay to Princeton University minimum annual royalties. The minimum royalty payment is $100,000 per yea r. The Company recorded royalty expense in connection with this agreement of $ 7.0 million, $ 9.7 million, and $ 5. 8 million for the years ended December 31, 201 8 , 201 7 , and 201 6 , respectively. The Company also is required, under the 1997 Amended License Agreement, to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring the licensed OLED technology to market. However, this requirement is deemed satisfied if the Company invests a minimum of $800,000 per year in research, development, commercialization or patenting efforts respecting the patent rights licensed to the Company. 11 . EQUITY AND CASH COMPENSATION UNDER THE PPG AGREEMENTS: On September 22, 2011, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated OLED Materials Supply and Service Agreement with PPG (the New OLED Materials Agreement), which replaced the original OLED Materials Agreement with PPG effective as of October 1, 2011. The term of the New OLED Materials Agreement ran through December 31, 2015 and shall be automatically renewed for additional one year terms, unless terminated by the Company by providing prior notice of one year or terminated by PPG by providing prior notice of two years. The agreement was automatically renewed through December 31, 2019. The New OLED Materials Agreement contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the original OLED Materials Agreement. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, PPG continues to assist the Company in developing its proprietary OLED materials and supplying the Company with those materials for evaluation purposes and for resale to its customers. Under the New OLED Materials Agreement, the Company compensates PPG on a cost-plus basis for the services provided during each calendar quarter. The Company is required to pay for some of these services in all cash. Up to 50% of the remaining services are payable, at the Company’s sole discretion, in cash or shares of the Company’s common stock, with the balance payable in cash. The actual number of shares of common stock issuable to PPG is determined based on the average closing price for the Company’s common stock during a specified number of days prior to the end of each calendar half-year period ending on March 31 and September 30. If, however, this average closing price is less than $20.00, the Company is required to compensate PPG in cash. No shares were issued for services to PPG for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company is also required to reimburse PPG for raw materials used for research and development. The Company records the purchases of these raw materials as a current asset until such materials are used for research and development efforts. The Company recorded research and development expense of $771,000, $1.7 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in relation to the cash portion of the reimbursement of expenses and work performed by PPG, excluding amounts paid for commercial chemicals. 12. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY: Preferred Stock The Company’s Articles of Incorporation authorize it to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with designations, rights and preferences determined from time-to-time by the Company’s Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Company’s Board of Directors is empowered, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of shareholders of the Company’s common stock. In 1995, the Company issued 200,000 shares of Series A Nonconvertible Preferred Stock (Series A) to American Biomimetics Corporation (ABC) pursuant to a certain Technology Transfer Agreement between the Company and ABC. The Series A shares have a liquidation value of $7.50 per share. Series A shareholders, as a single class, have the right to elect two members of the Company’s Board of Directors. This right has never been exercised. Holders of the Series A shares are entitled to one vote per share on matters which shareholders are generally entitled to vote. The Series A shareholders are not entitled to any dividends. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had issued 200,000 shares of preferred stock, all of which were outstanding. Common Stock On June 21, 2018, the Company’s shareholders approved an amendment to the Company’s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000. The amendment was filed with the Pennsylvania Department of State, and became effective on July 17, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had issued 48,681,524 shares of common stock, of which 47,319,887 were outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 3,774 shares of common stock, now held as treasury stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $477,000. F-22 Scientific Advisory Board and Employee Awards During the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company granted a total of 2,456 and 5,590 shares, respectively, of fully vested common stock to employees and non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board for services performed in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value of the shares issued to members of the Scientific Advisory Board was $300,000 for both years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. No fully vested common stock was issued to employees during 2018 and the fair value of the shares issued to employees during 2017 was $165,000. In connection with the issuance of these employee grants during 2017, 605 shares, with fair value of $55,000, were withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations. Dividends During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company declared and paid cash dividends of $0.24 per common share, or $11.3 million, on the Company’s outstanding common stock. On February 21, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a first quarter dividend of $0.10 per share of common stock. Payment of the dividend will be made on March 29, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019. 13.

(2) Refer to Note 15: Employee Retirement Plans F-23 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: Equity Compensation Plan In 1995, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a stock option plan, which was most recently amended and restated in 2014 and is now called the Equity Compensation Plan. The Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, shares of common stock, stock appreciation rights and performance units to employees, directors and consultants of the Company. Stock options are exercisable over periods determined by the Compensation Committee, but for no longer than 10 years from the grant date. Through December 31, 2018, the Company’s shareholders have approved increases in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Compensation Plan to 10,500,000, and have extended the term of the plan through 2024. As of December 31, 2018, there were 2,403,523 shares that remained available to be granted under the Equity Compensation Plan. Stock Options The following table summarizes the stock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2018 for all the grants under the Equity Compensation Plan (in thousands, except share and per share data): Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding at January 1, 2018 500 $ 10.04 Granted — — Exercised — — Forfeited/ Expired — — Cancelled — — Outstanding at December 31, 2018 500 10.04 Vested and expected to vest 500 10.04 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 500 $ 10.04 No stock options were granted during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. A summary of stock options outstanding and exercisable by price range at December 31, 2018 is as follows (in thousands, except share and per share data): Outstanding and Exercisable Exercise Price Number of Options Outstanding at December 31, 2018 Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value (A) $ 10.04 500 0.5 $ 10.04 $ 42 (A) The difference between the stock option’s exercise price and the closing price of common stock at December 31, 2018. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was none, $146,000 and $507,000, respectively. There was no compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, no shares of common stock were tendered to net share settle the exercise of options. F-24 Stock Awards The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock unit (“RSU”) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2018 110,683 $ 88.91 Granted 51,968 115.48 Vested (69,670 ) 97.14 Forfeited (600 ) 103.09 Unvested, December 31, 2018 92,381 $ 97.56 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSU awards granted was $115.48, $116.58 and $53.85 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $8.1 million, $8.3 million and $5.4 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted stock award (“RSA”) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2018 579,937 $ 46.72 Granted 2,456 122.15 Vested (172,444 ) 47.75 Unvested, December 31, 2018 409,949 $ 46.74 The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSA awards granted was $122.15, $83.25 and $65.37 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSAs was $17.7 million, $14.8 million and $8.6 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Restricted Stock Awards and Units The Company has issued restricted stock awards and units to employees and non-employees with vesting terms of one to six years. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant for awards granted to employees and equal to the market price at the end of the reporting period for unvested non-employee awards or upon the date of vesting for vested non-employee awards. Expense for restricted stock awards and units is amortized ratably over the vesting period for the awards issued to employees and using a graded vesting method for the awards issued to non-employees. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to restricted stock awards and units issued to employees and non-employees, selling, general and administrative expense of $7.6 million, $8.5 million and $6.6 million, manufacturing expense of $758,000, $443,000 and $1.1 million and research and development expense of $2.0 million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. The majority of the Company’s restricted stock awards and units that vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were net-share settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate tax authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 86,679, 89,661 and 84,135 for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and were based on the value of the restricted vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $9.2 million, $7.8 million and $4.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the consolidated statements of cash flows. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded as compensation charges related to all restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Scientific Advisory Board whose unvested shares are marked to market each reporting period, research and development expense of $64,000, $976,000 and $242,000, respectively. F-25 Board of Directors Compensation The Company has granted restricted stock units to non-employee members of the Board of Directors with vesting terms of approximately one year. The fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The restricted stock units are issued and expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded compensation charges for services performed related to all restricted stock units granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors, selling and administrative expense of $4.3 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Restricted stock issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was 25,000, 27,500 and 30,000 shares, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized cost related to RSUs and RSAs was $19.4 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.84 years. Performance Unit Awards The following table summarizes the activity related to performance unit awards (“PSU”) share based payment awards: Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant-Date Fair Value Unvested, January 1, 2018 73,315 $ 62.36 Granted 40,601 119.62 Vested (61,186 ) 45.19 Unvested, December 31, 2018 52,730 $ 86.43 During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the Company granted 40,601, 24,664 and 25,045 performance units, of which 6,022, 7,817 and 12,520 are subject to performance-based vesting requirements and 6,025, 7,821 and 12,525 are subject to market-based vesting requirements, and will vest over the terms described below. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were also 28,554 and 9,026 incremental performance-based shares that vested resulting from an increased vesting factor based on Company performance. The weighted average grant date fair value of the performance unit awards granted was $119.62, $105.65 and $58.46 during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as determined by the Company’s common stock on date of grant for the units with performance-based vesting and a Monte-Carlo simulation for the units with market-based vesting. Each performance unit award is subject to both a performance-vesting requirement (either performance-based or market-based) and a service-vesting requirement. The performance-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's cumulative revenue growth compared to the cumulative revenue growth of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The market-based vesting requirement is tied to the Company's total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of companies comprising the Nasdaq Electronics Components Index, as measured over a specific performance period. The maximum number of performance units that may vest based on performance is two times the shares granted. Further, if the Company's total shareholder return is negative, the performance units may not vest at all. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded, as compensation charges related to all performance stock units, selling, general and administrative expense of $1.3 million, $1.2 million and $1.3 million, manufacturing expense of $141,000, $119,000 and $133,000 and research and development expenses of $330,000, $276,000 and $356,000, respectively. In connection with the vesting of performance units during the year ended December 31, 2018, 25,208 shares with an aggregate fair value of $2.9 million were withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 19,217 shares with an aggregate fair value of $1.6 million were withheld in satisfaction of employee tax withholding obligations. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to PSUs was $1.4 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.56. Employee Stock Purchase Plan On April 7, 2009, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The ESPP was approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective on June 25, 2009. The Company has reserved 1,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the ESPP. Unless terminated sooner by the Board of Directors, the ESPP will expire when all reserved shares have been issued. F-26 Eligible employees may elect to contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions during consecutive three-month p urchase periods, the first of which began on July 1, 2009. Each employee who elects to participate will be deemed to have been granted an option to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the first day of the purchase period. Unless the employee o pts out during the purchase period, the option will automatically be exercised on the last day of the period, which is the purchase date, based on the employee’s accumulated contributions to the ESPP. The purchase price will equal 85% of the lesser of the closing price per share of common stock on the first day of the period or the last business day of the period. Employees may allocate up to 10% of their base compensation to purchase shares of common stock under the ESPP; however, each employee may purchase no more than 12,500 shares on a given purchase date, and no employee may purchase more than $25,000 of common stock under the ESPP during a given calendar year. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company issued 10,303, 9,730 and 9,386 shares, respectively, of its common stock under the ESPP, resulting in proceeds of $798,000, $734,000 and $439,000, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded charges of $82,000, $69,000 and $45,000, respectively, to selling, general and administrative expense, $81,000, $46,000, $15,000, respectively, to manufacturing expense and $130,000, $94,000 and $67,000, respectively, to research and development expense, related to ESPP equal to the amount of the discount and the value of the look-back feature. 15. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS: Defined Contribution Plan The Company maintains the Universal Display Corporation 401(k) Plan (the Plan) in accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). The Plan covers substantially all full-time employees of the Company. Participants may contribute up to 90% of their total compensation to the Plan, not to exceed the limit as defined in the Code. Since January 1, 2017, once an employee is eligible to participate in the Plan, the Company will make a non-elective contribution equal to 3% of the employee’s total compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company contributed $1.2 million, $601,000 and $459,000, respectively, to the Plan. Defined Benefit Plan On March 18, 2010, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company approved and adopted the Universal Display Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), effective as of April 1, 2010. On March 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors amended the SERP to include salary and bonus as part of the plan. Prior to this amendment, the SERP benefit did not take into account any bonuses. The purpose of the SERP, which is unfunded, is to provide certain of the Company’s key employees with supplemental pension benefits following a cessation of their employment. As of December 31, 2018 there were seven participants in the SERP. The SERP benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and in certain cases, the participant's average annual bonus for the most recent three fiscal years ending prior to the participant's date of termination of employment with the Company for the life of the participant. For this purpose, annual base salary means 12 times the highest monthly base salary paid or payable to the participant during the 24-month period immediately preceding the participant’s date of termination of employment, or, if required, the date of a change in control of the Company. Under the SERP, if a participant resigns or is terminated without cause at or after age 65 and with at least 20 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. The benefit is based on a percentage of the participant’s annual base salary and bonus for the life of the participant. This percentage is 50%, 25% or 15%, depending on the participant’s benefit class. If a participant resigns at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit. If a participant is terminated without cause or on account of a disability after at least 15 years of service, he or she will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit in either case would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. In the event a participant is terminated for cause, his or her SERP benefit and any future benefit payments are subject to immediate forfeiture. The SERP benefit is payable in installments over 10 years, beginning at the later of age 65 or the date of the participant’s separation from service. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancy of the participant. This calculation is made as of the date benefit payments are to begin (later of age 65 or separation from service). If the participant dies after reaching age 65, any future or remaining benefit payments are made to the participant’s beneficiary or estate. If the participant dies before reaching age 65, the benefit is forfeited. F-27 In the event of a change in control of the Company, each participant will become immediately vested in his or her SERP benefit. Unless the participant’s benefit has already fully vested, if the participant has less t han 20 years of service at the time of the change in control, he or she will receive a prorated benefit based on his or her number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. If the change in control qualifies as a “change in control event” for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, then each participant (including former employees who are entitled to SERP benefits) will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to the present value of the benefit immediately upon the change in control. Certain of the Company’s executive officers are designated as special participants under the SERP. If these participants resign or are terminated without cause after 20 years of service, or at or after age 65 and with at least 15 years of service, they will be eligible to receive a SERP benefit. If they are terminated without cause or on account of a disability, they will be eligible to receive a prorated SERP benefit regardless of age. The prorated benefit would be based on the participant’s number of years of service (up to 20), divided by 20. The SERP benefit for special participants is based on 50% of their annual base salary and bonus for their life and the life of their surviving spouse, if any. Payments are based on a present value calculation of the benefit amount for the actuarial remaining life expectancies of the participant and their surviving spouse, if any. If they die before reaching age 65, the benefit is not forfeited if the surviving spouse, if any, lives until the participant would have reached age 65. If their spouse also dies before the participant would have reached age 65, the benefit is forfeited. The Company records amounts relating to the SERP based on calculations that incorporate various actuarial and other assumptions, including discount rates, rate of compensation increases, retirement dates, and life expectancies. The net periodic costs are recognized as employees render the services necessary to earn the SERP benefits. In connection with the initiation and subsequent amendments of the SERP, the Company recorded cost related to prior service of $20.4 million as accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2018. The prior service cost is being amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost over the average of the remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits under the plan. The prior service cost expected to be amortized for the year ending December 31, 2019 is $3.2 million. Information relating to the Company’s plan is as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change in benefit obligation: Benefit obligation, beginning of year $ 33,176 $ 27,563 Service cost 1,301 1,214 Interest cost 1,047 1,013 Actuarial loss 8,531 2,952 Plan amendment — 434 Benefit obligation, end of year 44,055 33,176 Fair value of plan assets — — Unfunded status of the plan, end of year $ 44,055 $ 33,176 Current liability — — Noncurrent liability $ 44,055 $ 33,176 The accumulated benefit obligation for the plan was approximately $41.3 million and $30.4 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The components of net periodic pension cost were as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Service cost $ 1,301 $ 1,214 $ 1,415 Interest cost 1,047 1,013 875 Amortization of prior service cost 1,683 1,667 1,660 Amortization of loss 435 457 15 Total net periodic benefit cost $ 4,466 $ 4,351 $ 3,965 F-28 The measurement date is the Company’s fiscal year end. The net periodic pension cost is based on assumptions determined at the prior year end measurement date. Assumptions used to determine the year end benefit obligation were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Discount rate 3.82 % 3.22 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % Assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension cost were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Discount rate 3.22 % 3.41 % 3.57 % Rate of compensation increases 3.50 % 3.50 % 3.50 % Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over future years based upon the average remaining service period of active plan participants, when the accumulation of such gains or losses exceeds 10% of the year end benefit obligation. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost or credit) is included in the Company’s results of income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active plan participants. The estimated amounts to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into the net periodic pension cost in 2019 are as follows (in thousands): Amortization of prior service cost $ 1,595 Amortization of loss 1,642 Total $ 3,237 Benefit payments, which reflect estimated future service, are currently expected to be paid as follows (in thousands): Year Projected Benefits 2019 $ — 2020 3,551 2021 3,640 2022 4,122 2023 4,427 2024-2028 25,977 Thereafter 23,647 16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: Commitments Under the 2006 Research Agreement with USC, the Company is obligated to make certain payments to USC based on work performed by USC under that agreement, and by Michigan under its subcontractor agreement with USC. See Note 10 for further explanation. Under the terms of the 1997 Amended License Agreement, the Company is required to make minimum royalty payments to Princeton. See Note 10 for further explanation. The Company has agreements with six executive officers and one employee which provide for certain cash and other benefits upon termination of employment of the officer in connection with a change in control of the Company. If the executive’s employment is terminated in connection with the change in control, the executive is entitled to a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of the average annual base salary and bonus of the officer and immediate vesting of all stock options and other equity awards that may be outstanding at the date of the change in control, among other items. F-29 In order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate material supply, the Company entered into a New OLED M aterials Ag reement (see Note 11) that allow s PPG to procure and produce inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company. These purchase commitments consist of firm, noncancelable and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, this agreement a llows the Company the option to reschedule and adjust the Company’s requirements based on its business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 201 8 , 201 7 and 201 6 , the Company had purchase commitments for inventory of $ 15.9 million, $ 14 . 2 million and $ 5 . 0 million, respectively. The Company had lease obligations of $10.9 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 . Patent Related Challenges and Oppositions Each major jurisdiction in the world that issues patents provides both third parties and applicants an opportunity to seek a further review of an issued patent. The process for requesting and considering such reviews is specific to the jurisdiction that issued the patent in question, and generally does not provide for claims of monetary damages or a review of specific claims of infringement. The conclusions made by the reviewing administrative bodies tend to be appealable and generally are limited in scope and applicability to the specific claims and jurisdiction in question. The Company believes that opposition proceedings are frequently commenced in the ordinary course of business by third parties who may believe that one or more claims in a patent do not comply with the technical or legal requirements of the specific jurisdiction in which the patent was issued. The Company views these proceedings as reflective of its goal of obtaining the broadest legally permissible patent coverage permitted in each jurisdiction. Once a proceeding is initiated, as a general matter, the issued patent continues to be presumed valid until the jurisdiction’s applicable administrative body issues a final non-appealable decision. Depending on the jurisdiction, the outcome of these proceedings could include affirmation, denial or modification of some or all of the originally issued claims. The Company believes that as OLED technology becomes more established and its patent portfolio increases in size, so will the number of these proceedings. Below are summaries of certain active proceedings that have been commenced against issued patents that are either exclusively licensed to the Company or which are now assigned to the Company. The Company does not believe that the confirmation, loss or modification of the Company’s rights in any individual claim or set of claims that are the subject of the following legal proceedings would have a material impact on the Company’s materials sales or licensing business or on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, including its consolidated statements of income, as a whole. However, as noted within the descriptions, some of the following proceedings involve issued patents that relate to the Company’s fundamental phosphorescent OLED technologies and the Company intends to vigorously defend against claims that, in the Company’s opinion, seek to restrict or reduce the scope of the originally issued claim, which may require the expenditure of significant amounts of the Company’s resources. In certain circumstances, when permitted, the Company may also utilize the proceedings to request modification of the claims to better distinguish the patented invention from any newly identified prior art and/or improve the claim scope of the patent relative to commercially important categories of the invention. The entries marked with an ""*"" relate to the Company’s UniversalPHOLED® phosphorescent OLED technology, some of which may be commercialized by the Company. Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 On November 16, 2011, Osram AG and BASF SE each filed a Notice of Opposition to European Patent No. 1390962 (the EP '962 patent), which relates to the Company’s white phosphorescent OLED technology. The EP '962 patent, which was issued on February 16, 2011, is a European counterpart patent to U.S. patents 7,009,338 and 7,285,907. They are exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. The EPO combined the oppositions into a single opposition proceeding, and a hearing on this matter was held in December 2015, wherein the EPO Opposition Division revoked the patent claims for alleged insufficiencies under EPC Article 83. The Company believes the EPO's decision relating to the original claims is erroneous, and has appealed the decision. Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, BASF withdrew its opposition to the patent. The patent, as originally granted by the EPO, is deemed valid during the pendency of the appeals process. At this time, based on its current knowledge, the Company believes that the patent being challenged should be declared valid and that all or a significant portion of the Company's claims should be upheld. However, the Company cannot make any assurances of this result. Opposition to European Patent No. 1933395* On February 24 and 27, 2012, Sumitomo, Merck Patent GmbH and BASF SE filed oppositions to the Company's European Patent No. 1933395 (the EP '395 patent). The EP ‘395 patent is a counterpart to the EP ‘637 patent, and, in part, to U.S. Patents 7,001,536; 6,902,830; and 6,830,828, and to JP patents 4358168 and 4357781. This patent is exclusively licensed to the Company by Princeton, and the Company is required to pay all legal costs and fees associated with this proceeding. F-30 At an Oral Hearing on October 14, 2 013, the EPO panel issued a decision that affirmed the basic invention and broad patent coverage in the EP '395 patent, but narrowed the scope of the original claims. On February 26, 2014, the Company appealed the ruling to reinstate a broader set of claims. The patent, as originally granted by the EPO, is deemed to be valid during the pendency of an appeals process. Two of the three opponents also filed their own appeals of the ruling. In January 2015, Sumitomo withdrew its opposition of the '395 patent, and the EPO accepted the withdrawal notice. The appeal proceedings were held in the second quarter of 2016. As a result of the proceedings, the board concluded the oral proceedings and proposed to reinstate a broader set of claims pending the resolution of a remaining question of the applicable law, a question that the board has deferred to the Enlarged Board of Appeals for review. In December 2017, the Enlarged Board of Appeals issued a written opinion in which they have generally followed the Company’s reasoning regarding the question of law. The written opinion should be used as guidance by the EPO opposition panel when the oral proceedings are rescheduled. The originally-granted claims remain in force during the pendency of this process. In addition to the above proceedings and now concluded proceedings which have been referenced in prior filings, from time to time, the Company may have other proceedings that are pending which relate to patents the Company acquired as part of the Fujifilm patent or BASF OLED patent acquisitions or which relate to technologies that are not currently widely utilized in the marketplace. 17.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Company's ability to generate future taxable income to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits. As part of its assessment, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. At this time there is no evidence to release the valuation allowance that relates to the New Jersey research and development credit. On December 27, 2018 the Korean Supreme Court, citing prior cases, held that the applicable law and interpretation of the Korea-US Tax Treaty were clear that only royalties paid with respect to Korean registered patents are Korean source income and subject to Korean withholding tax. Based on this recent decision, the Company has decided to immediately litigate the Korean withholding on the 2018 royalty payments while continuing the US- Korean Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) for the years 2011 through 2017. UDC has engaged a leading Korean law firm to litigate the 2018 withholding and has been advised that there is a more-likely-than-not chance of success. As a result, UDC has recorded a long-term asset of $13.6 million representing the allocation of withholding to non-Korean patents and a tax expense of $1.3 million representing an allocation of withholding to Korean registered patents. With respect to the Korean withholding for the years 2011 through 2017, UDI has decided to continue the MAP which was accepted by the Korean National Tax Service on September 15, 2017. The Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that a favorable settlement will be reached resulting in a reduction of the Korean withholding taxes previously withheld since 2011. A long-term receivable of $36.9 million for estimated refunds due from the Korean government, a long-term payable of $16.2 million for estimated amounts due to the U.S. Federal government based on amendment of prior year U.S. tax returns for the lower withholding amounts, and a reduction of deferred tax assets for foreign tax credits and R&D credits of $20.7 million has been recorded on the December 31, 2018 balance sheet for this matter. On October 30, 2018, the Korean National Tax Service (KNTS) concluded a tax audit with LG Display (LGD) that included the licensing and royalty payments made to UDI during the years 2015 through 2017. KNTS questioned whether UDI was the beneficial owner of these payments and assessed UDI a charge of $13.2 million for withholding and interest for the three-year period. UDI has engaged a leading Korean law firm which believes it is more-likely-than-not that UDI has beneficial ownership of the underlining intellectual property. As a result, a petition has been filed with the Tax Tribunal. Based on this authority, UDI has paid the assessment which is recorded as a long-term asset as of December 31, 2018. The above estimates may change in the future and ultimately upon settlement of these uncertain tax positions. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company has incurred Korean withholding tax of $14.9 million, $17.6 million and $14.4 million, respectively; which is currently being appealed based on the interpretation of the Korean – U. S. tax treaty and recent Korean Supreme Court decisions. F-33 The Company’s 2013 federal income tax return was audited by the Internal Revenue Services with no cha nge; the years 2014 to 2016 are open and subject to examination. The state and foreign tax returns are open for a period of generally three to four years. 19. REVENUE RECOGNITION: Adoption of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” The Company adopted the standard beginning January 1, 2018 using the “modified retrospective” approach, meaning the standard was applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements, with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. Under this transition method, the Company elected to apply ASC Topic 606 only to contracts that were not complete at the initial adoption date. The new standard impacts how the Company recognizes revenue on its commercial license and material supply agreements with customers. Previously, the Company recognized license fees on a straight-line basis or as received from the customer, and royalty revenue one quarter in arrears based on sales information received from its customers typically received after disclosing that quarter’s results. Under the new standard, total contract consideration is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at its estimated per unit fee. Total contract consideration includes fixed amounts designated in contracts with customers as license fees as well as estimates of material fees and royalties to be earned. Adoption of the new standard resulted in an increase in deferred revenue of $21.3 million offset by a reduction of retained earnings of $17.1 million, net of tax of $3.9 million, and unbilled receivables of $0.3 million as of January 1, 2018. The impact of the new standard to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a decrease of $78.9 million from the amount that would have been reported under the prior accounting standard. The following tables summarize the impacts of adopting Topic 606 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. i. Consolidated Balance Sheet (in thousands) Impact of changes in accounting policies December 31, 2018 As reported Adjustment Balances without adoption of Topic 606 ASSETS Other assets (current and non-current) $ 70,892 $ — $ 70,892 Deferred income taxes 24,377 (11,153 ) 13,224 TOTAL ASSETS 933,424 (11,153 ) 922,271 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Deferred revenue (current and non-current) 122,567 (99,885 ) 22,682 Retained earnings 129,552 88,732 218,284 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY 933,424 (11,153 ) 922,271 ii.

The rights and benefits to the Company’s OLED technology are conveyed to the customer through technology license agreements and material supply agreements. The Company believes that the licenses and materials sold under these combined agreements are not distinct from each other for financial reporting purposes and as such, are accounted for as a single performance obligation. Accordingly, total contract consideration, including material, license and royalty fees, is estimated and recognized over the contract term based on material units sold at the estimated per unit fee over the life of the contract. Various estimates are relied upon to recognize revenue. The Company estimates total material units to be purchased by its customers over the contract term based on historical trends, industry estimates and its forecast process. Additionally, management estimates the total sales-based royalties based on the estimated net sales revenue of its customers over the contract term. Management is using the expected value method to estimate the material per unit fee. Contract Balances The following table provides information about assets and liabilities associated with our contracts from customers (in thousands): As of December 31, 2018 Accounts receivable $ 43,129 Short-term unbilled receivables 1,020 Long-term unbilled receivables — Short-term deferred revenue 80,782 Long-term deferred revenue 41,785 Short-term and long-term unbilled receivables are classified as other current assets and other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred revenue balance at December 31, 2018 will be recognized as materials are shipped to customers over the remaining contract periods. The significant customer contracts (individually representing greater than 10% of revenue) expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $13.1 million of backlog associated with committed purchase orders from its customers for phosphorescent emitter material. These orders are anticipated to be fulfilled within the next 90 days. F-35 Significant changes in the unbilled receivables and deferred liabilities balances during the period are as follows (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 Unbilled Receivables Increase (Decrease) Deferred Revenue (Increase) Decrease Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 70 $ (38,883 ) Adoption of revenue standard on January 1, 2018 307 (21,307 ) Adjusted balance on January 1, 2018 377 (60,190 ) Revenue recognized that was previously included in deferred revenue — 64,562 Increases due to cash received — (130,639 ) Cumulative catch-up adjustment arising from changes in estimates of transaction price — 3,700 Unbilled receivables recognized 2,024 — Transferred to receivables from unbilled receivables (1,381 ) — Net change 643 (62,377 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 1,020 $ (122,567 ) 20 . NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share (""ASC 260""), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of income between the holders of common stock and the Company's participating security holders. Under the two-class method, income for the reporting period is allocated between common shareholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed income. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are participating securities and, therefore, are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period excluding unvested restricted stock units and performance units. Net income allocated to the holders of the Company's unvested restricted stock awards is calculated based on the shareholders proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. For purposes of determining diluted net income per common share, basic net income per share is further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance units, and the impact of shares to be issued under the ESPP. The following table is a reconciliation of net income and the shares used in calculating basic and diluted net income per common share for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except share and per share data): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2015 Numerator: Net income $ 58,840 103,885 48,070 Adjustment for Basic EPS: Earnings allocated to unvested shareholders $ (690 ) (1,638 ) (734 ) Adjusted net income $ 58,150 102,247 47,336 Denominator: Weighted average common shares outstanding – Basic 46,849,588 46,725,289 46,408,460 Effect of dilutive shares: Common stock equivalents arising from stock options and ESPP 1,956 2,611 5,398 Restricted stock awards and units and performance units 45,222 77,294 122,122 Weighted average common shares outstanding – Diluted 46,896,766 46,805,194 46,535,980 Net income per common share: Basic $ 1.24 $ 2.19 $ 1.02 Diluted $ 1.24 $ 2.18 $ 1.02 F-36 For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the combined effects of unvested restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards and stock options of 4,414, none and 2,981, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their impact would have been antidilutive. 2 1 . QUARTERLY SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED): The following tables present certain unaudited consolidated quarterly financial information for each of the eight quarters in the two-year period ended December 31, 2018. In the opinion of Company management, this quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the information for the periods presented. The results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or for any future period.

(2) The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a one-time charge of $11.5 million in the fourth quarter. Per share amounts for each quarter have been calculated separately. Accordingly, quarterly amounts may not add to annual amounts. 2 2 . SUBSEQUENT EVENTS: In January 2019, the Company closed on the purchase of an additional property in Ewing, New Jersey, adjacent to its corporate headquarters, as part of its plans to expand operations. The Company is also planning to close on the purchase of additional property by the end of the first quarter of 2019. When the purchases are complete, the new facilities will add approximately 88,000 square feet at a cost of approximately $8.0 million. The new facilities will initially allow for expansion in the areas of research and development and manufacturing logistics. F-37",0001005284,OLED

Busi ness Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. The Company was founded and initially incorporated in Massachusetts in 1968 as General Scanning, Inc. (“General Scanning”). In 1999, General Scanning merged with Lumonics Inc. The post-merger entity, GSI Lumonics Inc., continued under the laws of the Province of New Brunswick, Canada. In 2005, the Company changed its name to GSI Group Inc. Through a series of strategic divestitures and acquisitions, the Company transformed from one that was more focused on the semiconductor industry to one that primarily develops and supplies components and sub-systems to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The Company changed its name to Novanta Inc. in May 2016. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: 1 Recent Developments Acquisition of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. On August 11, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making disposable tube-set-like products, for a total purchase price of €21.8 million ($22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH has expanded the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities in medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment. Business Environment COVID-19 Pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions and incurred additional costs to protect the health and safety of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, testing employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. These costs were not material in 2022. Although COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreaks of infection in various locations within China, local governmental authorities continued to implement lockdown orders in some areas during 2022, significantly slowing economic and business activities. Our manufacturing and distribution operations in China have been impacted by these lockdowns. There continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable. For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, herein. Global Supply Chain Disruptions Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising product quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply have caused significantly elevated customer backlog levels. As of December 31, 2022, our backlog was almost 2 double our average pre-COVID backlog levels because of longer customer order lead times. We anticipate that our customers will gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease over time in the near future. Inflationary Pressures The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well as increases in the costs of labor. Price increases were on average more than double the 2021 price increases for certain key raw materials and components. Similarly, the overall low unemployment rate and the competition for available talents resulted in average annual wage increases more than doubling 2021 average annual wage increases. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.3% as of December 31, 2021 to approximately 5.1% as of December 31, 2022. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the European Union (“EU”), and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia have not been material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. The duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, these longer-term factors are unknown to our business. Acquisitions We continuously evaluate our business mix and financial performance. Since 2013, we have executed a series of acquisitions in line with our strategy. The following table summarizes significant acquisitions since 2013: Company Year of Acquisition Total Purchase Price (in millions) MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. 2022 $ 22.6 ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. 2021 $ 223.9 Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. 2021 $ 118.6 ARGES GmbH 2019 $ 73.2 Zettlex Holdings Limited 2018 $ 32.0 Laser Quantum Limited (24%) (1) 2018 $ 45.1 Laser Quantum Limited (35%) 2017 $ 31.1 W.O.M.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in 6 technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 51% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers' Index on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Customers We have a diverse group of customers that includes companies that are global leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue from an OEM customer in the medical end market which accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue. Our customers include many OEMs who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on several factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. Seasonality While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the lower seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles. Backlog As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our consolidated backlog was approximately $611.6 million and $568.8 million, respectively. Most orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve months. The ability to reschedule orders included in backlog varies depending on the customer and order. Management believes that backlog typically is not a complete indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the ability of customers to reschedule orders based on their updated demand and timing requirements, the potential fluctuations in our supply chain and manufacturing capacity. Therefore, backlog as of any date should not be relied upon as a complete indicator of our revenues for any future period. During 2022, we continued to experience longer than normal lead times for our customer orders, caused by higher customer demand and unprecedented raw materials shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by both the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic and geopolitical factors. Manufacturing Manufacturing functions are performed internally either when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process, or for cost-related reasons, while other portions of the manufacture of our products are outsourced to highly qualified third parties. Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse, New York; Mukilteo, Washington; Přelouč, Czech Republic; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Apex, North Carolina; Marlborough, Connecticut; Rocklin, California; and Suzhou, China. 7 The majority of our products are produced in manufacturing facilities certified under ISO 9001 certification, while most of our products manufactured for the medical market are produced in factories under ISO 13485 certification. The majority of our manufacturing facilities are also ISO 14001 certified. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders, imaging informatics, and medical insufflators, pumps, disposables, and accessories products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Marketing, Sales and Distribution We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We also use distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Competition We encounter aggressive and strong competition in virtually all the markets, applications, and technologies we serve. Due to the wide and diverse range of products and technologies, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small organizations producing a limited number of highly specialized products or services for specialized applications. The competitive climate of many of the end market applications we serve are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and customer demands that require continuing investments by us. Our competitive success requires advances in technology and product performance, improved price-for-performance ratios, demonstrated increased throughput performance for our customers' products, lower total cost of ownership, product quality, depth of our application knowledge and expertise, reputation amongst customers, customer service and technical support, speed to market, geographical presence, and deep customer relationships. We believe that our products offer several competitive advantages for our customers, and the breadth of the technologies we offer gives us deep applications knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs. Raw Materials, Components and Supplies Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we are able to design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products in case of supply chain shortages. For certain raw materials, components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Patents and Intellectual Property We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold several registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole. 8 We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital We believe that our employees are our most important asset. The Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the CHRO regularly update our board of directors on the operation and status of these human capital activities, including, but not limited to, talent management, talent development, and succession planning. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,000 people, of which approximately 44% were in the United States, 46% in Europe, and 10% in Asia. We win with our customers by delivering new technology innovations through our engineering teams of approximately 600 employees. We believe that our employees have a meaningful role in helping us develop our culture. We utilize survey feedback mechanisms to measure employee engagement and organizational health. This enables us to gain insight into our current status and into areas where we can improve. We have conducted surveys of our entire employee population in each of last four years and we compare our employee engagement and organizational health scores against benchmark populations with our survey vendors. Our employee satisfaction score in 2022 was 90% of the benchmark score. This is an improvement of 3 percentage points compared with 2021. Following each survey cycle, we review the results with our teams across the company and develop specific action plans based on the feedback we receive. We execute on our action plans with the goal of improving our overall organizational health and employee engagement. All employees are responsible for upholding the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, suppliers or customers. We provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, data privacy regulations and workplace harassment on an annual basis. Diversity and Inclusion The Novanta Way defines our performance culture and begins with building cohesive teams based on trust, commitment, and accountability. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are an important part of our culture and will be leader led and embedded into our ways of working. Our aim is to reflect diversity in our governance, leadership, influence, and technical expertise at all levels in the organization. Our policy is to not tolerate discrimination and harassment. We expect our teams to respect our core values and conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. As of December 31, 2022, our board of directors was 50% comprised of men and 50% comprised of women. Women representation on our board of directors increased 17 percentage points in 2022 from 2021. Individuals from underrepresented groups (defined as individuals who self-identify as Black, African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races or ethnicities) remained at 11% representation of our board of directors as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our gender diversification efforts resulted in 40% of our workforce being women, which was an increase of 4 percentage points in women representation on our workforce from December 31, 2021. The proportion of women in management positions amounted to 25%, which is consistent with the prior year. Employees from underrepresented groups represented 45% of our U.S. based workforce as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 3 percentage points compared to 2021. During 2022, our DEI roadmap included a series of strategic initiatives designed to help further diversify our workforce, by connecting with women and underrepresented candidate populations and measuring our recruiting activities to ensure that women and underrepresented candidates are present in our final interview slates by more than 55%, while fostering an inclusive culture and promoting lifelong learning as a part of our work towards cultural transformation. As a result of these initiatives, we increased our representation of women within the Company. We also increased the proportion of employees from underrepresented groups across our U.S. workforce, both among individual employees and in leadership positions. Our Culture Council launched one more Employee Resource Group (""ERG"") with the goal of increasing employees’ sense of inclusion and belonging. We now have three employee-led ERGs: 9 Additionally, our Localization and Development team collaborated with our business units on NovantaCARES, our voluntary community outreach program to promote greater equity within marginalized and underserved communities and to protect the environment. Our Learning and Development team facilitated live peer-to-peer DEI educational programs to promote greater understanding of the benefits of diversity and inclusion. Compensation and Benefits We strive to provide market competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs, which vary by country, can include annual bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation awards, defined contribution retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, health savings account with company matching contributions, paid time off, paid family leave, and tuition assistance. Certain U.S. facilities have a dedicated medical professional on site to provide basic healthcare services to employees, provide general first aid, assess employee health risks and promote employee health. Additionally, all U.S. employees and their families have access to video and telephonic Telemedicine support seven days a week, twenty-four hours a day. Our bonus and commission payment programs allow for higher payouts when goals are exceeded and lower payouts when goals are not achieved as planned. Growth and Development We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Novanta an employer of choice. In certain countries, we offer college tuition reimbursement for eligible employees for undergraduate and graduate studies. In 2019, we founded Novanta University as a primary instrument of company-wide learning management that includes both internal and external training courses. We leverage the Novanta University processes and learning content to ensure all new employees have a common and complete onboarding experience. Our people leaders, with the support of our human resources organization, are accountable for ensuring the onboarding process is complete and effective. In addition to Novanta University, we utilize our Novanta Growth System, which provides processes, tools, and trainings with a focus on continuous improvement. In 2022, further investment was made in leadership development and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Approximately 90% of our top leaders successfully completed our global coaching and leadership development program which included the completion of Individual Development Plans (""IDPs""). Additionally, we launched Leadership Development for Front-Line Leaders, a leadership development program targeting front-line and mid-level leaders. We also hosted numerous DEI educational events throughout the year. This included providing Unconscious Bias voluntary training to over 80% of our professional employees, Inclusive Leadership Masterclasses for our people leaders, and Culture Mapping training for all of our employees around the globe. NovantaCARES - Voluntary Community Support We provide every employee with one paid day-off per year to volunteer at non-profit organizations supporting social charities or the environment. We had set a Novanta-wide goal of sponsoring 250 community service days by the end of 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we surpassed the goal with 314 community service days. Safety and Wellbeing of Our Employees We provide mandatory safety trainings in our facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. In further support of our employees, we maintained and promoted our global health and wellness resource center, “NovantaWELL”. The resource center provides a central information hub for all employees, with country-specific information, on physical and mental health and wellness. Cybersecurity In the normal course of business, we may collect and store confidential and other sensitive information, including proprietary and confidential business information, trade secrets, intellectual property, sensitive third-party information, and employee information. To protect this information, we have developed and implemented continuous monitoring and detection programs, multi-layer defense architecture, encryption of critical data, and comprehensive security assessments protocols. Our cybersecurity program enables us to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks (threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts) with customized measures and controls to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our data and systems. We have established policies and procedures leveraging widely accepted industry standard cyber security frameworks like National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to safeguard against cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we perform penetration testing and engage third parties to assess the effectiveness of our security 10 program. Additionally, we perform organization-wide cybersecurity awareness training multiple times a year and have established a multi-layer recovery plan of our information technology ecosystem to protect against business interruption. Our dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals utilize a variety of cyber protection tools and methods to monitor and enforce our cybersecurity controls and procedures. We also monitor current developments in the cybersecurity industry and adopt new tools and technologies deemed suitable to our environment in order to continuously enhance our cybersecurity profile. However, despite all of our efforts to strengthen our cybersecurity program, there is no guarantee that a significant cyber-attack will not occur in the future. We maintain cybersecurity insurance coverage related to cyber-attacks and other information security breaches; however, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cybersecurity risks. The Company’s Audit Committee and Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee of the Board of Directors are jointly responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee reviews quarterly with management the Company’s cybersecurity program and related matters. We have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past; however, to date, these incidents have not represented a material breach, nor have they had a material impact on our operations or financial results. Future cybersecurity incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, or operating results. Expenses incurred in connection with information security incidents have been immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Government Regulation Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government rules and regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies, and we monitor those changes closely. Environmental Regulations Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)). Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions that have been enacted or adopted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Medical Device Regulations Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities as well as notified bodies. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General 11 Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements. 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is prepared by the manufacturer in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Post-market Regulations After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 12 Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union and U.K. The EU has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“EU Medical Devices Directive”) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (“EU Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted and renewed under the EU Medical Devices Directive. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, several transitional provisions are in place (Article 120) to avoid market disruption and allow a smooth transition from the EU Medical Devices Directive to the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Some device certificates issued under the EU Medical Devices Directive (“MDD certificates”) may remain valid until May 26, 2024, and some devices with MDD certificates may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and no significant change must be made to the device in question. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. During the transition phase, products certified under the EU Medical Devices Directive and products certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation will 13 coexist on the market. Both will have equal status under the law, and no discrimination on eligibility criteria in public tenders may take place. EU Medical Devices Directive Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements in the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement. To demonstrate compliance with the requirements in the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturer’s quality system under the relevant harmonized standards, such as ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems. If satisfied that a relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, a notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s). EU Medical Devices Regulation The recently effective EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement it into national law. The new EU Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market, reinforces surveillance once they are available and, establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market. The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid and no substantial change must be made to the device as such a modification would trigger the obligation to obtain a new certification under the EU Medical Devices Regulation and therefore to have a notified body conducting a new conformity assessment of the devices. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, including the obligations described below. The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Each device 14 – and as applicable, each package – will have a UDI composed of two parts: a device identifier (“UDI-DI”), specific to a device, and a production identifier (“UDI-PI”) to identify the unit producing the device. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators. All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) required to be taken by manufacturers must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs, which are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. A serious incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device on the market (e.g., inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer, undesirable side-effect), which, directly or indirectly, might lead to either the death or serious deterioration of the health of a patient, user, or other persons, or to a serious public health threat. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports. The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs. In the EU, regulatory authorities have the power to carry out announced and, if necessary, unannounced inspections of companies, as well as suppliers and/or sub-contractors and, where necessary, the facilities of professional users. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to the regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. Regulatory authorities have broad compliance and enforcement powers and if such issues cannot be resolved to their satisfaction can take a variety of actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, consent decrees, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. United Kingdom Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has been the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for the medical device market in Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland). The regulations on medical devices in Great Britain continue to be based largely on the two EU Directives (the EU Medical Devices Directive and Directive 90/385/EEC, or “EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive”) which preceded the EU Medical Devices Regulation, as implemented into national law by the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (“SI 2002 No 618”, as amended). However, under the terms of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, the EU Medical Devices Regulation applies to Northern Ireland. On June 26, 2022, the MHRA published its response to a 10-week consultation on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. The MHRA seeks to amend the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, in particular to create a new 15 access pathway to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in-vitro diagnostic medical device regulation and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. Regulations implementing the new regime were originally scheduled to come into force in July 2023, but the Government has recently confirmed that this date is likely to be postponed until July 2024. Devices which have valid CE certification issued by EU notified bodies under the EU Medical Devices Regulation or EU Medical Devices Directive are subject to transitional arrangements. In its consultation response, the MHRA indicated that the future UK regulations will allow devices certified under the EU Medical Devices Regulation to be placed on the market in Great Britain under the CE mark until either the certificate expires or for five years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Devices certified under the EU Medical Devices Directive could continue to be placed on the market until either the certificate expires or for three years after the new regulations take effect, whichever is sooner. Following these transitional periods, it is expected that all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessment (“UKCA”) mark. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis prior to the regulations coming into force. However, from July 2024, products which do not have existing and valid certification under the EU Medical Devices Directive or EU Medical Devices Regulation and are therefore not subject to the transitional arrangements will be required to carry the UKCA mark if they are to be sold into the market in Great Britain. UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K., differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and continues to be based on EU law. For further information regarding EU and U.K. healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business— We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products.” Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, pricing reporting, and physician payment transparency laws and regulations regarding drug pricing and payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and other licensed healthcare professionals as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the United States. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, including HIPAA, could apply to our operations or the operations of our customers. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing.

Ri sk Factors The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. Risks Relating to Our Business Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of our customers’ capital expenditures or business activities. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020. In addition, certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment sector, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have also faced increases in inflationary conditions in materials and components, and we expect these inflationary conditions to continue in 2023. These inflationary conditions have caused us to increase prices; however, such price increases may not be accepted by our customers or may not adequately offset the increases in our costs, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary conditions, could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Our business and operations, and the operations of our suppliers and customers, have been, and may in the future be adversely affected by epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We may face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic and governments’ measures taken in response have had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our business and on the broader economy. We have, at times, experienced weakened demand from certain customers, which has adversely affected our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have, at times, deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. We also faced difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to suppliers’ capacity constraints and shipping and transportation disruptions, the effect of which, coupled with other supply chain challenges, may continue to affect our operations in the foreseeable future. These disruptions have adversely affected our ability to manufacture our products and meet our customers’ schedules. If we are not able to mitigate these disruptions effectively, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules would continue to be adversely affected, possibly materially, and our business could be harmed. In addition, efforts to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components may increase our costs or lower the quality of our product, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. There can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products and to develop new products and technologies will not be disrupted in the future in case of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases, including a resurgence of the COVID-19 or similar pandemics. 17 Our business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility into future business declines. During a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand has prompted customers to look for alternative sources of supply and has left our customers without a supply, both of which have harmed our reputation and made it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers. If this inability to increase production continues or worsens, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In periods of weaker demand, we have been, and may in the future be, required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times also create a risk that we may purchase inventories or manufacture products that we are unable to sell. The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate, to introduce new products in a timely manner, and to manage transitions to new product innovations effectively. Technology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers’ requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Our research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may also introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may not manage the transition from older products effectively to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. New products may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, may have higher costs than initially estimated, may contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems. There have been, and may continue to be, difficulties in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful as we cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. Failure to develop and introduce new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could impede our revenue growth, lead to loss of market share, and negatively affect our results of operations and our competitiveness in the market. Customer order timing and other factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Changes in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include: We received in the past, and may receive in the future, several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers’ businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods. Delays in shipments near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period. 18 In addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. As a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Cyberattacks or other incidents could cause significant disruption in, or breach the security of, our or our third-party providers’ information technology systems, and our business may be adversely affected as a result. We rely on information technology systems, software and services (collectively, “IT Systems”) for internal and external operations. We operate some of these IT Systems ourselves and also rely on IT Systems provided by third parties to run our business, including to interact with our employees and our customers and suppliers. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. We do not control our third-party service providers and we do not maintain redundant systems for some of such services, increasing our vulnerability to problems with such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our third-party service providers collect, process and maintain confidential business information as well as personal information. Like other global companies, there are constant cyber related threats and risks to our IT Systems and data, including by internal and external perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software (for example, ransomware) and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions, as well as power outages, catastrophes, hardware and software bugs, misconfigurations or failures, and other unforeseen events. We have in the past experienced cyberattacks and other security incidents and expect to experience such attacks and incidents in the future. We expect the frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks to continue to accelerate as attackers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, for example, by using techniques designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, such that we may be unable to timely or effectively detect, identify, investigate or remediate attacks in the future. In addition, continued remote and hybrid working arrangements following the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of cybersecurity incidents given the prevalence of phishing and vulnerabilities inherent in non-corporate and home computing environments. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in IT Systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our IT Systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential business or personal information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, suppliers or other business partners, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, or other liabilities that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our IT Systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our insurance policies may not cover all types of cybersecurity risks and liabilities, and even if coverages exist, they may not be sufficient to cover all costs or losses that we may incur. Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements may adversely impact our business and financial results. Laws and regulations in various countries around the world with regards to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. These laws include evolving legislation with respect to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data and the notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. Failure to comply with these laws may affect our reputation and operating results negatively, subject us to significant liability, cost or expense, and may require significant management time and attention. In some cases, these legal requirements may be either unclear in their interpretation and application or they may have inconsistent or conflicting requirements with each other. In addition, some of the privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S., the EU, China and other countries place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business or across country borders, and could impact our business and operations. Compliance with these laws, many of which entail substantial penalties for non-compliance, or future regulations could impose even greater compliance burdens and risks on us. 19 The EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), and the data protection and security laws of other countries impose additional requirements with respect to disclosure and deletion of personal information of their residents, imposing penalties for violations and, in some cases, private right of action for data breaches. These laws, and similar legislation in other U.S. states that is developing or has been recently enacted, impose transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights for certain types of data breaches. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our data compliance efforts that may be time-intensive and costly. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance and experience litigation, reputational harm and business interruption if we fail to protect the privacy of third-party data or to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and other applicable data privacy and protection regimes. Changes in foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds, Chinese Yuan and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds, Chinese Yuan or Japanese Yen, we typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. Additionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposures, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency rate fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks. Our reliance on international operations subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 57% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including: We also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents 20 that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct, which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws. Increased component outsourcing to manufacturers located in different countries than Novanta’s manufacturing facilities leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business. In some cases, we have outsourced the manufacturing of key components and subassemblies to suppliers based in countries outside of the country in which our manufacturing facility resides. We make the decision to outsource these products when we identify suppliers with stronger competencies, resources, capabilities, and lower cost structures than we believe we can develop on our own. However, the outsourcing of these products to such third parties could increase our exposure to geopolitical, economic, trade, and climate related risks, which could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property. Increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our sales channels and supply chain in the international marketplace make us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we sell, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and some other countries, have escalated in recent years. For example, U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports in recent years were followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are or were subject to these tariffs, which have increased our manufacturing costs and have made our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been and may in the future be subject to retaliatory tariffs in China, which may increase our costs and make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. If heightened tariffs or trade restrictions were to be imposed in the future, we may not be able to mitigate their impacts, and our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain other foreign markets could also become subject to retaliatory tariffs, making our products uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The continuing impact of “Brexit” may have a negative effect on our business Following a national referendum and subsequent legislation, the U.K. formally withdrew from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. Among other things, the agreement, which became effective in 2021, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and governance. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects that requires complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the EU, significant uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before Brexit. Brexit has led to legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom continues to determine which EU laws to replace or replicate, including financial laws and regulations, tax and free trade agreements, customs laws, intellectual property rights, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, employment laws, and transport laws, which could increase the difficulty and cost of compliance. We cannot yet predict the full implications of Brexit, including whether it will increase our operational costs or otherwise have a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Others may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights. Our future success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any applications filed by us, or that the claims allowed, even if patents are issued, will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and 21 time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors. Our operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties. We have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. We could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement. We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences. Some of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. We expect that our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses as planned. As part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O., ATI Industrial Automation, Inc., Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc., ARGES GmbH, Med X Change, Inc., and Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management’s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. Further, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate newly acquired operations into our existing businesses. We may fail to identify inherent weaknesses in acquired businesses or misinterpret market and technology trends and growth potentials during our acquisition due diligence process. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investments, our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. If we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified 22 personnel. We have recently experienced increased turnover of key personnel, and the competition for skilled employees is intense. We have incurred increased expenses in connection with the retention of existing key personnel and hiring of new employees, and we expect these increased costs to continue. Additional losses of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. The costs to retain or hire employees could also increase more than we expect. Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses and improve gross margin is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize the expected cost savings and gross margin improvements. We are taking, and may need to take in the future, additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. Product defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors’ products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation. We produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors’ products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, have adversely affected the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or a single source of supply. Certain single source suppliers of key components for us could decide or have decided to stop producing some of these components. If we fail to find alternative sources, redesign our products or otherwise manage this transition effectively, our business would be adversely impacted. If we experience delays in receiving materials from certain of our key limited or single source suppliers, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our business could be adversely affected. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders. In addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders. 23 If we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on multiple factors, including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt production and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers. Production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. We experienced factory disruptions at certain of our U.K. and China facilities during 2022. If our production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were again disrupted, including by mandatory power consumption reductions, natural disasters or other weather events, health epidemics, acts of terrorism or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could also be the result of: From time to time, we make decisions to consolidate or move certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility, including the ongoing move of our air bearing spindles manufacturing from one of our U.K. sites to our facility in China. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping and customs delays, travel and technology restrictions, tax issues, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the key package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers. We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products. Some of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, medical devices must comply with the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. All medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the general safety and performance requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Regulation including the requirement that a medical 24 device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, during normal conditions of use, it is suitable for its intended purpose. Medical devices must be safe and effective and must not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and – where applicable – other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with their use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety, taking into account the generally acknowledged state of the art. To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. The notified body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant general safety and performance requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we would be unable to affix the CE mark to our products, which would prevent us from selling them within the EU. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA. Non-compliance with the above requirements would also prevent us from selling our products in these countries. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. The process of obtaining marketing approval, certification or clearance from the FDA, comparable agencies, or notified bodies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could: In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved or certified in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals or certification for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval or certification will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. In the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Several notified bodies have been designated under the EU Medical Devices Regulation. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly slowed down their designation process, the current designated notified bodies are facing a large amount of requests for (re)certification under the new regulations as a consequence, review times may have lengthened. This situation may impact the way we are conducting our business in the EU and the EEA and the ability of our notified body to timely review and process our regulatory submissions and perform its audits. The FDA, other worldwide regulatory agencies, and notified bodies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review, inspection and audit of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA and other regulatory agencies worldwide can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Similar requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances, approvals or certifications, and could result in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 25 Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future changes. For instance, the landscape concerning medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On May 26, 2021, the EU Medical Devices Regulation became applicable, and repealed and replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive and the EU Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states. The EU Medical Devices Regulation is intended to establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and EEA. There are currently different regulations in place in Great Britain as compared to both Northern Ireland and the EU. Ongoing compliance with both sets of regulatory requirements may result in increased costs for our business. Furthermore, the U.K. government is currently drafting amendments to the existing legislation which is likely to result in further changes to the Great Britain regulations in the near future. For example, subject to transitional periods for validly-certified devices, the new Great Britain regulations are likely to require medical devices placed on the Great Britain market to be “UKCA” certified by a UK Approved Body in order to be lawfully placed on the market. The U.K. government has stated that the amended regulations are likely to apply starting in July 2024. Understanding and ensuring compliance with any new requirements is likely to lead to further complexity and increased costs to our business. If there is insufficient UK Approved Body capacity, there is a risk that our product certification could be delayed which might impact our ability to market products in Great Britain after the respective transition periods. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. For example, on February 23, 2022, the FDA issued a proposed rule to amend the Quality System Regulation, which establishes current good manufacturing practice requirements for medical device manufacturers, to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization standards. This proposal has not yet been finalized or adopted. Accordingly, it is unclear the extent to which this or any other proposals, if adopted, could impose additional or different regulatory requirements on us that could increase the costs of compliance or negatively affect our business. Any new statutes, regulations, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs, lengthen regulatory review time for, or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of our products. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval, changes to manufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products, or require additional record keeping. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, approvals or certification, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance or certification on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances or certifications, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval or certification by the FDA or other comparable agencies (or notified bodies where applicable) in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and operations are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties. Our products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign and U.S. federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sale, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include: 26 Efforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products. Several of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurs, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting both in the U.S. and internationally could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. Various elements of healthcare reforms, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may have material adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in 27 products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on centralized information systems to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We often need to upgrade our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new or upgrading existing enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become proficient in the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of new or upgraded ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2022, we had $654.7 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets. Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reliance upon OEM customers subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control. Our sales depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") policies and practices may cause us to incur additional costs or expose us to additional risks. There has been increased public focus and scrutiny from investors, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and customers on corporate ESG practices in recent years, including with respect to global warming and climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor and human rights, among other ESG issues. Both the standard setting and regulatory landscapes are extremely complex and present significant compliance challenges. Many different organizations are promulgating reporting standards and rules that focus on a myriad of ESG topics. In March 2022, the SEC published its proposed rule, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” which sets forth certain prescriptive rules that, if adopted as proposed, will significantly increase our reporting obligations and cost of compliance. In November 2022, the European Commission approved the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”), which will affect both European businesses and their parent companies, including non-EU entities that exceed certain thresholds or meet other requirements. As we continue to focus on developing our ESG practices, such 28 practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our large, global customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to support customers in achieving these reductions, we may lose revenue if our customers find other suppliers who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all key stakeholders could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the market price of our common shares. Further, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment or voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings could lead to negative investor sentiment toward us and/or our industry, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital. In addition, concerns over climate change and sustainability have led to foreign and domestic legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. We may experience increased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and comply with future climate-change related government mandates as well as stricter environmental protection laws, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability. Risks Relating to Taxes Novanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation. Novanta Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S. sourced passive income items, such as dividends, royalties and certain types of interest. Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure We may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, the need to invest in cloud-based enterprise resource planning systems and other digital technology platforms to help accelerate the growth of our businesses, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding debt of $440.3 million under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and $336.6 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financing to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares. Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, we had $440.3 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: 29 Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder. General Risk Factors The market price for our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by: In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions with varying tax rates, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, and/or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers’ failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition. If we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business. While our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal 30 control or those of any business we acquire. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common shares. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. Item 1B.

Market for Registrant’s Common Shares, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information The Company’s common shares, no par value, are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “NOVT”. Holders As of the close of business on February 21, 2023, there were approximately 32 holders of record of the Company’s common shares. Since many of the common shares are registered in “nominee” or “street” names, the Company believes that the total number of beneficial owners is considerably higher. Dividend Policy The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchaser In October 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the ""2018 Repurchase Plan""), authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of the Company's common shares. The Company completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan in the second quarter of 2022 and repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $9.5 million at an average price of $118.97 per share in 2022 prior to the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan. The Company repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares at an average price of $94.57 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, the Company's Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the ""2020 Repurchase Plan""), authorizing the repurchase of $50.0 million worth of the Company's common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million at an average price of $116.95 per share under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. No shares were repurchased during the three months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $49.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. 33 Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on the Company’s common shares with the cumulative total return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index for the period from December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our financial results and our financial condition; our belief that the Purchasing Managers Index may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market; our strategy; anticipated financial performance; expected liquidity and capitalization; drivers of revenue growth and our growth expectations in various markets; management’s plans and objectives for future operations, expenditures and product development, and investments in research and development; business prospects; potential of future product releases and expansion of our product and service offerings; anticipated revenue performance; industry trends; market conditions; our competitive positions; changes in economic and political conditions, including supply chain disruptions and constraints and inflationary pressures; changes in accounting principles; changes in actual or assumed tax liabilities; expectations regarding tax exposures; anticipated reinvestment of future earnings and dividend policy; anticipated expenditures in regard to the Company’s benefit plans; future acquisitions and integration and anticipated benefits from acquisitions and dispositions; anticipated economic benefits and expected costs of restructuring programs; ability to repay our indebtedness; our intentions regarding the use of cash; expectations regarding legal and regulatory requirements, including environmental requirements, and our compliance thereto; and other statements that are not historical facts. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” “estimates,” “plans,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “potential,” “continues,” and similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) identify forward looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Management and the Company disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in its expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward looking statements, except as required under applicable law. Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2022, the medical market accounted for approximately 49% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2022, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 51% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 36 Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: Significant Events and Updates Acquisition of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. On August 11, 2022, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic- based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making disposable tube-set-like products, for a total purchase price of €21.8 million ($22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH has expanded the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities in medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment. Business Environment COVID-19 Pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions and incurred additional costs to protect the health and safety of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, testing employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. These costs were not material in 2022. Although COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed in the U.S. and Europe, in response to outbreaks of infection in various locations within China, local governmental authorities continued to implement lockdown orders in some areas during 2022, significantly slowing economic and business activities. Our manufacturing and distribution operations in China have been impacted by these lockdowns. There continue to be isolated COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions of the world, but these outbreaks have not had a significant impact on our operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and beyond remains uncertain and unpredictable. For further discussion on the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors . 37 Global Supply Chain Disruptions Over the past three years, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers could further challenge our ability to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of supply chain interruptions, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used without compromising quality and performance, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays for obtaining raw materials from suppliers. Our supply chain disruptions and customer orders to secure supply have caused significantly elevated customer order backlog levels. As of December 31, 2022, our backlog was almost double our average pre-COVID backlog levels due to longer customer lead times. We anticipate that our customers will gradually shorten their order lead times as supply chain disruptions ease over time in the near future. Inflationary Pressures The COVID-19 pandemic and the global supply chain disruptions have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for raw materials and components as well increases in the costs of labor. Price increases were on average more than double the 2021 price increases for certain key raw materials and components. Similarly, the overall low unemployment rate and the competition for available talents resulted in average annual wage increases more than doubling 2021 average annual wage increases. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity cost reduction initiatives, as well as increasing our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers. However, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Additionally, the inflationary pressures have given rise to significant increases in interest rates as various governments used monetary policy to reduce inflation. As a result, our weighted average interest rate increased from approximately 2.3% as of December 31 2021 to approximately 5.1% as of December 31, 2022. Russia Ukraine Conflict In February 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. In response, the U.S., the EU, and several other countries imposed economic and trade sanctions and other restrictions (collectively, “global sanctions”) targeting Russia and Belarus. Russia then imposed retaliatory economic measures against the U.S., the EU, and several other countries. Our sales to Russia have not been material. We also do not have any assets, employees or third-party contractors in Russia or Ukraine. The duration of the conflict and further sanctions could have further impact on the global economy and inflation. Due to the uncertainty around the duration of the conflict, these longer-term factors are unknown to our business. Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for 2022 was $860.9 million, an increase of $154.1 million, or 21.8%, versus 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue from acquisitions in 2021 and 2022 and increased demand in the advanced industrial and medical markets. The effect of our acquisitions resulted in an increase in revenue of $93.3 million, or 13.2%. In addition, foreign exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $36.9 million, or 5.2%, in 2021. Operating income for 2022 was $103.1 million, an increase of $39.0 million, or 60.9%, versus 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $78.1 million primarily attributable to higher revenue and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related charges of $13.6 million, partially offset by an increase in research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses of $13.2 million, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $29.7 million and amortization expense of $9.8 million. Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $2.08 in 2022 increased $0.66 from the basic EPS of $1.42 in 2021. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $2.06 in 2022 increased $0.65 from the diluted EPS of $1.41 in 2021. The increases in basic EPS and diluted EPS were primarily attributable to the increase in operating income offset by the increase of income tax provision. Specific components of our operating results for 2022 and 2021 are further discussed below. 38 Results of Operations Information pertaining to fiscal year 2020 results of operations, including a year-over-year comparison with fiscal year 2021, was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2022. The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Photonics $ 274,674 $ 232,459 18.2 % Vision 277,992 262,060 6.1 % Precision Motion 308,237 212,274 45.2 % Total $ 860,903 $ 706,793 21.8 % Photonics Photonics segment revenue in 2022 increased by $42.2 million, or 18.2%, versus 2021, primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial and medical markets. Vision Vision segment revenue in 2022 increased by $15.9 million, or 6.1%%, versus 2021, primarily due to increased demand for minimally invasive surgery products, partially offset by production delays as a result of shortages of raw materials and other supply chain disruptions. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue in 2022 increased by $96.0 million, or 45.2%, versus 2021, primarily due to $88.0 million of revenue contributions from 2021 acquisitions and increased demand in advanced industrial and medical markets, partially offset by a decline in microelectronics market. Gross Profit The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): 2022 2021 Gross profit: Photonics $ 129,173 $ 107,993 Vision 108,713 100,890 Precision Motion 146,150 99,345 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (5,564 ) (7,900 ) Total $ 378,472 $ 300,328 Gross profit margin: Photonics 47.0 % 46.5 % Vision 39.1 % 38.5 % Precision Motion 47.4 % 46.8 % Total 44.0 % 42.5 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for 2022 increased $21.2 million, or 19.6%, versus 2021, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 47.0% for 2022, versus a gross profit margin of 46.5% for 2021. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory productivity and utilization, partially offset by supply chain disruptions and overall cost inflation. 39 Vision Vision segment gross profit for 2022 increased $7.8 million, or 7.8%, versus 2021, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Vision segment gross profit margin was 39.1% for 2022, compared with a gross profit margin of 38.5% for 2021. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory efficiency. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for 2022 increased $46.8 million, or 47.1%, versus 2021, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 47.4% for 2022, compared with a gross profit margin of 46.8% for 2021. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to improved factory utilization, partially offset by supply chain disruption and overall cost inflation. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2022 2021 2022 vs. 2021 Research and development and engineering $ 85,770 $ 72,522 18.3 % Selling, general and administrative 158,901 129,155 23.0 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 26,338 16,577 58.9 % Restructuring and acquisition related costs 4,384 18,020 (75.7 )% Total $ 275,393 $ 236,274 16.6 % Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $85.8 million, or 10.0% of revenue, in 2022, versus $72.5 million, or 10.3% of revenue, in 2021. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to higher compensation related expense and R&D expenses from businesses acquired in 2021. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management. SG&A expenses were $158.9 million, or 18.5% of revenue, in 2022, versus $129.2 million, or 18.3% of revenue, in 2021. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to SG&A expenses from businesses acquired in 2021 and increases in variable compensation and discretionary spending. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of developed technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, trade names, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $26.3 million, or 3.1% of revenue, in 2022, versus $16.6 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2021. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of more acquired intangible assets from the 2021 acquisitions. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs Restructuring, acquisition, and related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. 40 We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $4.4 million in 2022, versus $18.0 million in 2021. The decrease in acquisition and related costs versus the prior year was primarily due to a $3.3 million reduction in earnout expenses related to prior year acquisitions, a $1.9 million reduction in legal fees and a $4.4 million reduction in other acquisition and related expenses. The restructuring costs also decreased $3.9 million related to decreased expenses for our restructuring plans. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2022 and 2021 (in thousands): 2022 2021 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 63,760 $ 46,792 Vision 28,244 17,694 Precision Motion 60,294 52,676 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (49,219 ) (53,108 ) Total $ 103,079 $ 64,054 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $63.8 million, or 23.2% of revenue, in 2022, versus $46.8 million, or 20.1% of revenue, in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $21.2 million, and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related costs of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D spending of $2.9 million and an increase in SG&A expenses of $2.8 million. Vision Vision segment operating income was $28.2 million, or 10.2% of revenue, in 2022, versus $17.7 million, or 6.8% of revenue, in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $7.8 million, a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related costs of $3.1 million, and a decrease in amortization expenses of $1.6 million, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses of $1.9 million. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $60.3 million, or 19.6% of revenue, in 2022, versus $52.7 million, or 24.8% of revenue, in 2021. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $46.8 million, and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D spending of $10.3 million, an increase in SG&A expenses of $21.9 million and an increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $11.2 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared SG&A functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2022 decreased by $3.9 million, or 7.3%, from 2021, primarily due to a decrease in costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $3.3 million, and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition and related costs of $4.7 million, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses of $3.1 million. Interest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2022 and 2021(in thousands): 2022 2021 Interest income (expense), net $ (15,616 ) $ (7,387 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ 67 $ (127 ) Other income (expense), net $ (371 ) $ (368 ) 41 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $15.6 million in 2022 versus $7.4 million in 2021. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 3.24% and 2.16% during 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.2 million for both 2022 and 2021, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were nominal in both 2022 and 2021. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expenses were nominal in both 2022 and 2021. Income Tax Provision We recorded a tax provision of $13.1 million in 2022, compared to a tax provision of $5.8 million in 2021. The effective tax rate for 2022 was 15% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 10.4% of income before income taxes for 2021. Our effective tax rate for 2022 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, $4.5 million benefit for foreign derived intangible income, $3.1 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, $2.3 million benefit from R&D and other tax credits, partially offset by $2.0 million increase in valuation allowances and a $2.1 million detriment related to disallowed compensation. Our effective tax rate for 2021 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, $2.6 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, $5.1 million benefit from share-based compensation, $1.4 million benefit from R&D and other tax credits, and $1.2 million benefit for foreign derived intangible income, partially offset by $1.1 million detriment related to disallowed compensation, and a $0.9 million detriment on the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD’) Pillar Two Model Rules to be effective as of January 2024. These rules will impose a global corporate minimum income tax rate of 15%. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on these rules. The Company is analyzing the impact and will continue to monitor the related developments. Net Income The consolidated net income was $74.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the impact of the factors described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $350.0 million by exercising the accordion feature under our revolving credit agreement. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of global pandemics and geopolitical conflicts, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in 42 certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the operating income and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, as local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us, there is no assurance that our subsidiaries will be permitted to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of December 31, 2022, $68.4 million of our $100.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of North America. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our senior credit facilities. Approximately $150.3 million of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of North America as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs from various subsidiaries. We deferred $2.8 million of U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. We paid $1.4 million of such deferred payroll tax payments during 2021. The remaining $1.4 million was paid during 2022. In May 2021, our shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. Our Board of Directors may designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares in order to raise additional capital, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share. As of December 31, 2022, no preferred shares were issued and outstanding. Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the second quarter of 2022, we repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $9.5 million at an average price of $118.97 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We have completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan and have repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares at an average price of $94.57 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $50.0 million worth of common shares, effective after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. Share repurchases have been made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $0.5 million at an average price of $116.95 per share under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2022, we had $49.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase Plan. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million that began in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at anytime until maturity. On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility 43 commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On June 2, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment revised our consolidated leverage ratio definition (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) allowing for the use of up to $25 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as a reduction to consolidated funded indebtedness (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). On October 5, 2021, we entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion feature. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date thereof from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion feature from $200.0 million to $350.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, we had $81.9 (€76.6) million term loan and $358.4 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00% to 0.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans, and Letters of Credit Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75% and 1.75% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.30% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $150.3 million and $290.0 million, respectively. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, we believe, are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2022: Requirement Actual as of December 31, 2022 Maximum consolidated leverage ratio (1) 3.50 2.24 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 7.74 In addition, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents totaled $100.1 million as of December 31, 2022, versus $117.4 million as of December 31, 2021. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to $59.0 million of debt repayments, $46.3 million of contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions, $22.4 million of cash considerations paid for the MPH acquisition, $19.6 million of capital expenditures, $11.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $10.0 million of repurchases of shares, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment, partially offset by $69.9 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the contingent consideration payment for the acquisition of ATI In4dustrial Automation Inc. (“ATI”) and the cash consideration for the MPH acquisition and cash provided by operating activities of $90.8 million. 44 The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands): 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 100,105 $ 117,393 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 90,779 $ 94,625 Net cash used in investing activities $ (42,541 ) $ (306,704 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (60,154 ) $ 204,753 Unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility, end of year $ 336,587 $ 348,421 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $90.8 million in 2022, versus $94.6 million in 2021. Cash provided by operating activities decreased from 2021 primarily due to a $48.6 million increase in inventories driven by increased customer demand and higher raw material purchases, and a bonus payout in 2022 of $8.4 million compared to no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual bonus plan, partially offset by an increase in operating profit as a result of higher revenue. Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires R&D expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing our cash taxes and deferred tax assets. As this provision under the TCJA was not deferred, modified, or repealed with retroactive effect going back to January 1, 2022 during 2022, our operating cash flows have decreased by approximately $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 as a direct result. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $42.5 million in 2022, primarily driven by the MPH acquisition. We paid cash consideration of $22.4 million, net of cash acquired. We also paid capital expenditures of $19.6 million and a contingent consideration payment of $1.5 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We received $0.8 million net working capital adjustment in 2022 related to our ATI acquisition. Cash used in investing activities was $306.7 million in 2021, primarily driven by the ATI and SEM acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid cash considerations of $284.7 million (net of cash acquired of $14.6 million). We also paid capital expenditures of $20.0 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2022. We expect to use approximately $25 million to $30 million in 2023 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses, which includes a significant one-time facility buildout project in the U.K. for our Solid State and Ultrafast Lasers products. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $60.2 million in 2022, primarily due to $59.0 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $46.3 million of contingent consideration payments related to prior year acquisitions, $11.7 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $10.0 million of repurchases of common stock, and $2.5 million of debt issuance costs in connection with the Fifth Amendment, partially offset by $69.9 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the contingent consideration paid for the ATI acquisition and the cash consideration paid for the MPH acquisition. Cash provided by financing activities was $204.8 million in 2021, primarily due to $280.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions, partially offset by $32.4 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $30.8 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $8.7 million of payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement, and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to prior year acquisitions. In 2023, we are contractually required to make $4.8 million in repayments under our term loan facility. In addition, we may make optional repayments under our revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities. 45 Other Liquidity Matters Pension Plans We maintain a defined benefit pension plan (the “U.K. Plan”) in Novanta Technologies U.K. Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the participants’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan. Our funding policy is to fund the U.K. Plan based on actuarial methods as permitted by the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used, such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality rates, retail price inflation and other market driven assumptions. Each assumption used represents one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known, including actual return on plan assets and pension payments to plan participants. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan by $2.0 million. Based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, our annual funding contributions are expected to be approximately $1.0 million in 2023 and will increase by 2.9% per year until the next statutory funding valuation date in 2024. Material Cash Requirements Senior Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2022, we had $81.9 million (€76.6 million) term loan and $358.4 million revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of approximately €1.1 million ($1.2 million) with the final installment of €58.5 million ($62.6 million) due upon maturity in March 2027. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity in March 2027. As of December 31, 2022, the future interest payments under our Senior Credit Facilities are expected to be approximately $96.5 million through maturity based on the current contractual term, with $23.4 million payable within the next twelve months. These estimates are based on current interest rates on floating rate obligations, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for the remainder of the contractual life of both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and the current commitment fee rate was used for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2022. These estimates also assume only quarterly term loan payments are made and outstanding revolving credit facility remains unchanged throughout the contractual term. The actual interest payments will vary due to changes in our debt level and interest rate. See Note 11, “Debt,” in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our debt obligations and the timing of expected future payments. Operating and Finance Leases We have entered into various lease agreements for office and manufacturing facilities, vehicles, and equipment used in the normal course of business. Undiscounted operating and finance lease obligations were $66.5 million, with $10.3 million payable within the next twelve months. See Note 12, “Leases,” in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2022, we had $145.0 million of purchase obligations, with $142.7 million payable within the next twelve months. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, valuation of contingent 46 consideration obligations, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606 includes the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. We occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. We generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 36 months. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of the costs to service warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue. We expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. Inventories . Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, customs duties and trade tariffs on imported materials and components, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, storage, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or trailing historical usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our operating income. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher operating income than expected in that period. 47 Share-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. In addition to service-based awards granted to a wider employee base and stock options granted to certain members of the executive management team, we typically grant three types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”), operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”), and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). In January 2022, the Company granted Adjusted EBITDA performance-based restricted stock units to ATI employees (“ATI-PSUs”). For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the vesting period of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. For stock options, share-based compensation expenses are recognized based on the fair value of the stock options, which is determined using Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the date of grant. Shared-based compensation expenses related to stock options are recognized on a straight-line basis ratably over the vesting period of the awards. Black-Scholes option pricing model includes various assumptions, including the expected term of the award, the expected volatility and the expected risk-free interest rate over the expected term of the award, expected dividend payments, and the fair value of the common stock underlying the awards. For EPS-PSUs, OCF-PSUs and ATI-PSUs, share-based compensation expenses are recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections as of the end of each period. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the estimated probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the levels of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expenses associated with EPS-PSUs, OCF-PSUs and ATI-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, share-based compensation expenses are recognized based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. Shared-based compensation expenses related to TSR-PSUs are recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years, regardless of whether the target relative total shareholder return is achieved. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement in a large number of simulated scenarios. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model include risk-free interest rate and expected stock price volatility of both the Company’s common shares and the Russell 2000 index. Valuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Key assumptions used to value identifiable intangible assets typically include revenue growth rates and projected cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, technology obsolescence curves, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination. The estimated fair value of real estate assets acquired in a business combination is estimated based on comparable sales information and other market data, if available, as well as using an income or cost approach, specifically the direct capitalization and replacement value approaches. The direct capitalization and replacement value approaches use key assumptions such as market rent estimates, capitalization rates, local multipliers and remaining useful life of the real estate assets. Assumptions used are subject to management judgment and changes in those assumptions could impact the estimation of the fair value. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the estimated useful life assumptions for identifiable intangible assets, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. We evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit levels which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review 48 factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit as of the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is performed. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. The DCF method requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit’s operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Factors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following: The occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified. The most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, using a quantitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. Accounting for Income Taxes . As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet. 49 Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period in which such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period in which such determination is made. In conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2022, we established a valuation allowance of $2.0 million recorded on state R&D credits, net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, potential for carryback and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $4.2 million, of which $3.7 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, we may need to recognize up to $0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $330.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is approximately $3.6 million. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to product quality, labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statements. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have a significant effect on us. 50 Item 7A. Quantita tive and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We address market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect our operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposures are the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and with intercompany trading partners that are eliminated in consolidation. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign currency contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecasted transactions. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency contracts that hedge these exposures. We had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling $117.1 million and net fair value of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $0.2 million increase in the net fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2022. By contrast, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $0.2 million decrease in the net fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2022. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. We had $440.3 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2022. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2022 would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $4.4 million. 51 Ite m 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOVANTA INC. INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm – PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 53 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 55 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021and 2020 56 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021and 2020 57 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021and 2020 58 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021and 2020 59 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 60 52 Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Novanta Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 53 Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition The Company’s revenue was $860.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, management recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness, accuracy and existence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, including purchase orders, invoices, and proof of shipment and (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of December 31, 2022 and, for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, including invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts, where applicable. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 1, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. 54 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., applied on a consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses. The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of its products. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay by conducting a credit review which includes consideration of established credit rating or an internal assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness based on an analysis of their payment history when a credit rating is not available. The Company monitors its credit exposure through active review of customer balances. The Company’s expected loss methodology for accounts receivable is developed through consideration of factors including, but not limit to, historical collection experience, current customer credit ratings, current customer financial condition, current and future economic and market condition, and age of the receivables. Charges related to credit losses are included as selling, general and administrative expenses and are recorded in the period that the outstanding receivables are determined to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is certain that the receivable will not be recovered. 60 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands): 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 556 $ 274 $ 297 Addition to credit loss expense 532 121 158 Credit loss resulting from acquisitions — 216 — Write-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 92 ) ( 45 ) ( 207 ) Exchange rate changes ( 1 ) ( 10 ) 26 Balance at end of year $ 995 $ 556 $ 274 Inventories Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, customs duties, trade tariffs on imported materials and components, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, storage, disposal and transportation. The Company periodically reviews inventory quantities on hand and for excess or obsolescence by comparing on hand quantities to the forecasted product demand and production requirements or trailing historical usage of each product. The Company records a charge to cost of revenue for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation of its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from 10 to 30 years for buildings and building improvements, and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the lease terms, including any renewal period options that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Certain costs to develop software for internal use are capitalized when the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” are met. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities acquired in a business combination. Allocations of the purchase price are based upon a valuation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure their current fair values exceed their carrying values. The Company’s most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The fair values of intangible assets are based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of the acquired companies and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews the useful life assumptions, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Costs associated with patent and intellectual property applications, renewals or extensions are typically expensed as incurred. The Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is at least one level below the reportable segments. 61 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 Impairment Charges Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —Goodwill and Other.” The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually at a reporting unit level, which is generally at least one level below a reportable segment, as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the second quarter, and more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company will also reassess the continuing classification of these intangible assets as indefinite-lived when circumstances change such that the useful life may no longer be considered indefinite. The fair values of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using the relief from royalty method, based on forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The carrying amounts of definite-lived long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value is generally determined by comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to its undiscounted future cash flows. When this test indicates a potential for impairment, a fair value assessment is performed. Once an impairment is determined and measured, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Revenue Recognition See Note 3 for the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are included in current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of the Company’s lease arrangements include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. 62 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 Research and Development and Engineering Costs Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. These costs are expensed as incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company records expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company also grants share-based awards that vest based on specified performance conditions or market conditions. Share-based compensation expenses for awards with performance conditions are recognized ratably over their vesting periods when it is probable that the performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the estimated levels of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Accordingly, share-based compensation expenses for awards with performance conditions may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against the performance targets. Share-based compensation expenses for awards with market conditions are based on the grant-date fair value, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model, and are recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expenses for awards with market conditions will not be affected by the number of common shares that will ultimately be issued upon vesting at the end of the performance period. The Company also grants stock options to certain members of the executive management team. Share-based compensation expenses associated with stock options are based on the grant-date fair value, determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and are recognized on a straight-line basis ratably over the respective vesting period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and were not material for 2022, 2021 and 2020. Restructuring, Acquisition and Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. Accounting for Income Taxes The asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the related tax benefits will not be realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released. 63 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 The majority of the Company’s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of Canada. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. Consequently, the Company generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that the Company intends to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses foreign currency contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The time duration of these foreign currency contracts approximates the underlying foreign currency transaction exposures, generally less than three months. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. 64 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 is elective. In March 2022, the Company amended the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and replaced LIBOR with SOFR as the new reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings. The ASU did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 as of January 1, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2021-08 did not have any material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue The Company accounts for its revenue transactions in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of control over goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. 65 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping and Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 36 months . The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated warranty cost is recorded in cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 , contract liabilities were $ 8.4 million and $ 7.3 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2022 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations, partially offset by $ 5.3 million of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2021. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 18 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 66 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 4. Business Combinations 2022 Acquisitions On August 11, 2022 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of MPH Medical Devices S.R.O. (""MPH""), a Czech Republic-based manufacturer of medical consumables with plastics specialization in making medical disposable tube set products, for a total purchase price of € 21.8 million ($ 22.4 million), net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The addition of MPH has expanded the Company's capacity and capabilities in the medical disposable tube set products within the Vision reportable segment. The acquisition of MPH has been accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the real property were based on valuations using an income and cost approach, specifically the direct capitalization method and the replacement value approaches. These approaches are subject to key assumptions including market rent estimates, capitalization rates, local multipliers and remaining useful life. The sales comparison approach was not considered due to the limited data available on reasonable comparable properties. The Company's estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regard to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. T he total purchase price for MPH was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 182 Accounts receivable 1,658 Inventories 957 Property, plant and equipment 12,094 Goodwill 9,863 Other assets 163 Total assets acquired 24,917 Accounts payable 562 Deferred tax liabilities 1,124 Other liabilities 664 Total liabilities assumed 2,350 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 22,567 Less: cash acquired 182 Purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 22,385 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 9.9 million of goodwill. As the MPH acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition, the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated future benefits from the expansion of the Company's manufacturing capacity and capabilities for the medical disposal tube set products. The operating results of MPH were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on August 12, 2022. MPH contributed revenues of $ 5.2 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of MPH, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2021, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2021. 2021 Acquisitions On August 30, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for a total purchase price of $ 213.2 million, net of cash acquired and net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of $ 169.2 million cash paid at closing, net of cash acquired and net working capital adjustments, and $ 44.0 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration as of the acquisition date. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The Company expects that the addition of ATI will complement and add intelligent technology solutions to further expand the Company’s position in mission critical robotic applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. 67 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 On August 31, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated motion control solutions and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total purchase price of $ 114.7 million, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The Company expects that the addition of SEM will complement and expand the Company’s presence in life science applications and industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisitions of ATI and SEM have been accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates, technology obsolescence curves, and EBITDA margins. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill for each acquisition. ATI The final purchase price for ATI was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 10,709 Accounts receivable 12,596 Inventories 18,151 Property, plant and equipment 4,618 Operating lease assets 11,263 Intangible assets 52,800 Goodwill 134,420 Other assets 229 Total assets acquired 244,786 Accounts payable 5,135 Current portion of operating lease liabilities 1,740 Operating lease liabilities 9,525 Other liabilities 4,452 Total liabilities assumed 20,852 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 223,934 Less: cash acquired 10,709 Add: net working capital adjustment 820 Less: contingent consideration 44,000 Initial purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 170,045 The fair value of intangible assets for ATI is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 19,800 15 years Customer relationships 23,900 15 years Trademarks and trade names 5,600 15 years Backlog 3,500 1 year Total $ 52,800 68 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 52.8 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 134.4 million of goodwill. Goodwill amounting to $ 134.4 million is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) ATI’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) ATI’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ATI’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ATI were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on August 31, 2021. ATI contributed revenues of $ 34.0 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 3.4 million to the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021. ATI’s profit before income taxes for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 3.5 million. SEM The final purchase price for SEM was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 3,881 Accounts receivable 4,240 Inventories 2,499 Property, plant and equipment 452 Intangible assets 54,570 Goodwill 68,291 Other assets 776 Total assets acquired 134,709 Accounts payable 1,325 Deferred tax liabilities 12,400 Other liabilities 2,420 Total liabilities assumed 16,145 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 118,564 Less: cash acquired 3,881 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 114,683 The fair value of intangible assets for SEM is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 9,110 15 years Customer relationships 41,740 20 years Trademarks and trade names 370 4 years Backlog 3,350 1 year Total $ 54,570 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 54.6 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 68.3 million of goodwill. As the SEM acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition for income tax purposes, the goodwill is no t expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) SEM’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) SEM’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of SEM’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. 69 NOVANTA INC.

Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts 72 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Contingent Considerations On August 30, 2021 , the Company acquired ATI. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI (the “Sellers”) are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration would be payable in 2022 after the Sellers and the Company agree on the final amount for the Adjusted EBITDA. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability was fully settled. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 44.0 million as of December 31, 2021. During 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 45.0 million based on the final determination of ATI’s 2021 Adjusted EBITDA. The Company made the contingent consideration payment of $ 45.0 million in August 2022. The estimated fair value of $ 44.0 million included in the determination of the purchase price is reported as a cash outflow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2022 while the remaining $ 1.0 million payment is reported as a cash outflow from operating activities. On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). The Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million) as of December 31, 2021. The Company made the second installment payment of € 0.3 million ($ 0.4 million) in March 2022. Based on the revenue performance and revenue projections as of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million). The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. On April 16, 2019 , the Company acquired Ingenia CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability were recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability was fully settled. The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million) as of December 31,2020. The Company made the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021 and adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration to € 1.5 million ($ 1.7 million) as of December 31, 2021. During the three months ended July 1, 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.8 million ($ 1.9 million). The Company made the final installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 1.9 million) in July 2022. The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. 73 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability have been recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and are amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. Based on revenue achievements against the target through the end of 2021, the Company recognized an aggregate fair value of € 5.5 million ($ 6.3 million) for the acquired intangible assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020, the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021, and the final installment payment of € 1.3 million ($ 1.5 million) in March 2022. The installment payments have been reported as cash outflows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods.

Changes in the fair value of Level 3 contingent considerations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were as follows (in thousands): Contingent Considerations Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 50,924 Payments ( 48,725 ) Fair value adjustments ( 1,382 ) Effect of foreign exchange rates ( 392 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 425 See Note 11 for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt and Note 14 for a discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets. 8. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of December 31, 2022 , the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 117.1 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 , the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 50.0 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized aggregate net loss of $( 2.4 ) million, net gain of $ 1.3 million, and net gain of $ 1.3 million, respectively, from the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts, which were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 9. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing consolidated net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effect of outstanding common share equivalents. The dilutive effects of outstanding common share equivalents, including outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”) and other performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), are determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares from the TSR-PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares from other PSUs are included in the weighted average common share calculation only when the performance targets have been achieved based on the cumulative achievement against the performance targets as of the end of the reporting period. 75 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (in thousands, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 74,051 $ 50,331 $ 44,521 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,652 35,396 35,144 Dilutive potential common shares 257 385 510 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,909 35,781 35,654 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 91 13 13 Earnings per Common Share: Basic $ 2.08 $ 1.42 $ 1.27 Diluted $ 2.06 $ 1.41 $ 1.25 For the year ended December 31, 2022 , 12 thousand non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and 37 thousand operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 50 thousand performance-based restricted stock units granted to ATI Industrial Automation employees (""ATI-PSUs"") were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2022.

As amended, the Senior Credit Facilities mature in March 2027 and include an uncommitted accordion option pursuant to which the commitments under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $ 350.0 million in aggregate, subject to certain customary conditions. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion option. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On October 5, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion option. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 200.0 million, from $ 495.0 million to $ 695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion option to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. On March 10, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment (the ""Fifth Amendment"") to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to extend the maturity date from December 31, 2024 to March 10, 2027, update the pricing grid, replace LIBOR with SOFR as the reference rate for U.S. dollar borrowings, and increase the uncommitted accordion option from $ 200.0 million to $ 350.0 million. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.00 % to 0.75 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Term SOFR Loans, Alternative Currency Loans, and Letter of Credit Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.75 % and 1.75 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20 % and 0.30 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) limitations on restricted payments, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, provided that the Company and its subsidiaries may repurchase their equity interests so long as, immediately after giving effect to the repurchase, the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio is no more than 3.25 :1.00, with a step up to 3.75 :1.00 for four consecutive quarters following an acquisition with an aggregate consideration greater than or equal to $50.0 million, and the satisfaction of other customary conditions; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company and its 78 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 subsidiaries; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, such as maintaining a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 :1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 :1.00. The maximum consolidated leverage ratio will increase to 4.00 :1.00 for four consecutive quarters following an acquisition with an aggregate consideration greater than or equal to $ 50.0 million . As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding principal under the Company’s term loan facility is scheduled to be repaid as follows (in thousands): Principal Amount 2023 $ 4,832 2024 4,832 2025 4,832 2026 4,832 2027 62,564 Total debt repayments $ 81,892 The outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility is payable in quarterly installments of € 1.1 million that began in March 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity. The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through March 2027 . The Company may be required to prepay outstanding loans under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the net proceeds from certain asset dispositions and incurrences of certain debt. At the election of the Company, and so long as no default shall have occurred, the Company may reinvest all, or any portion, of the net proceeds from such asset dispositions or incurrences of debt within a year. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had $ 336.6 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. Excluding commitment fees, the weighted average interest rate for the Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 5.13 % as of December 31, 2022 . The commitment fee rate for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility was approximately 0.28 % as of December 31, 2022. Guarantees The Senior Credit Facilities is guaranteed by Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Med X Change, Inc., Novanta Medical Technologies Corp., W.O.M. World of Medicine USA, Inc., Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta U.K. Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies U.K. Limited (collectively, “Guarantors”). Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest and fees under the Senior Credit Facilities, when due and payable, whether at maturity, by required prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise. In addition, Guarantors guarantee the due and punctual payment, fees and interest on the overdue principal of the Senior Credit Facilities and the due and punctual performance of all obligations of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees that in the event of any extension, renewal, amendment, refinancing or modification of any of the Senior Credit Facilities, amounts due will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities or any collections from, or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor of its pro rata share based on the adjusted net assets of each Guarantor. If at any time any payment of any of the obligations of the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, a Guarantor or otherwise, the Guarantees will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not been made. Each Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee and its obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) the Guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; or (ii) payment in full of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facilities and all other obligations. 79 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Guarantors could be required to make under the Guarantee is the principal amount of the Senior Credit Facilities plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, as of December 31, 2022, the Guarantors were not expected to be required to perform under the Guarantee. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Deferred Financing Costs In connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, the Company capitalized an additional $ 2.5 million of deferred financing costs and recorded a $ 0.6 million loss from the write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs previously capitalized in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities. The Company allocated the deferred financing costs between the term loan and the revolving credit facility based on the maximum borrowing capacity and amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs was $ 1.2 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 1.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value of Debt As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 12. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2023 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms. The following table summarizes the components of lease costs included in the statements of operations for the periods indicated (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost $ 10,387 $ 8,533 $ 7,693 Finance lease cost Amortization of right-of-use assets 602 602 989 Interest on lease liabilities 308 340 432 Variable lease cost 1,145 1,074 1,336 Total lease cost $ 12,442 $ 10,549 $ 10,450 80 NOVANTA INC.

Stockholders’ Equity and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of December 31, 2022 , no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Shares The Company has an unlimited number of non-par value common shares authorized for issuance. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, and to share ratably in the Company’s assets legally available for distribution to shareholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common shares have no redemption or conversion rights. Common Share Repurchases The Company’s Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at the Company’s discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, market prices of the Company’s common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to the Company’s employees and directors, the plans do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2019, the Company repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 83.71 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. During 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share. During 2022, the Company completed the 2018 Repurchase Plan and repurchased 80 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 9.5 million at an average price of $ 118.97 per share. From the inception of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, the Company repurchased a cumulative total of 264 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 25.0 million at an average price of $ 94.57 per share. 82 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of common shares. During 2022, the Company repurchased 4 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.5 million at an average price of $ 116.95 under the 2020 Repurchase plan. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $ 49.5 million available for future share repurchases under the 2020 Repurchase plan. 2010 Incentive Award Plan In November 2010, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan under which the Company may grant share-based compensation awards to employees, consultants and directors. In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved an amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the “Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan”). The maximum number of shares which can be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan is 6,148,613 , subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and stock payments (collectively referred to as “Awards”). The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for specific limits on the number of shares with respect to Awards that may be granted to any person during any calendar year and the amount of cash that can be paid with respect to Awards to any one person during any calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan will expire and no further Awards may be granted after May 13, 2031 . As of December 31, 2022 , there were 2,063,234 shares available for future Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. Shares subject to Awards that have expired, forfeited or settled in cash, or repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the awardee may be added back to the number of shares available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan and may be granted as new Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares will not be added back to the number of shares available for grant: (a) shares that are used to pay the exercise price for an option, (b) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to any Award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to the extent they exceed the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the tax liability based on minimum withholding rates, (c) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, (d) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and (e) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares issued to satisfy Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan may be previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares repurchased on the open market. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in operating income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 18,182 $ 17,255 $ 14,550 Research and development and engineering 2,414 2,294 3,301 Cost of revenue 2,512 3,008 4,684 Restructuring and acquisition related costs — 3,049 584 Total share-based compensation expense $ 23,108 $ 25,606 $ 23,119 The expense recorded during each of the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 included $ 1.1 million, $ 1.1 million and $1 .0 million, respectively, related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company’s outstanding equity awards for which compensation expense will be recognized in the future consisted of time-based restricted stock units, performance stock units and stock options granted under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Company expects to record an aggregate share-based compensation expense of $ 33.5 million, net of estimated forfeitures, over a weighted average period of 1.27 years subsequent to December 31, 2022, for all outstanding Awards as of December 31, 2022. 83 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued to employees with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. Outstanding DSUs are converted into common shares upon Board members' resignation or retirement from the Board. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , 52 thousand shares of outstanding DSUs were converted into common shares upon the retirement or resignation of certain board members. There were 38 thousand and 91 thousand DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective period. The table below summarizes activities during 2022 relating to restricted and deferred stock units issued and outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Restricted and Deferred Stock Units (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2021 292 $ 115.42 Granted 120 $ 136.53 Vested ( 156 ) $ 110.32 Forfeited ( 18 ) $ 127.46 Unvested at December 31, 2022 238 $ 128.26 1.05 years $ 32,175 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 220 $ 127.92 1.05 years $ 29,939 The total fair value of restricted stock units and deferred stock units that vested in 2022, based on the market price of the underlying shares as of the date of vesting, was $ 21.5 million. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based restricted stock units to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of a three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over a three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 84 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over a three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In January 2022, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock units to ATI employees (""ATI-PSUs""). The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting is determined based on cumulative Adjusted EBITDA performance over a four-year performance period compared to specified targets and will be in the range of zero to 100 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the four-year performance period. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. In February 2021, the Company granted operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) to certain members of the executive management team. Upon completion of the requisite service periods, the OCF-PSUs will vest in two tranches if the Company achieves the cumulative operating cash flow performance target for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors as of the date of grant. The first fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the four-year service period from the date of grant and the remaining fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the five-year service period from the date of grant. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the expectation that 100 percent of the OCF-PSUs are deemed probable of vesting. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made.

The expected volatility was determined based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common shares over the expected option term. Risk-free interest rate was based upon treasury instrument whose term was six months longer than the expected option term. The expected annual dividend yield is zero as the Company does not have plans to issue dividends. 86 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 14. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution employee retirement savings plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. The Company matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis of percentages specified in each plan. The Company’s matching contributions to the plans were $ 5.9 million, $ 4.4 million and $ 4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Defined Benefit Plan The Company maintains a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003. Benefits under the U.K. Plan were based on the participants’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen in 2003, adjusted for inflation. The Company continues to fund the plan in accordance with the pension regulations in the U.K. The net periodic pension cost is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following components (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Components of the net periodic pension cost: Interest cost $ 669 $ 554 $ 736 Expected return on plan assets ( 1,286 ) ( 1,120 ) ( 1,340 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 380 928 686 Amortization of prior service cost 32 31 29 Net periodic pension cost $ ( 205 ) $ 393 $ 111 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average discount rate 1.8 % 1.2 % 1.9 % Weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.2 % 2.5 % 3.6 % The actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 Weighted-average discount rate 4.8 % 1.8 % Rate of inflation 2.7 % 3.2 % The discount rates used are derived from (AA) corporate bonds that have maturities approximating the terms of the pension obligations under the U.K. Plan. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the historical performance of the major asset classes held by the U.K. Plan and current forecasts of future rates of return for these asset classes. 87 NOVANTA INC.

Based on the results of the most recent valuation, the Company’s annual contributions will be approximately $ 1.0 million in 2023 and will increase by 2.9 % per year thereafter. Fair Value of Plan Assets The trustee of the U.K. Plan has the fiduciary responsibilities to manage the plan assets in consultation with the Company. The overall objective is to invest plan assets in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve balanced growth through a combination of investments in equities for long-term growth and investments in debt instruments that match a portion of the expected future benefit payments and to maintain adequate liquidity to make pension payments to pensioners.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 Deferred income taxes result principally from temporary differences in the recognition of certain revenue and expense items and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for financial and tax reporting purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Losses $ 9,954 $ 9,358 Operating lease liabilities 11,117 12,200 Compensation related deductions 9,010 6,795 Inventories 9,368 6,594 Tax credits 2,624 2,786 R&D Capitalization 13,623 — Warranty 836 700 Other 284 403 Total deferred tax assets 56,816 38,836 Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets ( 14,568 ) ( 12,608 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 42,248 $ 26,228 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation $ ( 4,049 ) $ ( 2,585 ) Amortization ( 26,746 ) ( 32,117 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 10,477 ) ( 11,667 ) Deferred revenue ( 3,057 ) $ ( 1,391 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ ( 44,329 ) $ ( 47,760 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 2,081 ) $ ( 21,532 ) In determining its income tax provisions, the Company calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate jurisdiction. The Company then considered a number of factors, including positive and negative evidence related to the realization of its deferred tax assets, to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to its deferred tax assets. Beginning in January 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) requires that research and development (“R&D”) expenditures be capitalized and amortized for income tax purposes over five years for domestic research and fifteen years for foreign research, rather than being deducted as incurred. This has the effect of increasing the Company’s cash taxes and deferred tax assets. Since January 2022, the Company has recognized deferred tax assets of $ 13.6 million for the relevant R&D expenditures. This provision also has an indirect benefit of 2.7 % on the Company’s effective tax rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, as the Company’s estimated Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction has increased as a result of increased U.S. taxable income. In 2022, the Company recorded an additional $ 2.0 million valuation allowance. In 2021, the Company recorded an additional $ 0.9 million valuation allowance. In 2020, the Company reversed valuation allowance of $ 0.7 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to current and forecast taxable income. Valuation allowances continue to be provided on the remaining balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that they will be realized. In addition, the Company has established a valuation allowance on state R&D credits in 2022 which the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that they will be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 4.4 million (tax effected). Of this amount, approximately $ 3.9 million relates to Canada and begins to expire starting in 2033 and had a full valuation allowance. The remainder $ 0.5 million relates to various U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions, of which $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely and the remaining $ 0.4 million will begin to expire in 2023 through 2036 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.6 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely and had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 4.9 million and $ 0.7 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. 91 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.5 million (tax effected). Of this amount, approximately $ 2.9 million relates to Canada and begin to expire starting in 2033 and have a full valuation allowance. The remainder $ 0.6 million relates to various U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions, of which $ 0.2 million can be carried forward indefinitely and the remaining $ 0.4 million will begin to expire in 2022 through 2036 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.9 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely and had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.1 million and $ 0.8 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 3.0 million, which consist of approximately $ 2.3 million relates to the U.S. and other immaterial foreign jurisdictions that will expire through 2038 and $ 0.7 million tax credit carryforwards related to Canada that can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has a $ 2.5 million valuation allowance on the tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 3.8 million. Of this amount approximately $ 2.6 million relates primarily to the U.S. and other immaterial foreign jurisdictions and will expire through 2042 . The remaining $ 1.2 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 0.5 million expired in 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $ 330.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The estimated unrecognized income tax and foreign withholding tax liability on these undistributed earnings is approximately $ 3.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 4.2 million, of which $ 3.7 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to reverse up to $ 0.5 million of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all significant income tax uncertainties. The reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 4,929 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 476 Additions for tax positions of prior years 356 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 5 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 498 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2020 5,258 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,162 Additions for tax positions of prior years 9 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 41 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 1,591 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2021 4,797 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 553 Additions for tax positions of prior years 34 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 563 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 572 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 4,249 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax provision.

The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnificbation agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities, whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever, of Novanta Technologies U.K. Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties The Company maintains financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. From time to time, certain of these instruments may subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk whereby one institution may hold a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents, or one customer may represent a large portion of the accounts receivable balances. 95 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022 There was no significant concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s position in trade accounts receivable as no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is generally minimized because of the diversification of the Company’s operations, as well as its large customer base and its geographic dispersion. Certain of the components and materials included in the Company’s products are currently obtained from single source suppliers. There can be no assurance that a disruption of the supply of such components and materials would not create substantial manufacturing delays and additional cost to the Company. The Company’s operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, rapidly changing technologies, and international operations. 18. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. It em 9A. Controls and Procedures The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are included in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in those certifications. Those certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures as of December 31, 2022 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2022. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, we completed the process of incorporating the internal controls for ATI Industrial Automation Inc. (“ATI”) and Novanta Motion (“SEM”), both business acquisitions during 2021, into our internal control over financial reporting and extending our Section 404 compliance program under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable rules and regulations under such Act to include ATI and SEM. Except as otherwise described above, there has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making their assessment, our management utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 ) , issued by COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 100 It em 9B.

Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. The Company was founded and initially incorporated in Massachusetts in 1968 as General Scanning, Inc. (“General Scanning”). In 1999, General Scanning merged with Lumonics Inc. The post-merger entity, GSI Lumonics Inc., continued under the laws of the Province of New Brunswick, Canada. In 2005, the Company changed its name to GSI Group Inc. Through a series of strategic divestitures and acquisitions, the Company transformed from one that was more focused on the semiconductor industry to one that primarily develops and supplies components and sub-systems to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The Company changed its name to Novanta Inc. in May 2016. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and 1 - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, intelligent end-of-arm robotic technology solutions, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites, and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Recent Developments Acquisition of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for an upfront cash purchase price of $169.2 million, net of cash acquired and estimated working capital adjustments, and $44.0 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022 based on a multiple of the standalone ATI Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. We expect that the addition of ATI will complement and add intelligent technology solutions to further expand our position in mission critical robotic applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Acquisition of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. On August 31, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated motion control solutions and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total cash purchase price of $114.7 million, inclusive of post-closing working capital adjustments and net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of SEM will complement and expand our presence in life science applications and solutions for industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities and have adapted our COVID-19 safety measures as the pandemic and related government mandates evolved over the past two years. We expect to continue some of these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment, weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully, reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with COVID-19 may continue to affect our business for the foreseeable future. Through December 31, 2021, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply 2 chain , d isruptions to our suppliers and/ or sub-suppliers caused by these events could further challenge our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships . To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used where feasible without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Despite our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of labor, freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Acquisitions We continuously evaluate our business mix and financial performance. Since 2013, we have executed a series of acquisitions in line with our strategy. The following table summarizes significant acquisitions since 2013: Company Year of Acquisition Total Purchase Price (in millions) ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. 2021 $ 223.9 Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. 2021 $ 118.6 ARGES GmbH 2019 $ 73.2 Zettlex Holdings Limited 2018 $ 32.0 Laser Quantum Limited (24%) (1) 2018 $ 45.1 Laser Quantum Limited (35%) 2017 $ 31.1 W.O.M.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2021, the medical market accounted for approximately 52% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, 6 changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2021, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 48% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the PMI on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory stocking requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital . Customers We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue from an OEM customer in the medical end market which accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue . Our customers include many OEMs who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on several factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. Seasonality While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the lower seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles. Backlog As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our consolidated backlog was approximately $568.8 million and $239.6 million, respectively. Most orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve months. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog typically is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. During 2021, we experienced notable increases in lead times for our customer orders, caused by higher customer demand and unprecedented raw materials shortages and supply chain disruptions caused by both the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic and geopolitical factors. Manufacturing Manufacturing functions are performed internally either when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process, or for cost related reasons, while other portions of the manufacture of our products are outsourced to highly qualified third parties. Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse, New York; Bradenton, Florida; Mukilteo, Washington, and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision 7 Motion segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Apex, North Carolina; Marlborough, Connecticut; Rocklin , California; Poole and Cambridge , United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. The majority of our products are produced in manufacturing facilities certified under ISO 9001 certification, while most of our products manufactured for the medical market are produced in factories under ISO 13485 certification. Our manufacturing facilities in Ludwigsstadt, Germany, Stockport and Taunton, United Kingdom, and Suzhou, China are ISO 14001 certified. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders, imaging informatics, and medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Marketing, Sales and Distribution We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. We also use distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Competition We encounter aggressive and strong competition in virtually all the markets, applications, and technologies we serve. Due to the wide and diverse range of products and technologies, we face many different types of competitors and competition. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small organizations producing a limited number of highly specialized products or services for specialized market segments. The competitive climate of many of the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and customer demands that require continuing investments by us. Our competitive success requires advances in technology and performance, improved price for performance ratios, demonstrated increased throughput performance for our customers products, lower total cost of ownership, product quality, depth of our application knowledge and expertise, reputation amongst customers, customer service and technical support, speed to market, geographical presence, and deep customer relationships. We believe that our products offer several competitive advantages for our customers, and the breadth of technologies we offer gives us deep applications knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs Raw Materials, Components and Supplies Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Patents and Intellectual Property We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold several registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole. 8 We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital We believe that our employees are our most important asset. The Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives. The CHRO and the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) regularly update our board of directors on the operation and status of these human capital activities, including, but not limited to, talent management, talent development, and succession planning. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 2,700 people, of which approximately 46% were in the United States, 42% in Europe, and 12% in Asia. We win with our customers by delivering new technology innovations through our engineering teams of approximately 600 employees. We believe that our employees have a meaningful role in helping us develop our culture. We utilize survey feedback mechanisms to measure employee engagement and organizational health. This enables us to gain insight into our current status and into areas where we can improve. We have conducted surveys of our entire employee population in each of last three years and we compare our employee engagement and organizational health scores against benchmark populations with our survey vendors. Following each survey cycle, we review the results across the company with our teams and develop specific action plans based on the feedback we receive. We execute on our action plans to improve our overall organizational health and employee engagement. All employees are responsible for upholding the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, suppliers or customers and provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, data privacy regulations and workplace harassment. Diversity and Inclusion The Novanta Way defines our performance culture and begins with building cohesive teams based on trust, commitment, and accountability. Diversity, equity, and inclusion are an integral part of our culture and will be leader led and embedded into our ways of working. Our diversity will be reflected in our governance, leadership, influence, and technical expertise at all levels in the organization. We do not tolerate discrimination and harassment. We expect our teams to respect our core values and conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. As of December 31, 2021, our board of directors was 67% comprised of men and 33% comprised of women. Women representation on our board of directors increased 8 percentage points in 2021 from 2020. As of March 1, 2022, our board of directors was 75% comprised of men and 25% of women. Underrepresented groups (defined as an individual who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, Native American, Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or two or more races or ethnicities) represented 11% of our board of directors as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our gender diversification efforts resulted in 36% of our workforce being women, which was an increase of one percentage point increase in women representation on our workforce from December 31, 2020. The proportion of women in management positions amounted to 25%, which is consistent with the prior year. During 2021, in line with our strategic initiative of increasing representation of employees from underrepresented communities, we launched a series of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives to accelerate the progress towards our goals by the year 2023. Compensation and Benefits We strive to provide market competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs, which vary by country, can include annual bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation awards, defined contribution retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, healthcare and other insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, health savings account with company matching contributions, paid time off, paid family leave, and tuition assistance. Certain U.S. facilities have a dedicated medical professional on site to provide basic healthcare services to employees, provide general first aid, assess employee health risks and promote employee health. Additionally, all U.S. employees and their families have access to video and telephonic Telemedicine support twenty-four hours a day. Our bonus and commission payment programs allow for higher payouts when goals are exceeded and lower payouts when goals are not achieved as planned. 9 Growth and Development We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Novanta an employer of choice. In certain countries, we offer college tuition reimbursement for eligible employees for undergraduate and graduate studies. In 2019, we founded Novanta University as a primary instrument of company-wide learning management. A full-time specialist and the Company’s human resources department coordinate the onboarding of new employees and administer the regular training program for the entire workforce, including both internal and external training courses. In addition to Novanta University, we utilize our Novanta Growth System, which provides processes, tools, and trainings with a focus on continuous improvement. In 2021, further investment was made in leadership development and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives with the creation of a department dedicated to deploying the Novanta Way culture through employee resource groups, learning initiatives for all employees and formal leadership development training programs. Safety and Wellbeing of Our Employees We provide mandatory safety trainings in our facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. In further support of our employees, we launched the global health and wellness resource center, “NovantaWELL”. The program is designed to give employees support, training, tools and coaching to help them stay healthy. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, working-from-home arrangements for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, reducing travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. Cybersecurity We have adopted and are implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The NIST CSF integrates industry standards and best practices to help organizations manage their cybersecurity risks. The NIST CSF helps organizations understand their cybersecurity risks (threats, vulnerabilities and impacts) and how to reduce these risks with customized measures, such as organization-wide cybersecurity awareness training. Additionally, we maintain cybersecurity insurance to mitigate risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches; however, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving areas of cyber risk. The Company’s Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee reviews quarterly with management and internal audit the Company’s cybersecurity program and related matters. There have been no material information security breaches for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Expenses incurred in connection with information security breaches have been immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Government Regulation Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government rules and regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies, and we monitor those changes closely. Environmental Regulations Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) 10 and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)). Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions that have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment. Medical Device Regulations Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (“the FDA”) and foreign regulatory authorities. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities as well as notified bodies. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements. 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending 11 on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is prepared by the manufacturer in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. I n these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Post-market Regulations After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: • establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; • QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; • labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; • FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; • clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices; • medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; • correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; • requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; • the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and • post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: • warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; • recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 12 • refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; • withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; • refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or • criminal prosecution. Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union and U.K. The European Union (“EU”) has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by the Council Directive 93/42/EEC (“Medical Devices Directive”) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (“Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted and renewed under the Medical Devices Directive. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance, market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire. According to the Medical Devices Regulation several transitional provisions are in place (Article 120) to avoid market disruption and allow a smooth transition from the Medical Devices Directive to the Medical Devices Regulation. Some device certificates issued under the Medical Devices Directive (“MDD certificates”) may remain valid until May 26, 2024, and some devices with MDD certificates may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. During the transition phase, products certified under the Medical Devices Directive and products certified under the Medical Devices Regulation will coexist on the market. Both will have equal status under the law, and no discrimination on eligibility criteria in public tenders may take place. Medical Devices Directive Under the Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements in the Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. To demonstrate compliance with the requirements in the Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-declare the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. If satisfied that a relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, a notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s). Medical Devices Regulation The recently effective Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. Unlike the Medical Devices Directive, the Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement it into national law. The new Medical Devices Regulation, among other things, strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available and establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market. As of May 26, 2021, regardless whether the devices are still marketed with MDD certificates, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the Medical Devices Regulation, including the obligations described below. All manufacturers placing medical devices into the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”) required to be taken by manufacturers must be reported to the 13 relevant authorities of the EU member states. FSCAs are defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation. According to the Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. United Kingdom Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain’s (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (“SI 2002 No 618”, as amended) whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules. By July 1, 2023, all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) mark in Great Britain, but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain. For further information regarding EU and U.K. healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business— We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products.” Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program. Federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the federal government information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. For further information regarding other healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products.” Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations Numerous state, federal and foreign laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, 14 including data breach notification laws, health information priva cy and security laws that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information , including HIPAA, could apply to our operations or the operations of our customers . In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“ CCPA ”) , the California Privacy Rights Act (“ CPRA ”) , and the General Data Protection Regulation (“ GDPR ”) , govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to make compliance efforts more challenging, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant penalties and restrictions on data processing .

Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. Risks Relating to Our Business Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses, capital expenditures and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of our customers’ capital expenditures or business activity. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. In particular, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020 and, to a lesser extent, in 2021. In addition, certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment sector, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have also faced increases in inflationary conditions in certain materials and components, and we expect these inflationary conditions to continue in 2022. These inflationary conditions have caused us to increase prices; however, such price increases may not be accepted by our customers or may not adequately offset the increases in our costs, thereby negatively affecting our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions, including inflationary conditions, could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. 15 The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to have prolonged adverse impact s on our business and results of operations. In 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and spread across the world. The pandemic and government measures taken in response have had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our business and the economy. We have experienced weakened demand from certain customers in the advanced industrial and medical end-markets, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have, at times, deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. Certain other customers have delayed their research and development programs, which has also negatively affected the demand for some of our products. We also faced, and expect to continue to face, difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to suppliers’ capacity constraints and shipping and transportation disruptions. These disruptions have adversely affected our ability to manufacture our products and meet our customers’ schedules. If we are not able to mitigate these disruptions effectively, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules would continue to be adversely affected, possibly materially, and our business would be harmed. Even if we are able to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components, they may cost more or be of lower quality, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. While the impact of the pandemic on our manufacturing capabilities and research and development activities has been limited to date, there can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products and to develop new products and technologies will not be disrupted in the future in case of a resurgence of the pandemic or related public health crisis from new mutations of the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, such as the continued geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the location, duration and magnitude of future waves of infection, new mutations of the virus, the availability, the adoption and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments against the virus and its variants, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, the European Union (“EU”), China and other countries. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions in the future, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets. There is no assurance that future resurgence of COVID-19 infections and further economic downturns will not cause volatilities in the capital markets, which may adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, such as what occurred in March and April 2020 and at various times in 2021 upon the discovery of new variants. Our business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility into future business declines. During a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand has prompted customers to look for alternative sources of supply and has left our customers without a supply, both of which events have harmed our reputation and made it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers. If this inability to increase production continues or worsens, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. In periods of weaker demand, such as the recent environment in 2020, we have been, and may in the future be, required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase inventories or manufacture products that we are unable to sell. The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate, to introduce new products in a timely manner, and to manage transitions to new product innovations effectively. Technology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers’ requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Our research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may also introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may not manage the transition from older products effectively to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. New products may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, may have higher costs than initially estimated, may contain defects or perceived defects or have 16 reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems. There have been, and may continue to be, difficulties in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful as we cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. Failure to develop and introduce new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could impede our revenue growth, lead to loss of market share, and negatively affect our results of operations and our competitiveness in the market. Customer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Changes in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include: • fluctuations in our customers’ businesses; • decisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products; • timing and recognition of revenues from customer orders; • timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors; • availability and pricing of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors; • changes in the prices of our products or of our competitors’ products; and • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We received in the past, and may receive in the future, several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers’ businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods. Delays in shipments near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period. In addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. As a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our or our third-party providers’ information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems, software and services (collectively, “IT Systems”) for internal and external operations. We operate some of these IT Systems ourselves and also rely on IT Systems provided by third parties to run our business, including to interact with our employees and our customers and suppliers. These interactions include, but are not limited to, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. We do not control our third-party service providers and we do not maintain redundant systems for some of such services, increasing our vulnerability to problems with such services. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we and our third-party service providers collect, process and maintain confidential business information as well as personal information. Like other global companies, there are constant cyber related threats and risks to our IT Systems and data, including by internal and external perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software (for example, ransomware) and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions. Certain other events could also result in the disruption of our IT Systems, including power outages, catastrophes, hardware and software bugs, misconfigurations or failures, and other unforeseen events. We expect the frequency and magnitude of cyberattacks to accelerate as attackers are becoming more sophisticated, for example, by using techniques designed to 17 circumvent controls, avoid detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, such that we may be unable to timely or effectively detect, identify, investigate or remediate attacks in the future. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in IT Systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our IT Systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential business or personal information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, suppliers or other business partners, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, or other liabilities that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our IT Systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security of our IT Systems, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Our insurance policies may or may not cover various cybersecurity risks and liabilities, and even if coverage exists, there can be no guarantee that any or all costs or losses incurred would be partially or fully insured. Actual or perceived failures to comply with applicable data protection, privacy and security laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements may adversely impact our business and financial results. Legislation in various countries around the world with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection is rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) has caused more stringent data protection requirements in the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects how their personal data is to be used; imposes limitations on retention of personal data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we have business operations or are otherwise subject to the GDPR. Certain breaches of the GDPR requirements could result in substantial fines, which can be up to four percent of worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well as potential civil claims, including class action type litigation where individuals suffered harm. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the EU and the United States remains uncertain. For example, in 2016, the EU and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the EU to the United States, called the Privacy Shield. However, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”) limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EU/EEA to the United States by invalidating the Privacy Shield for purposes of international transfers and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield). These restrictions include a requirement for companies to carry out a transfer impact assessment which, among other things, assesses the laws governing access to personal data in the recipient country and considers whether supplementary measures that provide privacy protections additional to those provided under SCCs will need to be implemented to ensure an essentially equivalent level of data protection to that afforded in the EEA. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021 and existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU and the expiration of the transition period, since January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global revenue. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/extends that decision. In the United States, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was recently 18 enacted in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt - outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Any liability from our failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our GDPR and CCPA compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts in general. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR, CCPA or other applicable regimes. Changes in foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds or Japanese Yen, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors. Additionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposures, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency rate fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks. Our reliance on international operations subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 62% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including: • foreign exchange rate fluctuations; • increases in shipping costs; • longer customer payment cycles; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • use of incompatible systems and equipment; • problems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures; • trade tariffs, trade barriers and export/import controls; • transportation delays and interruptions; • increased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights; • government currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings; • compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including those that potentially conflict with other jurisdictions; • the impact of recessionary foreign economies; • political unrest and wars, such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia, which could delay or disrupt our business, and if such political unrest escalates or spills over to or otherwise impacts additional regions, it could heighten many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A; and • natural disasters, health epidemics and acts of terrorism. We also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such 19 violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct , which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws. Increased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the U.S. leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business. We are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China, Southeast Asia and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries, increased frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters as a result of global warming, and public health crises could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products, or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property. Increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our sales channels and supply chain in the international marketplace make us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we sell, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and some other countries, have escalated in recent years. For example, U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports in recent years were followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are or were subject to these tariffs, which have increased our manufacturing costs and have made our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been and may in the future be subject to retaliatory tariffs in China, which increase our costs and make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. If heightened tariffs were to be imposed in the future, we may not be able to mitigate their impacts, and our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain other foreign markets could also become subject to retaliatory tariffs, making our products uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of our common shares. We are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations in the U.K., Germany and China. The U.K. formally exited the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, on January 31, 2020. On December 30, 2020, the U.K. and EU signed the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”), which includes an agreement on free trade between the two parties and went into effect on May 1, 2021.While agreement on the terms of the TCA has avoided a “no deal” Brexit scenario and provides for, in principle, quota and tariff-free trading of goods, it is nevertheless expected that the TCA will result in the creation of non-tariff barriers (such as increased shipping and regulatory costs and complexities) to the trade in goods between the UK and the EU. Further, the TCA does not provide for the continued free movement of services between the UK and the EU and imposes additional restrictions on the free movement of people between the UK and the EU. The TCA also grants to each of the UK and the EU the ability, in certain circumstances, to unilaterally impose tariffs on one another. In the event of such an imposition, any additional tariffs may have a material adverse impact on us as well as the stability of UK-EU trade more generally. Any uncertainty as to UK or EU government policies and, in particular, whether any such policy may result in the imposition of reciprocal tariffs, may depress economic activity or have an adverse impact on our business and operations. It remains to be seen whether the initial implementation of, and adjustment of UK-EU trading processes for, the TCA could increase our costs or otherwise negatively impact sales of our products, mobility of our personnel and our access to capital. Others may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights. Our future success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies 20 similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any application s filed by us, or that the claims allowed, even if patents are issued, will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources . Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors. Our operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties. We have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. We could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement. We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences. Some of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses as planned. As part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc., Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc., ARGES GmbH, Med X Change, Inc., and Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management’s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. Further, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate newly acquired operations into our existing businesses. We may fail to identify inherent weaknesses in acquired businesses or misinterpret market and technology trends and growth potentials during our acquisition due diligence process. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investments, our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 21 If we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. We have recently experienced increased turnover of key personnel, and the competition for skilled employees is intense. We have incurred increased expenses in connection with the retention of existing key personnel and hiring of new employees, and we expect these increased costs to continue. Additional losses of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us if the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. The costs to retain or hire employees could also increase more than we expect. Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses and improve gross margin is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize the expected cost savings and gross margin improvements. We are taking, and may need to take in the future, additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. We are also taking actions to improve our price realization, reduce our overhead and cost of poor quality, and improve our material productivity. Failure to successfully implement these actions could negatively impact our ability to achieve our gross margin goals. Product defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors’ products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation. We produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors’ products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, have adversely affected the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or a single source of supply. Certain single source suppliers of key components for us have decided to stop producing some of these components. If we fail to find alternative sources, redesign our products or otherwise manage this transition effectively, our business would be adversely impacted. If additional single source suppliers decide to stop producing a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is otherwise delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such decisions or delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our business could be adversely affected. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders. In addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the 22 price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders. If we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on multiple factors, including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers. Production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. We have recently experienced factory disruptions at certain of our U.K. and China facilities. If our production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were again disrupted, including by mandatory power consumption reductions, natural disasters or other weather events, health epidemics, acts of terrorism or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could also be the result of: • mistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations; • changing process technologies; • ramping production; • installing new equipment at our manufacturing facilities; • implementing new information technology systems; • shortage of key components; and • loss of electricity or employees’ access to the manufacturing facilities due to man-made and natural disasters. From time to time, we make decisions to consolidate or move certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility, including the ongoing move of our air bearing spindles manufacturing from one of our U.K. sites to our facility in China and the ongoing move of our beryllium mirror manufacturing operation to a new facility within the U.K. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping and customs delays, travel and technology restrictions, tax issues, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the key package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers. We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulations, which may impede or hinder the approval, certification or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval or certification of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved or certified products. Some of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive 23 FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, medical devices must comply with the EU Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation (EU) No 2017/745). To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements, medical devices must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its risk classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the general safety and performance requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility, metrology or reuse aspects), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (“CE”) mark to medical devices, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in the EU. The process of obtaining marketing approval, certification or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could: • take a significant period of time; • require substantial resources; • involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; • require changes to products; and • result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved or certified in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals or certification for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval or certification will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review, inspection and audit of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA and other regulatory agencies worldwide can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Similar requirements apply in foreign jurisdictions. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances, approvals or certifications, and could result in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future changes. For instance, the landscape concerning medical devices in the EU recently evolved. On May 25, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation entered into force, which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The Medical Devices Regulation is intended to establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices. These modifications may have an effect on the way we intend to develop our business in the EU and EEA. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs, lengthen regulatory review time for, or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of our products. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or 24 approval, changes to manufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products, or require additional record keeping. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, approvals or certification, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance or certification on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances or certifications, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval or certification by the FDA or other comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and operations are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties. Our products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sale, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include: • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to be deemed to have committed a violation; • federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act; • the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to be deemed to have committed a violation; • HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; • the federal physician “Sunshine Act” requirements, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (the “CMS”) information related to (i) payments and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute), certain other healthcare providers (beginning in 2022), and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; • state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as (i) anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; (ii) state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restricted payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; (iii) laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and (iv) laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Efforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 25 Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products. Several of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurs, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting both in the U.S. and internationally could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. Various elements of healthcare reforms, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may have material adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on centralized information systems to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We often need to upgrade our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new or upgrading existing enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become proficient in the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of new or upgraded ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had $700.5 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets. 26 Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reliance upon OEM customers subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control. Our sales depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, customers, and governments with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") policies and practices may cause us to incur additional costs or expose us to additional risks. There has been increasing public focus and scrutiny from investors, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and customers on corporate ESG practices. We are making efforts to respond to public expectations and to demonstrate our commitment to sustainability and sound ESG policies and practices. However, our ESG practices may not meet the standards of all of our stakeholders and advocacy groups may campaign for further changes. Many of our large, global customers are also committing to long-term targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within their supply chains. If we are unable to support customers in achieving these reductions, we may lose revenue if our customers find other suppliers who are better able to support such reductions. A failure, or perceived failure, to respond to expectations of all parties could cause harm to our business and reputation and have a negative impact on the market price of our common shares. New government regulations could also result in new environmental regulations and new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may lead to increased expenditures for sustainability initiatives. In addition, concern over climate change and sustainability has led to foreign and domestic legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. We may experience increased costs in order to execute upon our sustainability goals and comply with future climate-change related government mandates as well as environmental protection laws, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability. Risks Relating to Taxes Novanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation. Novanta Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends, royalties and certain types of interest. Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure We may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, the need to invest in cloud-based enterprise resource planning systems and other digital technology platforms to help accelerate the growth of our businesses, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding debt of $438.6 million under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and $348.4 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on 27 terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares. Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had $438.6 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: • reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, changes in the general economic environment, and market changes in the industries in which we operate; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended, contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder. General Risk Factors The market price for our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by: • quarterly variations in our results of operations; • changes in earnings estimates by analysts; • conditions in the markets we serve; • trading phenomena such as “short squeeze”; or • general market, political or economic conditions. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions with varying tax rates, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, and/or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers’ failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition. 28 If we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business. While our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common shares. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. Item 1B.

These facilities are used by our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases or in finding alternative facilities. We believe all our properties have been properly maintained. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. See Note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about legal proceedings involving the Company. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 30 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Shares, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information The Company’s common shares, no par value, are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “NOVT”. Holders As of the close of business on February 21, 2022, there were approximately 32 holders of record of the Company’s common shares. Since many of the common shares are registered in “nominee” or “street” names, the Company believes that the total number of beneficial owners is considerably higher. Dividend Policy The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchaser In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of up to $25.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), authorizing the repurchase of up to an additional $50.0 million worth of the Company’s common shares. While these share repurchase plans are intended to generally offset dilutions from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, we are not obligated to acquire any particular amount of our common shares. No time limit was set for the completion of these share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $59.5 million available for future share repurchases under these share repurchase plans. The Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. 31 Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on the Company’s common shares with the cumulative total return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index for the period from December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2021. The comparison assumes an investment of $100 was made on December 31, 2016 in the Company’s common shares and in each of the indices and, in the case of the indices, it also assumes reinvestment of all dividends. The performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our financial results and our financial condition; our belief that the Purchasing Managers Index (“PMI”) may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market; our strategy; anticipated financial performance; expected liquidity and capitalization; drivers of revenue growth and our growth expectations in various markets; management’s plans and objectives for future operations, expenditures and product development, and investments in research and development; business prospects; potential of future product releases and expansion of our product and service offerings; anticipated revenue performance; industry trends; market conditions; our competitive positions; changes in economic and political conditions, including supply chain disruptions and constraints and inflationary pressures; changes in accounting principles; changes in actual or assumed tax liabilities; expectations regarding tax exposures; anticipated reinvestment of future earnings and dividend policy; anticipated expenditures in regard to the Company’s benefit plans; future acquisitions and integration and anticipated benefits from acquisitions and dispositions; anticipated economic benefits and expected costs of restructuring programs; ability to repay our indebtedness; our intentions regarding the use of cash; expectations regarding legal and regulatory requirements, including environmental requirements, and our compliance thereto; and other statements that are not historical facts. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” “estimates,” “plans,” “could,” “would,” “should,” “potential,” “continues,” and similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) identify forward looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Management and the Company disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in its expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward looking statements, except as required under applicable law. Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2021, the medical market accounted for approximately 52% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2021, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 48% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 34 Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, intelligent end-of-arm robotic technology solutions, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites, and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Acquisition of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. On August 30, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for an upfront cash purchase price of $169.2 million, net of cash acquired and estimated working capital adjustments, and $44.0 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022 based on a multiple of the standalone ATI Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. We expect that the addition of ATI will complement and add intelligent technology solutions to further expand our position in mission critical robotic applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Acquisition of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. On August 31, 2021, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated motion control solutions and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total cash purchase price of $114.7 million, inclusive of post-closing working capital adjustments and net of cash acquired. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of SEM will complement and expand our presence in life science applications and solutions for industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our major facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities and have adapted our COVID-19 safety measures as the pandemic and related government mandates evolved over the past two years. We expect to continue some of these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for 35 purposes of our business. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investments in technologies and monitoring equipment , weekly testing of unvaccinated employees for COVID-19 at certain locations and rearranging some of our facilities to accommodate social distancing and flexible post-pandemic work environment . Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully, reopen, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with COVID-19 may continue to affect our business for the foreseeable future. Through December 31, 2021, we have experienced disruptions to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and global electronics and other raw material shortages. While we regularly monitor the manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain, disruptions to our suppliers and/or sub-suppliers caused by these events could further challenge our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and customer relationships. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages, we are identifying alternative suppliers and distributors, sourcing raw materials from different supplier and distributor locations, modifying our product designs to allow for alternative components to be used where feasible without compromising quality, performance or other requirements, in-sourcing production of parts where feasible, and taking other actions to ensure a sustainable supply of raw materials. Despite of our mitigation actions, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key part or component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and backlogs, and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the global electronics and other raw material shortages have caused inflationary pressures on the market prices for certain of our parts and primary raw materials as well as increases in the costs of labor, freight, packaging, energy and other consumables that are used in our manufacturing processes. We have generally been able to offset increases in these costs through various productivity and cost reduction initiatives, as well as adjusting our selling prices to pass through some of these higher costs to our customers; however, our ability to raise our selling prices depends on market conditions and competitive dynamics. Given the timing of our actions compared to the timing of these inflationary pressures, there may be periods during which we are unable to fully recover the increases in our costs. Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for 2021 was $706.8 million, an increase of $116.2 million, or 19.7%, versus 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial market related to microelectronics and increases in industrial manufacturing spending as compared to 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19, as well as revenue from current year acquisitions. The effect of our current year acquisitions resulted in an increase in revenue of $43.2 million, or 7.3%. In addition, foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $12.5 million, or 2.1%, in 2021. Operating income for 2021 was $64.1 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 14.6%, versus 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $55.8 million mostly attributable to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses of $11.5 million, selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $19.3 million and restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $14.2 million. Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $1.42 in 2021 increased $0.15 from the basic EPS of $1.27 in 2020. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $1.41 in 2021 increased $0.16 from the diluted EPS of $1.25 in 2020. The increase of basic EPS and diluted EPS was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income offset by the increase of income tax provision. Specific components of our operating results for 2021 and 2020 are further discussed below. Results of Operations Information pertaining to fiscal year 2019 results of operations, including a year-over-year comparison with fiscal year 2020, was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021. 36 The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated: 2021 2020 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 57.5 58.6 Gross profit 42.5 41.4 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 10.3 10.3 Selling, general and administrative 18.3 18.6 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.3 2.4 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 2.5 0.6 Total operating expenses 33.4 31.9 Operating income 9.1 9.5 Interest income (expense), net (1.0 ) (1.1 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (0.0 ) (0.2 ) Other income (expense), net (0.1 ) 0.0 Income before income taxes 7.9 8.2 Income tax provision 0.8 0.7 Consolidated net income 7.1 % 7.5 % Revenue The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Photonics $ 232,459 $ 199,613 16.5 % Vision 262,060 261,650 0.2 % Precision Motion 212,274 129,360 64.1 % Total $ 706,793 $ 590,623 19.7 % Photonics Photonics segment revenue in 2021 increased by $32.8 million, or 16.5%, versus 2020, primarily due to increased demand in the advanced industrial market as a result of increases in industrial manufacturing spending as compared to 2020, which was impacted by COVID-19 pandemic. Vision Vision segment revenue in 2021 increased by $0.4 million, or 0.2%, versus 2020, primarily flat due to consistent customer demand dynamics from our minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) products as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue in 2021 increased by $82.9 million, or 64.1%, versus 2020, primarily due to an increase in demand in advanced industrial market and certain medical robotic applications as well as an aggregate of $43.2 million revenue contributions from the ATI and SEM acquisitions. 37 Gross Profit The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): 2021 2020 Gross profit: Photonics $ 107,993 $ 89,060 Vision 100,890 100,267 Precision Motion 99,345 58,279 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (7,900 ) (3,089 ) Total $ 300,328 $ 244,517 Gross profit margin: Photonics 46.5 % 44.6 % Vision 38.5 % 38.3 % Precision Motion 46.8 % 45.1 % Total 42.5 % 41.4 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for 2021 increased $18.9 million, or 21.3%, versus 2020, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 46.5% for 2021, versus a gross profit margin of 44.6% for 2020. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher factory utilization associated with higher production volumes. Vision Vision segment gross profit for 2021 increased $0.6 million, or 0.6%, versus 2020, primarily flat due to consistent customer demand dynamics from our MIS products as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vision segment gross profit margin was 38.5% for 2021, compared with a gross profit margin of 38.3% for 2020. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for 2021 increased $41.1 million, or 70.5%, versus 2020, primarily due to an increase in both revenue and gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 46.8% for 2021, compared with a gross profit margin of 45.1% for 2020. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to higher factory utilization associated with higher production volumes and favorable year over year comparison due to higher inventory obsolescence in the prior year, offset by higher purchased intangible asset amortization of $2.5 million and an increase in the amortization of acquisition inventory fair value adjustments of $1.4 million. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2021 2020 2021 vs. 2020 Research and development and engineering $ 72,522 $ 60,996 18.9 % Selling, general and administrative 129,155 109,853 17.6 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 16,577 13,970 18.7 % Restructuring and acquisition related costs 18,020 3,810 373.0 % Total $ 236,274 $ 188,629 25.3 % 38 Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $72.5 million, or 10.3% of revenue, in 2021, versus $61.0 million, or 10.3% of revenue, in 2020. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to higher compensation related expenses and R&D expenses from acquisitions. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management. SG&A expenses were $129.2 million, or 18.3% of revenue, in 2021, versus $109.9 million, or 18.6% of revenue, in 2020. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to the re-establishment of employee bonus plans in 2021 and other compensation related increases, and SG&A expenses from acquisitions. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of developed technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, trade names, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $16.6 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2021, versus $14.0 million, or 2.4% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in terms of total dollars was the result of more acquired intangible assets from current year acquisitions. Restructuring, Acquisition, and Related Costs Restructuring, acquisition, and related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $18.0 million in 2021, versus $3.8 million in 2020. The increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs versus the prior year was primarily due to an increase in acquisition related professional service fees of $5.4 million, acquisition related contingent consideration increase of $4.9 million primarily as result of a reduction in the fair value of contingent considerations in 2020, and restructuring costs of $3.9 million primarily related to the 2020 restructuring plan. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): 2021 2020 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 46,792 $ 34,001 Vision 17,694 16,354 Precision Motion 52,676 31,663 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (53,108 ) (26,130 ) Total $ 64,054 $ 55,888 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $46.8 million, or 20.1% of revenue, in 2021, versus $34.0 million, or 17.0% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $18.9 million, partially offset by increases in R&D spending of $2.2 million and restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $4.7 million. 39 Vision Vision segment operating income was $17.7 million, or 6.8% of revenue, in 2021, versus $16.4 million, or 6.3% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $0.6 million, a decrease in SG&A expenses of $1.7 million, and a decrease in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $1.4 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $2.6 million. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $52.7 million, or 24.8% of revenue, in 2021, versus $31.7 million, or 24.5% of revenue, in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $41.1 million, partially offset by an increase in restructuring, acquisition, and related charges of $5.8 million, R&D spending of $6.8 million, SG&A expense of $5.2 million and amortization of purchased intangible assets expense of $2.3 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared SG&A functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2021 increased by $27.0 million, or 103.2%, from 2020, primarily due to an increase in SG&A spending of $17.1 million mostly related to the re-establishment of employee bonus plans in 2021 and other compensation related increases, an increase in acquisition related costs of $5.3 million and an increase in costs related to COVID-19 testing for employees of $3.3 million included in cost of revenue. Interest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2021 and 2020 (in thousands): 2021 2020 Interest income (expense), net $ (7,387 ) $ (6,564 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net $ (127 ) $ (942 ) Other income (expense), net $ (368 ) $ 21 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $7.4 million in 2021 versus $6.6 million in 2020. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.16% and 2.32% during 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.2 million and $1.0 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.1 million of net losses in 2021 versus $0.9 million of net losses in 2020, primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal in both 2021 and 2020. Income Tax Provision We recorded a tax provision of $5.8 million in 2021, compared to a tax provision of $3.9 million in 2020. The effective tax rate for 2021 was 10.4% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 8.0% of income before income taxes for 2020. Our effective tax rate for 2021 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, $2.6 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, $5.1 million benefit from share-based compensation, $1.4 million benefit from R&D and other tax credits, and $1.2 million benefit for foreign derived intangible income, 40 partially offset by $1.1 million detriment related to disallowed compensation, and a $0.9 million detriment on the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions . Our effective tax rate for 2020 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, $1.3 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, $2.3 million benefit from share-based compensation, $0.7 million release of a portion of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in Canada, $2.0 million of R&D and other tax credits, $1.1 million of estimated deductions for foreign derived intangible income, and $1.5 million benefit from the reduction in fair value of non-deductible acquisition contingent consideration liabilities, offset by miscellaneous other items such as foreign withholding taxes and impact of changes in statutory tax rates on our deferred tax attributes. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our income taxes or related disclosures. Net Income The consolidated net income was $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $44.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the impact of the factors described above. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for any future capital expenditures and other liquidity needs. In addition, we have the ability to expand our borrowing capacity by up to $200.0 million by exercising the accordion feature under our revolving credit agreement. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or preferred or common equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. There is no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms or at all. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening supply chain disruptions and electronics and other material shortages, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of December 31, 2021, $77.3 million of our $117.4 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of North America. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our senior credit facilities. Approximately $164.6 million of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of North America as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs from various subsidiaries. We deferred $2.8 million of U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. We paid $1.4 million of such deferred payroll tax payments during 2021. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay the remaining $1.4 million deferred U.S. payroll taxes by December 31, 2022. In May 2021, our shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. Our Board of Directors may designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares in order to raise additional capital, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share. As of December 31, 2021, no preferred shares were issued and outstanding. 41 Share Repurchase P lan s Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2021. No Shares were purchased under the 2018 Repurchase Plan during the year ended December 31, 2021. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares, effective after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase plan to date. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at anytime until maturity. On March 27, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On June 2, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment revised our consolidated leverage ratio definition (as defined in the Third amended and Restated Credit Agreement) allowing for the use of up to $25 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as a reduction to consolidated funded indebtedness (as defined in the Third amended and Restated Credit Agreement). On October 5, 2021, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to exercise the accordion feature. The Fourth Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $200.0 million, from $495.0 million to $695.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. As of December 31, 2021, we had $92.0 (€81.1) million term loan and $346.6 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% to 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $164.6 million and $274.0 million, respectively. 42 The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that , we believe , are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 20 2 1 : Requirement Actual December 31, 2021 Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 2.48 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 12.20 In addition, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents totaled $117.4 million at December 31, 2021, versus $125.1 million at December 31, 2020. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions of $284.7 million (net of cash acquired of $14.6 million), $32.4 million of debt repayments, $30.8 million of employee payroll withholding tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $20.0 million capital expenditures, and $8.7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement. These cash outflows were partially offset by borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $280.0 million used to fund the cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions and cash provided by operating activities of $94.6 million. The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands): 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 117,393 $ 125,054 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 94,625 $ 140,239 Net cash used in investing activities $ (306,704 ) $ (13,156 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 204,753 $ (84,357 ) Unused borrowing capacity available under revolving credit facility, end of year $ 348,421 $ 395,239 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $94.6 million in 2021, versus $140.2 million in 2020. Cash provided by operating activities decreased from the prior year primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and inventories due to increases in revenue and demand, and an $8.3 million payment in accordance with an acquisition earnout arrangement that was recorded as compensation, partially offset by an increase in days payables outstanding and substantially no bonus payout in 2021 as a result of the elimination of our 2020 annual employee cash bonus plan which was replaced with a special one-time restricted stock unit grant to employees in April 2020. Cash provided by operating activities for 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.7 at December 31, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 45 days at December 31, 2020. During 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee cash bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $306.7 million in 2021, primarily driven by the ATI and SEM acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid cash considerations of $284.7 million (net of cash acquired of $14.6 million). We also paid capital expenditures of $20.0 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.2 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. Cash used in investing activities was $13.2 million in 2020, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $10.5 million and a contingent consideration payment of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. 43 We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2021. We expect to use approximately $ 25 million to $ 30 million in 20 2 2 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash provided by financing activities was $204.8 million in 2021, primarily due to $280.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund the cash considerations paid for the ATI and SEM acquisitions, partially offset by $32.4 million of term loan and revolving credit facility repayments, $30.8 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, an $8.7 million payment for the purchase of a building under a finance lease agreement, and $1.8 million of contingent consideration payments related to prior year acquisitions. Cash used in financing activities was $84.4 million in 2020, primarily due to $35.4 million in repayments of borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $31.0 million payments of deferred and escrowed purchase price related to prior year acquisitions, $8.6 million of employee payroll withholding tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. In 2022, we are contractually required to make $5.1 million in repayments under our term loan facility. In addition, we may make optional repayments under our term loan and revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities. Pension Plans We maintain a defined benefit pension plan (the “U.K. Plan”) in Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the participants’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan. Our funding policy is to fund the U.K. Plan based on actuarial methods as permitted by the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used, such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality rates, retail price inflation and other market driven assumptions. Each assumption used represents one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known, including actual return on plan assets and pension payments to plan participants. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan by $2.8 million. Based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, our annual funding contributions are expected to be approximately $1.1 million in 2022 and will increase by 2.9% per year until the next statutory funding valuation date in 2024. Material Cash Requirements Senior Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2021, we had $92.0 million (€81.1 million) term loan and $346.6 million revolving credit facility borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of approximately €1.1 million ($1.3 million) with the final installment of €68.7 million ($77.9 million) due upon maturity in December 2024. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity in December 2024. As of December 31, 2021, the future interest payments under our Senior Credit Facilities are expected to be approximately $33.2 million, with $11.5 million payable within the next twelve months. These estimates are based on current interest rates on floating rate obligations, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, for the remainder of the contractual life of both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, and the current commitment fee rate was used for the unused commitments under revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11, “Debt,” in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details of our debt obligations and the timing of expected future payments. Operating and Finance Leases We entered into various lease agreements for office and manufacturing facilities, vehicles, and equipment used in the normal course of business. Undiscounted operating and finance lease obligations were $74.3 million, with $10.1 million payable within 12 44 months. See Note 12, “Leases,” in the Consolidated Financial Statement s for further details of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2021, we had $169.6 million of purchase obligations, with $167.1 million payable within the next twelve months. Contingent Consideration and Earn-outs As of December 31, 2021, total estimated payments for contingent considerations and earn-outs accrued for in the consolidated balance sheet amounted to $50.9 million, with $47.5 million estimated payments due within the next twelve months. See Note 7, “Fair Value Measurements”, in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the fair values of our obligations under the contingent consideration and earn-out arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, valuation of contingent consideration obligations, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. Under ASC 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606 includes the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. We occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. 45 We generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 36 months . The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of the costs to service warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue. We expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. Inventories . Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, customs duties and trade tariffs on imported materials and components, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, storage, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or trailing historical usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our operating income. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher operating income than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. In addition to service-based awards granted to a wider employee base, we typically grant three types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”), operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”), and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the vesting period of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. For EPS-PSUs and OCF-PSUs, share-based compensation expenses are recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections as of the end of each period. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the estimated probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the levels of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expenses associated with EPS-PSUs and OCF-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, share-based compensation expenses are recognized based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. Shared-based compensation expenses related to TSR-PSUs are recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years, regardless of whether the target relative total shareholder return is achieved. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement in a large number of simulated scenarios. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model include risk-free interest rate and expected stock price volatility of both the Company’s common shares and the Russell 2000 index. Valuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Key assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and projected cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, technology obsolescence curves, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the estimated useful life assumptions for identifiable intangible assets, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if 46 changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. We evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit levels which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit as of the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. The DCF method requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit’s operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Factors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following: • significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; • changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; • long-term negative industry or economic trends; • technological changes or developments; • changes in competition; • loss of key customers or personnel; • adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; • significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and • the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. 47 The occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified. The most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2021, using a quantitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 2021, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Goodwill Intangible Assets, net Property, Plant & Equipment, net Photonics $ 112,103 $ 51,346 $ 38,102 Vision 128,953 51,992 29,942 Precision Motion 238,444 117,651 16,079 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services — — 3,316 Total $ 479,500 $ 220,989 $ 87,439 Contingent Considerations and Earnouts. We record contingent considerations and earnouts resulting from business combinations at fair value as of the acquisition date. Key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of our contingent considerations include the following: • future revenue projections and earnings before interest, depreciation, amortization and other agreed-upon adjustments as specified in the purchase and sale agreement (“Adjusted EBITDA”); • volatility of future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA; and • discount rates used to present value the projected cash flows. On a quarterly basis, we reassess these assumptions and record the necessary adjustments to fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes to contingent consideration obligations can result from adjustments to future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA projections, volatility of future revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, and discount rates. The assumptions used for the determination of the fair value of contingent considerations involve significant judgment, and changes in the underlying assumptions could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Accounting for Income Taxes . As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for income tax return and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period in which such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made. In conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance of $0.9 48 million on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income (losses) generated in both the current and future year s . The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcomes related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2021, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $4.8 million, of which $4.6 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate, if benefited. Over the next twelve months, we may need to reverse up to $0.5 million of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount recognized for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. The excess amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $266.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liabilities on this temporary difference is approximately $4.0 million. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to product quality, labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statements. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have a significant effect on us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We address market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect our operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposures are the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuan. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and with intercompany trading partners that are eliminated in consolidation. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign currency contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecasted transactions. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency contracts that hedge these exposures. We had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling $50.0 million and net fair value of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2021. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $0.6 million increase in the net fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2021. By contrast, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $0.6 million decrease in the net fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2021. 49 Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. We had $438.6 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2021. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2021 would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $4.4 million. 50 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOVANTA INC. INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm – PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 52 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 55 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2 019 56 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2 019 57 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2 019 58 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2 019 59 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 60 51 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Novanta Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. As described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”) and Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded ATI and SEM from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. ATI and SEM are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 5% and 1% of total assets, respectively and approximately 5% and 1% of total revenues, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding 52 prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Acquisitions of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. and Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. – Valuation of Developed Technologies and Customer Relationships Intangible Assets As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisitions of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (ATI) and Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (SEM) in 2021. The acquisition of ATI resulted in a $23.9 million customer relationships intangible asset and a $19.8 million developed technologies intangible asset being recorded, and the acquisition of SEM resulted in a $41.7 million customer relationships intangible asset and a $9.1 million developed technologies intangible asset being recorded. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded by management at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for developed technologies. The process for estimating the fair values of these identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions by management, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates, technology obsolescence curves, and EBITDA margins. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets acquired in the ATI and SEM acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the developed technologies and customer relationships assets, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, discount rates, and technology obsolescence curves used in the valuation of the developed technologies intangible assets and the revenue growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and EBITDA margins used in the valuation of the customer relationships intangible assets, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s (i) valuation of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets and (ii) development of significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates, technology obsolescence curves and EBITDA margins. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements and (ii) testing management’s process for determining the fair value of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates, royalty rates, discount rates, and technology obsolescence curves used in the valuation of the developed technologies intangible assets and the revenue growth rates, discount rates, customer attrition rates, and EBITDA margins used in the valuation of the customer relationships intangible assets. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates in the valuation of developed technologies and revenue growth rates, EBITDA margins, and customer attrition rates used in the valuation of the customer relationships involved considering the past performance of the acquired businesses, consistency with economic and industry forecasts, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the valuation methods and of the reasonableness of the royalty rates, discount rates, and technology obsolescence curves in the valuation of the developed technologies intangible assets and the customer attrition rates and discount rates used in the valuation of the customer relationships intangible assets. 53 Fair Value of the Contingent Consideration for ARGES GmbH Acquisition As described in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $3.8 million of a contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2021 related to the 2019 acquisition of ARGES GmbH. The contingent consideration payments are payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. Management determines the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability using a Monte Carlo valuation method. The unobservable inputs used by management to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability included historical and projected revenues, revenue volatility, cost of debt, and the discount rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of the contingent consideration for the ARGES GmbH acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the Monte Carlo valuation method and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the projected revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rate, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s valuation of the contingent consideration, including controls over management’s valuation method and significant assumptions related to projected revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rate. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for determining the fair value of the contingent consideration, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo valuation method, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used by management, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the projected revenues, revenue volatility, and discount rate. Evaluating the assumptions related to projected revenues involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering the current and past performance of the acquired business, consistency with external market data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s Monte Carlo valuation method and the revenue volatility and discount rate assumptions. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 1, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. 54 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., applied on a consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which such revisions are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses. The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of its products. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay by conducting a credit review which includes consideration of established credit rating or an internal assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness based on an analysis of their payment history when a credit rating is not available. The Company monitors its credit exposure through active review of customer balances. The Company’s expected loss methodology for accounts receivable is developed through consideration of factors including, but not limit to, historical collection experience, current customer credit ratings, current customer financial condition, current and future economic and market condition, and age of the receivables. Charges related to credit losses are included as selling, general and administrative expenses and are recorded in the period that the outstanding receivables are determined to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is certain that the receivable will not be recovered. 60 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands): 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $ 274 $ 297 $ 321 Addition to credit loss expense 121 158 33 Credit loss resulting from acquisitions 216 — 120 Write-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 45 ) ( 207 ) ( 179 ) Exchange rate changes ( 10 ) 26 2 Balance at end of year $ 556 $ 274 $ 297 Inventories Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight and duties, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, storage, disposal and transportation. The Company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product. The Company records a charge to cost of revenue for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation of its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from 10 to 30 years for buildings and building improvements, and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the lease terms, including any renewal period options that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Certain costs to develop software for internal use are capitalized when the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” are met. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities acquired in a business combination. Allocations of the purchase price are based upon a valuation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure their current fair values exceed their carrying values. The Company’s most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The fair values of intangible assets are based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of the acquired companies and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews the useful life assumptions, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Costs associated with patent and intellectual property applications, renewals or extensions are typically expensed as incurred. The Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is at least one level below the reportable segments. Impairment Charges Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —Goodwill and Other.” The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. 61 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method with a weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the second quarter, and more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company will also reassess the continuing classification of these intangible assets as indefinite-lived when circumstances change such that the useful life may no longer be considered indefinite. The fair values of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using the relief from royalty method, based on forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The carrying amounts of definite-lived long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value is generally determined by comparison of the carrying value of the asset group to its undiscounted future cash flows. When this test indicates a potential for impairment, a fair value assessment is performed. Once an impairment is determined and measured, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Revenue Recognition See Note 3 for the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are included in current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of the Company’s lease arrangements include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. Upon adoption of ASC 842, “Leases”, the Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. Research and Development and Engineering Costs Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. These costs are expensed as incurred. 62 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Share-Based Compensation The Company records expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the respective vesting periods, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company also grants three types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP earnings per share performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”), operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”), and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Share-based compensation expenses associated with EPS-PSUs and OCF-PSUs are recognized ratably over their vesting periods when it is probable that the performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the estimated levels of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be recorded in the period such determination is made. Accordingly, share-based compensation expenses associated with EPS-PSUs and OCF-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. Share-based compensation expenses associated with TSR-PSUs are based on the grant-date fair value, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model, and are recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expenses associated with TSR-PSUs will not be affected by the number of common shares that will ultimately be issued upon vesting at the end of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and were not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Restructuring, Acquisition and Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. Accounting for Income Taxes The asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the related tax benefits will not be realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released. The majority of the Company’s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of Canada. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. Consequently, the Company generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that the Company intends to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. 63 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses foreign currency contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The time duration of these foreign currency contracts approximates the underlying foreign currency transaction exposures, generally less than three months. These foreign currency contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, “Income Taxes”, including: (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 during the first quarter of 2021. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. 64 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2021-08 requires that entities recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. ASU 2021-08 also applies to contract assets or liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of ASC 606 apply. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 do not affect the accounting for other assets or liabilities that may arise from revenue contracts with customers in accordance with ASC 606, such as refund liabilities, or in a business combination, such as customer-related intangible assets and contract-based intangible assets. January 1, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2021-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 3. Revenue The Company accounts for its revenue transactions in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of control over goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. 65 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 36 months . The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated warranty cost is recorded in cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, contract liabilities were $ 7.3 million and $ 6.5 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquired contract liabilities of $ 2.0 million from current year acquisitions, partially offset by $ 5.6 million of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 18 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 4. Business Combinations 2021 Acquisitions On August 30, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ATI Industrial Automation, Inc. (“ATI”), an Apex, North Carolina-based leading supplier of intelligent end-of-arm technology solutions to OEMs for advanced industrial and surgical robots for an initial cash purchase price of $ 169.2 million, net of cash acquired and estimated working capital adjustments, and $ 44.0 million estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022 based on a multiple of the standalone ATI Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility and cash available on hand. The Company expects that the addition of ATI will complement and add intelligent technology solutions to further expand the Company’s position in mission critical robotic applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. On August 31, 2021 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc. (“SEM”), a Marlborough, Connecticut-based manufacturer of integrated motion control solutions and electronic controls for automation equipment for a total purchase price of $ 114.7 million, net of cash acquired and working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The Company expects that the addition of SEM will complement and expand the Company’s presence in life science applications and solutions for industrial automation applications within the Precision Motion reportable segment. 66 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Allocation of Purchase Price The acquisitions of ATI and SEM have been accounted for as business combinations. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated based upon a valuation of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and the relief-from-royalty method for developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates, technology obsolescence curves, and EBITDA margins. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill for each acquisition. The Company’s estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are subject to change within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date) as a result of additional information obtained with regards to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. ATI Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price, including measurement period adjustments, for ATI was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 10,709 Accounts receivable 12,596 Inventories 18,151 Property, plant and equipment 4,618 Operating lease assets 11,263 Intangible assets 52,800 Goodwill 134,420 Other assets 229 Total assets acquired 244,786 Accounts payable 5,135 Current portion of operating lease liabilities 1,740 Operating lease liabilities 9,525 Other liabilities 4,452 Total liabilities assumed 20,852 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 223,934 Less: cash acquired 10,709 Less: contingent consideration 44,000 Initial purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 169,225 Subsequent to the preliminary valuation, additional information that existed as of the acquisition date became available that resulted in adjustments to certain inputs used for the determination of estimated fair value of the contingent consideration. These changes resulted in a $ 7.9 million decrease to the liability and a $ 0.4 million increase to identifiable intangible assets. Adjustments to the preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in a decrease to goodwill of $ 8.3 million. As of December 31, 2021, the working capital adjustments had not been finalized and were estimated to be a cash receipt of $ 0.8 million. The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of inventories, other liabilities, contingent consideration and unrecognized tax benefits. 67 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The fair value of intangible assets for ATI is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 19,800 15 years Customer relationships 23,900 15 years Trademarks and trade names 5,600 15 years Backlog 3,500 1 year Total $ 52,800 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 52.8 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 134.4 million of goodwill. Goodwill amounting to $ 134.4 million is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) ATI’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) ATI’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ATI’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ATI were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on August 31, 2021. ATI contributed revenues of $ 34.0 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 3.4 million to the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021. ATI’s profit before income taxes for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 3.5 million. SEM Based upon a preliminary valuation, the total purchase price for SEM was allocated as follows (in thousands): Purchase Price Allocation Cash $ 3,881 Accounts receivable 4,240 Inventories 2,499 Property, plant and equipment 452 Intangible assets 54,570 Goodwill 68,291 Other assets 776 Total assets acquired 134,709 Accounts payable 1,325 Deferred tax liabilities 12,400 Other liabilities 2,420 Total liabilities assumed 16,145 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 118,564 Less: cash acquired 3,881 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 114,683 The purchase price allocation is preliminary as the Company is in the process of collecting additional information for the valuation of other liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. 68 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The fair value of intangible assets for SEM is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 9,110 15 years Customer relationships 41,740 20 years Trademarks and trade names 370 4 years Backlog 3,350 1 year Total $ 54,570 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 54.6 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 68.3 million of goodwill. As the SEM acquisition was structured as a stock acquisition for income tax purposes, the goodwill is no t expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) SEM’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) SEM’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of SEM’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of SEM were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on September 1, 2021. SEM contributed revenues of $ 9.1 million and a profit before income taxes of $ 0.3 million to the Company’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021. SEM’s profit before income taxes for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2021 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 1.8 million. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The pro forma information presented below includes the effects of business combination accounting resulting from the acquisitions of ATI and SEM, including amortization of inventory fair value adjustments, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on borrowings in connection with the acquisitions, acquisition costs, and the related tax effects, assuming that the acquisitions had been consummated as of January 1, 2020. The pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2020. Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Revenue $ 783,011 $ 682,626 Consolidated net income $ 52,420 $ 33,376 2019 Acquisitions On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.7 million ($ 73.2 million), including net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued at closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.8 million ($ 27.7 million) deferred cash consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration would be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from August 2019 through December 2026, with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. In 2020, the Company paid € 25.0 million to the former owner of ARGES for the deferred cash consideration and to settle working capital. The addition of ARGES complements and expands the Company’s existing portfolio of lasers and laser beam steering solutions capabilities within the Photonics reportable segment. On June 5, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs 69 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 in the medical market. The purchase price of $ 21.9 million, net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and a $ 21.0 million borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Med X Change complements and broadens the range of technology capabilities within the Company’s Vision reportable segment by providing its medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of € 14.3 million ($ 16.2 million), net of working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 8.5 million ($ 9.6 million) cash consideration and € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration would be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022, with the first payment due in the second quarter of 2020. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. The Ingenia purchase and sale agreement required € 0.8 million ($ 0.9 million) of the purchase price to be held back by the Company for indemnification of certain representations and warranties claims by the Company until the expiration of the holdback agreement in October 2020 . The Company released the indemnification holdback in the fourth quarter of 2020. The addition of Ingenia enhances the Company’s strategic position in precision motion control industry by enabling it to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. The acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change and Ingenia have been accounted for as business combinations. Purchase price allocation is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuation techniques with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. ARGES The final purchase price for ARGES was allocated as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,430 Inventories 7,129 Property, plant and equipment 14,095 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 42,951 Other assets 2,244 Total assets acquired 95,721 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 5,510 Other liabilities 14,462 Total liabilities assumed 22,570 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 73,151 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 69,992 Less: contingent consideration 7,870 Less: issuance of common shares 10,900 Less: deferred cash consideration 27,664 Initial cash purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 23,558 70 NOVANTA INC.

Developed technology and trademarks and trade names for ARGES were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 24.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 43.0 million of goodwill. As the ARGES acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) expected future benefits from advancing the Company’s photonic-based product roadmap through the addition of R&D capabilities from ARGES; (ii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (iii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iv) cost improvements due to the integration of ARGES’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ARGES were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 31, 2019. ARGES contributed revenues of $ 4.9 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and purchased intangible assets of $ 2.2 million.

Developed technology for Med X Change and Ingenia were valued using the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, respectively. Trademarks and trade names for both Med X Change and Ingenia were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company recorded an aggregate fair value of $ 22.4 million of identifiable intangible assets from the Med X Change and Ingenia acquisitions. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The Company recorded $ 13.4 million of goodwill from these acquisitions. Goodwill amounting to $ 6.2 million from the Med X Change acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill amounting to $ 7.2 million from the Ingenia acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) the ability of Med X Change and Ingenia to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) their ability to grow the businesses through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Med X Change and Ingenia operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of Med X Change and Ingenia were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions contributed revenues of $ 7.9 million and an income before income taxes of $ 0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and purchased intangible assets of $ 1.5 million. Acquisition Costs The Company recognized acquisition costs of $ 5.0 million, zero and $ 1.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the acquisitions that occurred during these years.

Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Contingent Considerations On August 30, 2021, the Company acquired ATI. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ATI acquisition, the former shareholders of ATI are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on ATI’s fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the purchase and sale agreement. The contingent consideration will be payable in 2022. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Once the fair value of the contingent consideration is finalized, subsequent changes in the estimated fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. The fair value of the contingent consideration was $ 44.0 million. On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. During 2020, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million). In March 2021, the Company made the first installment payment of € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million), which is included in cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021. During 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 3.3 million ($ 3.8 million). There were no other changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2021. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in three annual 75 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring, acquisition, and related costs until the liability is fully settled. The Company made the first installment payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) in May 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) in May 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash outflows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. During 2020 , the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million). During 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 1.5 million ($ 1.7 million). On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the former owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the assets acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. The Company made the first installment payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) in February 2020 and the second installment payment of € 1.8 million ($ 2.2 million) in February 2021. These installment payments are reported as cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the respective periods. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a current liability of € 1.2 million ($ 1.4 million) for the third and last installment payment, which is expected to be paid in March 2022.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of December 31, 2021, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 50.0 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.5 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively.

Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor of its pro rata share based on the adjusted net assets of each Guarantor. If at any time any payment of any of the obligations of the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, a Guarantor or otherwise, the Guarantees will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not been made. Each Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee and its obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) the Guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; or (ii) payment in full of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facilities and all other obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments that the Guarantors could be required to make under the Guarantee is the principal amount of the Senior Credit Facilities plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, as of December 31, 2021, the Guarantors were not expected to be required to perform under the Guarantee. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Deferred Financing Costs In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the First Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment, the Company capitalized an additional $ 5.2 million of deferred financing costs. The Company allocated these costs between the term loan and the revolving credit facility based on the maximum borrowing capacity and amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. Previously unamortized deferred financing costs will continue to be amortized. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs was $ 1.2 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 1.1 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value of Debt As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 12. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2022 and 2036 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms . 83 NOVANTA INC.

Stockholders’ Equity and Share-Based Compensation Preferred Shares In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved a special resolution to amend the Company’s articles to authorize up to 7.0 million preferred shares for future issuance. The Company’s Board of Directors is authorized to designate and issue one or more series of preferred shares, fix the rights, preferences and designation, as deemed necessary or advisable, relating to the preferred shares, provided that no shares of any series may be entitled to more than one vote per share . As of December 31, 2021, no preferred shares had been issued and outstanding. Common Shares The Company has an unlimited number of non-par value common shares authorized for issuance. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, and to share ratably in the Company’s assets legally available for distribution to shareholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common shares have no redemption or conversion rights. Common Share Repurchases The Company’s Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at the Company’s discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, market prices of the Company’s common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated 85 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to the Company’s employees and directors, the plans do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share. During 2019, the Company repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 83.71 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. The Company had $ 9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2021. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of common shares, effective after the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan. No shares have been repurchased under the 2020 Repurchase Plan to date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $ 59.5 million available under the 2018 and 2020 share repurchase plans for future share repurchases. 2010 Incentive Award Plan In November 2010, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan under which the Company may grant share-based compensation awards to employees, consultants and directors. In May 2021, the Company’s shareholders approved an amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the “Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan”). The maximum number of shares which can be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan is 6,148,613 , subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and stock payments (collectively referred to as “Awards”). The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for specific limits on the number of shares with respect to Awards that may be granted to any person during any calendar year and the amount of cash that can be paid with respect to Awards to any one person during any calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan will expire and no further Awards may be granted after May 13, 2031 . As of December 31, 2021, there were 2,242,880 shares available for future awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. Shares subject to Awards that have expired, forfeited or settled in cash, or repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the awardee may be added back to the number of shares available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan and may be granted as new Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares will not be added back to the number of shares available for grant: (a) shares that are used to pay the exercise price for an option, (b) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to any Award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to the extent they exceed the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the tax liability based on minimum withholding rates, (c) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, (d) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and (e) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares issued to satisfy Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan may be previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares repurchased on the open market. 86 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in operating income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 17,255 $ 14,550 $ 8,361 Research and development and engineering 2,294 3,301 497 Cost of revenue 3,008 4,684 482 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 3,049 584 — Total share-based compensation expense $ 25,606 $ 23,119 $ 9,340 The expense recorded during each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 included $ 1.1 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively, related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s outstanding equity awards for which compensation expense will be recognized in the future consisted of time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units granted under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Company expects to record an aggregate share-based compensation expense of $ 31.4 million, net of estimated forfeitures, over a weighted average period of 1.05 years subsequent to December 31, 2021, for all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2021. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued to employees with vesting periods ranging from zero to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 91 thousand and 162 thousand DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities during 2021 relating to restricted and deferred stock units issued and outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Restricted and Deferred Stock Units (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2020 625 $ 58.79 Granted 176 $ 137.90 Vested ( 487 ) $ 51.38 Forfeited ( 22 ) $ 104.98 Unvested at December 31, 2021 292 $ 115.42 0.95 years $ 51,442 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2021 277 $ 115.17 0.95 years $ 48,822 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 176.33 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2021 due to the fact that the restricted stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. The total fair value of restricted stock units and deferred stock units that vested in 2021, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the day of vesting, was $ 68.5 million. 87 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of a three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over the three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. In February 2021, the Company granted operating cash flow performance-based restricted stock units (“OCF-PSUs”) to certain members of the executive management team. Upon completion of the requisite service periods, the OCF-PSUs will vest in two tranches if the Company achieves the cumulative operating cash flow performance target for fiscal years 2021 through 2023 as approved by the Company’s Compensation Committee as of the date of grant. The first fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the four-year service period from the date of grant and the remaining fifty percent of the OCF-PSU grant will vest at the end of the five-year service period from the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period based on the expectation that 100 percent of the OCF-PSUs are deemed probable of vesting. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 88 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The table below summarizes activities during 2021 relating to performance-based stock awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Performance Stock Units (1) (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (2) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2020 142 $ 88.99 Granted 67 $ 150.89 Performance adjustment (3) 28 $ 67.72 Vested ( 75 ) $ 64.25 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at December 31, 2021 162 $ 122.26 1.55 years $ 28,461 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2021 197 $ 130.33 1.55 years $ 34,749 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target. The number of shares vested reflects the number of shares earned and issued during the year. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned was approximately 286 thousand. (2) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 176.33 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2021 due to the fact that the performance stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. (3) The amount shown represents performance adjustments for performance-based awards granted on February 22, 2018. These awards vested at 160 % of target number of shares during 2021 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2018 through 2020. The total fair value of PSUs that vested in 2021, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting, was $ 9.3 million. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2021 Grant-date stock price $ 138.23 Expected volatility 42.44 % Risk-free interest rate 0.22 % Expected annual dividend yield — Weighted average fair value $ 166.64 Stock Options On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 193 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vested ratably on the anniversary date of the grant date over a three-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of these stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options included the expected option term, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected term of the options, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company recognized the compensation expense of stock options on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. No stock options were granted during 2021. 89 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The following table shows stock options that were outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2021 and the related weighted average exercise price, weighted average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value: Number of Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Stock options outstanding 60 $ 14.13 4.25 $ 9,753 Stock options exercisable 60 $ 14.13 4.25 $ 9,753 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the closing market price of $ 176.33 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2021 and the exercise price of the stock options. 14. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution employee retirement savings plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. The Company matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis of percentages specified in each plan. The Company’s matching contributions to the plans were $ 4.4 million, $ 4.2 million and $ 4.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Defined Benefit Plan The Company maintains a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003. Benefits under the U.K. Plan were based on the participants’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen in 2003, adjusted for inflation. The Company continues to fund the plan in accordance with the pension regulations in the U.K. The net periodic pension cost is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following components (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Components of the net periodic pension cost: Interest cost $ 554 $ 736 $ 971 Expected return on plan assets ( 1,120 ) ( 1,340 ) ( 1,671 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 928 686 957 Amortization of prior service cost 31 29 29 Net periodic pension cost $ 393 $ 111 $ 286 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Weighted-average discount rate 1.2 % 1.9 % 2.7 % Weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets 2.5 % 3.6 % 5.1 % The actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Weighted-average discount rate 1.8 % 1.2 % Rate of inflation 3.2 % 2.6 % 90 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 The discount rates used are derived from (AA) corporate bonds that have maturities approximating the terms of the pension obligations under the U.K. Plan. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the historical performance of the major asset classes held by the U.K. Plan and current forecasts of future rates of return for these asset classes. The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.K. Plan (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Change in benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 47,200 $ 40,456 Interest cost 554 736 Actuarial (gains) losses (1) ( 3,303 ) 5,410 Benefits paid ( 2,679 ) ( 1,111 ) Prior service cost 36 — Foreign currency exchange rate changes ( 410 ) 1,709 Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 41,398 $ 47,200 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 41,398 $ 47,200 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 45,689 $ 38,983 Actual return on plan assets 592 5,170 Employer contributions 1,055 988 Benefits paid ( 2,679 ) ( 1,111 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes ( 470 ) 1,659 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 44,187 $ 45,689 Funded status at end of year $ 2,789 $ ( 1,511 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost: Net actuarial losses at beginning of year $ ( 10,958 ) $ ( 9,706 ) Net actuarial gains (losses) during the year 2,775 ( 1,580 ) Prior service cost arising during the year ( 36 ) - Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income before income taxes 959 715 Foreign currency exchange rate changes 54 ( 387 ) Net actuarial losses $ ( 7,206 ) $ ( 10,958 ) (1) Actuarial (gains)/losses in the U.K. Plan for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate assumptions. The funded status of the U.K. Plan was included in other long term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and in other long term liabilities as of December 31, 2020. The following table reflects the total expected benefit payments to plan participants for each of the next five years and the following five years in aggregate and have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands): Amount 2022 $ 1,090 2023 1,198 2024 1,567 2025 1,447 2026 1,677 2027-2031 9,765 Total $ 16,744 91 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 In the U.K., funding valuations are conducted every three years in order to determine the future level of contributions. Based on the results of the most recent valuation, the Company’s annual contributions will be approximately $ 1.1 million in 2022 and will increase by 2.9 % per year thereafter. Fair Value of Plan Assets The trustee of the U.K. Plan has the fiduciary responsibilities to manage the plan assets in consultation with the Company. The overall objective is to invest plan assets in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve balanced growth through a combination of investments in equities for long-term growth and investments in debt instruments that match a portion of the expected future benefit payments and to maintain adequate liquidity to make pension payments to pensioners.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 Deferred income taxes result principally from temporary differences in the recognition of certain revenue and expense items and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for financial and tax reporting purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Losses $ 9,358 $ 8,524 Operating lease liabilities 12,200 10,216 Compensation related deductions 6,795 5,955 Inventories 6,594 5,090 Tax credits 2,786 2,958 Restructuring related liabilities 206 185 Warranty 700 720 Other 197 957 Total deferred tax assets 38,836 34,605 Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets ( 12,608 ) ( 11,561 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 26,228 $ 23,044 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation $ ( 2,585 ) $ ( 1,583 ) Amortization ( 32,117 ) ( 24,772 ) Unrealized currency gains/losses - ( 372 ) Operating lease right-of-use assets ( 11,667 ) ( 9,960 ) Deferred revenue ( 1,391 ) — Total deferred tax liabilities $ ( 47,760 ) $ ( 36,687 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ ( 21,532 ) $ ( 13,643 ) In determining its income tax provisions, the Company calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate jurisdiction. The Company then considered a number of factors, including positive and negative evidence related to the realization of its deferred tax assets, to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to its deferred tax assets. In 2021, the Company recorded an additional $ 0.9 million valuation allowance. In 2020, the Company reversed valuation allowance of $ 0.7 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to current and forecast taxable income. In 2019, the Company reversed valuation allowance of $ 0.5 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income generated during the year. Valuation allowance continues to be provided on the remaining balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that they will be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.5 million (tax effected). Of this amount, approximately $ 2.9 million relates to Canada and begin to expire starting in 2033 and have a full valuation allowance. The remainder $ 0.6 million relates to various U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions, of which $ 0.2 million can be carried forward indefinitely and the remaining $ 0.4 million will begin to expire in 2022 through 2036 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.9 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely and have a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.1 million and $ 0.8 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.1 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $ 0.9 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037 ; and $ 2.1 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.1 million and $ 0.6 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 3.8 million. Approximately $ 2.6 million relate primarily to the U.S. and other immaterial foreign jurisdictions and will expire through 2042 . The remaining $ 1.2 95 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 0.5 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 3.3 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $ 1.4 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $ 1.3 million will expire through 2035 and $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $ 1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 1.2 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount recognized for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. The excess amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $ 266.1 million as of December 31, 2021. The estimated unrecognized income tax and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $ 4.0 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $ 4.8 million, of which $ 4.6 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to reverse up to $ 0.5 million of previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all significant income tax uncertainties. The reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 4,725 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 727 Additions for tax positions of prior years 5 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 31 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 497 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2019 4,929 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 476 Additions for tax positions of prior years 356 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 5 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 498 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2020 5,258 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 1,162 Additions for tax positions of prior years 9 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 41 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 1,591 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 4,797 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax provision. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had approximately $ 0.6 million and $ 0.7 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized ($ 0.1 ) million, $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, of expense for an increase (decrease) in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 96 NOVANTA INC.

This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program has been focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. In 2021, the Company recorded $ 8.1 million in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. The Company anticipates completing the 2020 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expects to incur additional restructuring charges between $ 3.5 million and $ 4.5 million related to the 2020 restructuring program in the next twelve months. The following table summarizes restructuring costs associated with the 2020 restructuring program by reportable segment (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, Cumulative Costs as of 2021 2020 December 31, 2021 Photonics $ 3,085 $ 740 $ 3,825 Vision 813 1,330 2,143 Precision Motion 4,206 524 4,730 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services 29 142 171 Total $ 8,133 $ 2,736 $ 10,869 97 NOVANTA INC.

In 2021, the Company recorded $ 0.2 million in severance and related costs in connection with the 2019 restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2021, the Company incurred cumulative costs related to this restructuring plan totaling $ 9.0 million. The 2019 restructuring program was completed in the first quarter of 2021. Rollforward of Accrued Expenses Related to Restructuring The following table summarizes the accrual activities, by component, related to the Company’s restructuring charges recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets (in thousands): Total Employee Related Facility Related Other Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 2,073 $ 1,988 $ — $ 85 Restructuring charges 4,477 3,506 503 468 Cash payments ( 4,024 ) ( 3,229 ) ( 115 ) ( 680 ) Non-cash write-offs and other adjustments ( 726 ) ( 584 ) ( 272 ) 130 Balance at December 31, 2020 1,800 1,681 116 3 Restructuring charges 8,341 6,462 1,309 570 Cash payments ( 3,727 ) ( 2,898 ) ( 226 ) ( 603 ) Non-cash write-offs and other adjustments (1) ( 3,728 ) ( 3,138 ) ( 649 ) 59 Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 2,686 $ 2,107 $ 550 $ 29 ( 1 ) Non-cash charges included stock-based compensation charges amounting to $ 3.0 million associated with severance agreements for certain employees.

The acquisition related costs for 2021 were $( 0.5 ) million, $ 2.5 million, $ 2.0 million and $ 5.7 million for Photonics, Vision, Precision Motion, and Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services reportable segments, respectively. 17. Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase commitments primarily for inventory purchases of $ 169.6 million. These purchase commitments are expected to be incurred as follows: $ 167.1 million in 2022 and $ 2.5 million in 2023. Legal Proceedings In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before the Company acquired it. The arbitration demand alleged breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant sought compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. During the second quarter of 2021, the arbitrator formally closed the arbitration pursuant to a settlement between the parties. No financial damages payments were made by the Company. The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the 98 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2021 determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities, whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever, of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties The Company maintains financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. From time to time, certain of these instruments may subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk whereby one institution may hold a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents, or one customer may represent a large portion of the accounts receivable balances. There was no significant concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s position in trade accounts receivable as no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is generally minimized because of the diversification of the Company’s operations, as well as its large customer base and its geographic dispersion. Certain of the components and materials included in the Company’s products are currently obtained from single source suppliers. There can be no assurance that a disruption of the supply of such components and materials would not create substantial manufacturing delays and additional cost to the Company. The Company’s operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, rapidly changing technologies, and international operations. 18.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are included in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in those certifications. Those certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures as of December 31, 2021 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2021. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making their assessment, our management utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include ATI Industrial Automation, Inc (“ATI”). and Schneider Electric Motion USA, Inc.(“SEM”), both acquired in purchase business combinations in 2021 and included in our 2021 consolidated financial statements. ATI and SEM, whose assets and revenues excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 5% and 1% of total assets, respectively, and approximately 5% and 1% of total revenues, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 ) , issued by COSO, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 103 It em 9B.

Through a series of strategic divestitures and acquisitions, the Company transformed from one that was more focused on the semiconductor industry to one that primarily sells components and sub-systems to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The Company changed its name to Novanta Inc. in May 2016. Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and 1 - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites, and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Recent Developments Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Our Employees In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investment in technologies and monitoring equipment. We expect such costs to continue to grow and be significant to our cost of operations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. We are committed to retaining and supporting our employees during this pandemic. To retain our employees, we issued to all of our employees, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 at a total fair value of $14.4 million in the aggregate. The restricted stock units vested in February 2021. These actions were implemented to create an ownership mindset and focus among all employees for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and through the expected recovery, while maintaining the Company’s talent and capabilities. Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the 2020 compensation plans for our executive officers and a Section 16 officer (collectively, the “Officers”) in February 2020. To support our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Officers agreed to a reduction in cash compensation. Further, the Officers did not receive the special one-time restricted stock unit grant issued to the rest of the employees. In June 2020, our Board of Directors agreed to forgo the cash retainers payable to our non-employee directors for the third quarter of 2020. 2 Our Customers The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic slowdown and a global recession. In 2020, the decline in customer demand in both the medical and advanced industrial end markets resulted in a decrease in sales to many of our customers. In the event of a further prolonged economic recession, overall demand for our products could decline further in the near term and our business would be adversely affected to a greater extent. Our Facilities Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities worldwide implemented numerous evolving measures to try to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on social gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business shutdowns and social distancing. We have important manufacturing operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and China, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, our manufacturing facilities around the world were in operation. While governmental measures may be modified or extended in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the spread of new variants of the virus, and delays in effective vaccination of a large proportion of the populations, we have taken measures to protect our employees and expect our manufacturing facilities to remain operational. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited absenteeism from those employees who are required to be on site to perform their jobs. Our Supply Chain We have experienced limited disruption to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date. We regularly monitor the financial health and manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause further disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. Our Liquidity With respect to liquidity, we have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These actions included reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, deferring lease payments on certain facilities, and deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments in accordance with relief provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). As of December 31, 2020, we deferred $2.8 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. Due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans in April 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $125.1 million and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of $395.2 million. We have reviewed numerous potential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Additionally, we believe we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months. 3 Acquisitions We continuously evaluate our business mix and financial performance. Since 2013, we have executed a series of acquisitions in line with our strategy. The following table summarizes significant acquisitions since 2013: Company Year of Acquisition Total Purchase Price (in thousands) ARGES GmbH 2019 $ 73,151 Zettlex Holdings Limited 2018 $ 32,026 Laser Quantum Limited (24%) (1) 2018 $ 45,053 Laser Quantum Limited (35%) 2017 $ 31,052 W.O.M.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2020, the medical market accounted for approximately 56% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Approximately 70% of our medical end market sales are related to surgical procedures, both elective and emergency based. 7 Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2020, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 44% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory stocking requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital . Customers We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue from an OEM customer in the medical end market which accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated revenue. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Our customers include a large number of OEMs who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. We also sell a very small portion of our products directly to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on a number of factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain of our products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. Seasonality While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the lower seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles. Backlog As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our consolidated backlog was approximately $239.6 million and $243.1 million, respectively. The majority of orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve months. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. Manufacturing Manufacturing functions are performed internally either when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process, or for cost related reasons, while other portions of the manufacture of our products are outsourced to highly qualified third parties. Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Wackersdorf, Germany; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse and Rochester, New York; Bradenton, Florida; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Rocklin, California; Poole and Cambridge, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Many of our products are produced in manufacturing facilities certified under ISO 9001 certification, while the majority of our products manufactured for the medical market are produced in factories under ISO 13485 certification. The manufacturing facilities 8 for o ur medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are ISO 14001 certifi ed . Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders , imaging informatics and medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices ( c GMPs ), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the U nited States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). Marketing, Sales and Distribution We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. Sales outside of the United States are largely based on a direct sales force, but occasionally are sold through distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Competition The markets in which we compete are dynamic and highly competitive. While no single company competes with us across the breadth of our product offerings, we face a fragmented competitive landscape, with competitors in particular product categories and individual application areas. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small private firms, which produce a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments. Competitors for our products are fragmented by particular product categories, and the individual markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our major competitors by reportable segments include, among others: Photonics: SCANLAB, Coherent, and a few smaller competitors. Vision: Barco, Omron Microscan Systems, and a few smaller competitors. Precision Motion: Renishaw, HEIDENHAIN, Physik Instrument, and a few smaller competitors. Competitive factors in our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include product performance, price, quality and reliability, features, compatibility of products with existing systems, technical support, product breadth, market presence and our overall reputation. We believe that our products offer a number of competitive advantages, and the breadth of technologies we offer gives us deep market application knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs and distinguishes us from our competitors. Ultimately, any inability to deliver high-quality products timely when the customer needs them presents the biggest threat to our competitiveness. Raw Materials, Components and Supplies Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Patents and Intellectual Property We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold a number of registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. 9 Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is mater ial to our business as a whole. We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital We believe that our employees are our most important asset. The Chief Human Resources Officer (""CHRO"") is responsible for developing and executing our human capital strategy. This includes the acquisition, development, and retention of talent to deliver on our strategy as well as the design of employee compensation and benefits and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The CHRO and the Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") regularly update our board of directors on the operation and status of these human capital activities; including, but not limited to, Novanta’s talent development, diversity, equity and inclusion, and succession planning programs. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,200 people, of which approximately 37% were in the United States, 51% in Europe, and 12% in Asia. We win with our customers by delivering new technology innovations through our highly technical Research & Development (“R&D”) team of approximately 420 employees. We believe that our employees should have a meaningful role helping us develop our culture. We utilize survey feedback mechanisms for employee engagement and organizational health to measure our current situation and gain insight into areas where we can improve. We have conducted surveys of our entire employee population in 2018 and 2020 and we compare our employee engagement and organizational health scores against benchmark populations with our survey vendors. We have achieved employee participation levels of nearly 90% of our active employees and have developed specific action plans across the Company as a result of their feedback. We are executing on our action plans with the expectation to improve our overall organization health and employee engagement. All employees are responsible for upholding the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which is important in delivering on our strategy. We maintain a compliance hotline for the confidential reporting of any suspected policy violations or unethical business conduct on the part of our businesses, employees, officers, directors, or suppliers and provide training and education to our global workforce with respect to our Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, data privacy regulations and workplace harassment. Diversity and inclusion The Novanta Way defines the fabric of our culture and how we work together, and it starts with building cohesive teams. Our teams must be diverse and inclusive, based on trust, commitment, and accountability. Our diversity is reflected in governance, leadership, influence, and technical expertise at all levels in the organization. We do not tolerate discrimination and harassment. We expect our teams to respect our core values and to conduct themselves ethically at all times in accordance with the Novanta Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. As of December 31, 2020, our board of directors was 75% comprised of men and 25% comprised of women, which was a doubling of women representation on our board of directors from 2019. In addition, in December 2020, our board of directors elected a new director as of February 2021, which will result in 33% of our board of directors coming from underrepresented communities. As of December 31, 2020, our gender diversification efforts resulted in 35% of our workforce being women, and the proportion of women in management positions amounted to 25%. During 2020, in line with our strategic initiative of increasing representation of employees from underrepresented communities, we launched a series of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives to make stronger progress on our goals by the year 2023. Compensation and Benefits We strive to provide market competitive compensation, benefits and services that help meet the varying needs of our employees. In addition to salaries and wages, these programs, which vary by country, can include annual bonuses, sales commissions, stock-based compensation awards, defined contribution retirement savings plans with company matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, flexible spending accounts, health savings account with company matching contributions, unlimited paid time off, paid family leave, and tuition assistance. Certain U.S. facilities have a dedicated medical professional on site to provide basic healthcare 10 services to employees, provide general first aid, assess employee health risks and promote employee health. Our bonus and commission payment programs allow for higher payouts when goals are exceeded and lower payouts when goals are not met. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we recognized the importance of retaining and supporting our employees. To further that end, we issued to all of our employees, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 at a total fair value of $14.4 million in the aggregate. The restricted stock units vested in February 2021. This action was implemented to create an ownership mindset, increase retention, and to provide some certainty and employee engagement in uncertain times. We wanted to create an urgency and focus among all employees to do what was necessary to ensure the Company’s financial health for the duration of the pandemic and through the expected recovery, while preserving our differentiated talent and capabilities throughout the Company. Growth and Development We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Novanta an employer of choice. In certain countries, we offer college tuition reimbursement for eligible employees for undergraduate and graduate studies. In 2019, we founded Novanta University as a primary instrument of company-wide learning management. A full-time specialist and the Company’s human resources department coordinate the onboarding of new employees and the regular training of the entire workforce. Internal and external courses are available for this purpose. In addition to Novanta University, we utilize our Novanta Growth System, which provides processes, tools, and trainings with a focus on continuous improvement. Safety and Wellbeing of Our Employees We provide mandatory safety trainings in our production facilities, which are designed to focus on empowering our employees with the knowledge and tools they need to make safe choices and to mitigate risks. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, mandatory actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the Company level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and to manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures consistently across our locations worldwide. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing health checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who need to be physically present in our facilities. Many of these actions were at a significant cost to the Company and we expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained and the safety of our employees is reasonably assured. Cybersecurity We have adopted and are implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The NIST CSF integrates industry standards and best practices to help organizations manage their cybersecurity risks. The NIST CSF helps organizations understand their cybersecurity risks (threats, vulnerabilities and impacts) and how to reduce these risks with customized measures, such as organization-wide cybersecurity awareness training. The Company’s Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee reviews quarterly with management and internal audit the Company’s cybersecurity program and related matters. There have been no material information security breaches for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Net expenses incurred in connection with information security breaches have been immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Government Regulation Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies and we monitor those changes closely. 11 Environmental Regulations Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)). Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions that have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment. Medical Device Regulations Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (“the FDA”). We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and local authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products. FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements. 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. 12 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is prepared by the manufacturer in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. In these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Post-market Regulations After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: • establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; • QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; • labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; • FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; • clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices; • medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; • correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; • requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database; • the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and • post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device. We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. 13 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: • warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; • recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; • refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; • withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; • refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or • criminal prosecution. Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. These laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the federal government information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs.

Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. 14 Risks Relating to O ur Business Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. In particular, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in regions across the globe and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels and reduced the demand for our products in 2020. Continued or worsening conditions could further reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and is expected to further adversely impact our business and results of operations. In 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and spread across the world. The outbreak and government measures taken in response have had a significant adverse impact, both direct and indirect, on our businesses and the economy. We have experienced weakened demand from certain customers in the advanced industrial and medical end-markets, which has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our revenues. For example, healthcare providers have deferred elective medical procedures in order to focus on combatting the pandemic, which has significantly reduced demand for certain of our medical products. Certain other customers have delayed their research and development programs, which has negatively affected the demand for some of our products. If these trends continue, our revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. We also faced difficulty sourcing some materials and components necessary to fulfill production requirements and meeting scheduled shipments due to shipping and transportation disruptions. If these disruptions were to continue or worsen, our ability to manufacture our products or meet our customers’ schedules may be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. Even if we are able to find alternate sources of supply for such materials or components, they may cost more or be of lower quality, which could affect our profitability, financial condition and business. While the impact of the pandemic on our manufacturing capabilities and research and development activities has been limited to date, there can be no assurance that our ability to manufacture our products and to develop new products and technologies will not be disrupted in the future, due to sickness of employees, mandatory stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, social distancing practices, supply interruptions or other potential disruptions. We have also faced, and may face in the future, limitations on our employee resources as a result of various causes, including stay-at-home orders from local governments, sickness of employees or their families, or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. The pandemic has also diverted management resources and the prolonged work-from-home arrangements have increased business continuity and cybersecurity risks. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak impacts our business, liquidity and financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the continued geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the pandemic, the location, duration and magnitude of future waves of infection, new mutations of the virus, delays in vaccine rollout, the effectiveness of vaccines against the virus and its mutations, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States, the European Union, China and other countries, the duration and extent of business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. If we or our customers experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions in the future, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and within planned timelines could be materially adversely impacted, and our business and financial results may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets. There is no assurance that future resurgence of COVID-19 infections and further economic downturns will not cause volatilities in the capital markets, which may adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, such as what occurred in March and April 2020. 15 Our business depends significantly upon our customers’ capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations. Certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment markets, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, in 2019 and 2020, our sales into the advanced industrial end market declined as a result of a widespread downturn in this end market that is continuing. We cannot predict when slowdowns will recur or that the impact of such slowdowns will be more or less significant compared to historical fluctuations. Our business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility into future business declines. During a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand could prompt customers to look for alternative sources of supply or leave our customers without a supply, both of which events could harm our reputation and make it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business. In periods of weak demand, such as the recent environment, we have been, and may in the future be, required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase inventories or manufacture products that we are unable to sell. The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate and to manage transitions to new product innovations. Technology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers’ requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business. We cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. If any of our new or enhanced products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, or if our competitors release similar products or enhancements at the same time that are more widely accepted by our customers, our revenue and results of operations for one or more reporting periods could be adversely affected. If we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. Our research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including: • changing product specifications and customer requirements; • unanticipated engineering complexities; • changing market or competitive product requirements; • difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; and • inability to manufacture new products cost effectively. 16 New products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, and may have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be difficulty in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful. Any of these adverse developments could lead to loss of market share and inability to achieve our anticipated revenue growth targets. Customer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Changes in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include: • fluctuations in our customers’ businesses; • decisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products; • timing and recognition of revenues from customer orders; • timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors; • availability of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors; • changes in the prices of our products or of our competitors’ products; and • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We received in the past, and may receive in the future, several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers’ businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods. Delays in shipments near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period. In addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. As a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial, customer and employee information. Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions. Certain other events could also result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, or other liabilities that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our information technology systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security of our information technology systems, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which would adversely affect our results of operations. 17 Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws, regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business and financial results. Legislation in various countries around the world with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection is rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, has caused more stringent data protection requirements in the EU and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects how their personal data is to be used; imposes limitations on retention of personal data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we have business operations or are otherwise subject to the GDPR. Certain breaches of the GDPR requirements could result in substantial fines, which can be up to four percent of worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well as potential civil claims, including class action type litigation where individuals suffered harm. Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EEA and the EU, and the expiration of the transition period, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global revenue. On January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom became a third country for the purposes of the GDPR. Similarly, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was recently enacted in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required. The CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Any liability from our failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our GDPR and CCPA compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts in general. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR, CCPA or other applicable regimes. Changes in foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds or Japanese Yen, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors. Additionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks. Our reliance on international operations subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 62% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including: • foreign exchange rate fluctuations; • increases in shipping costs; 18 • longer customer payment cycles; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • use of incompatible systems and equipment; • problems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures; • trade tariffs, trade barriers and export/import controls; • transportation delays and interruptions; • increased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights; • government currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings; • compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including those that potentially conflict with other jurisdictions; • the impact of recessionary foreign economies; and • natural disasters, wars, health epidemics and acts of terrorism. We also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct, which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws. Increased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the U.S. leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business. We are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China, Southeast Asia and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries and public health crises could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products, or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property. Increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our operations. Our sales channels and supply chain in the international marketplace make us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we sell, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and other countries have escalated in recent years. U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are or were subject to these tariffs, which have increased our manufacturing costs and have made our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been and may in the future be subject to retaliatory tariffs in China, which increase our cost and make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. If heightened tariffs were to be imposed in the future, we may not be able to mitigate the impacts of such tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position could be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain other foreign markets could also become subject to retaliatory tariffs, making our products uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of our common shares. We are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations in the U.K., Germany and China. Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the U.K. government, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period. On December 24, 2020, the UK and the EU announced that they had concluded their negotiations relating to their future trading relationship. The agreed terms are contained in the EU—UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”), which became binding on both the EU and the UK on January 1, 2021. While agreement on the 19 terms of the TCA has avoided a “no deal” Brexit scenario, and provides in principle for quota and tariff-free trading of goods, it is nevertheless expected that the TCA will result in the creation of non-tariff barriers (such as increased shipping and regulatory costs and complexities) to the trade in goods between the UK and the EU. Further, the TCA does not provide for the continued free movement of services between the UK and the EU and imposes additional restrictions on the free movement of people between the UK and the EU. The TCA also grants to each of the UK and the EU the ability, in certain circumstances, to unilaterally impose tariffs on one another. In the event of such an imposition, any additional tariffs may have a material adverse impact on us as well as the stability of UK-EU trade more generally. Any uncertainty as to UK or EU government policies and, in particular, whether any such policy may result in the imposition of reciprocal tariffs, may depress economic activity or have an adverse impact on our business and operations. It remains to be seen whether the initial implementation of, and adjustment of UK-EU trading processes for, the TCA could increase our costs or otherwise negatively impact our sales of products, mobility of our personnel and our access to capital. Others may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights. Our future success depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any applications filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors. Our operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties. We have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. We could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement. We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences. Some of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses. As part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of ARGES GmbH, Med X Change,Inc., Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and Zettlex Holdings Limited, and 20 we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management’s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. Further, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate operations into our businesses. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. If we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating and cost structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses and improve gross margin is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings and gross margin improvements. We are taking, and may need to take in the future, additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. We are also taking actions to improve our price realization, reduce our overhead and cost of poor quality, and improve our material productivity. Failure to successfully implement these actions could negatively impact our ability to achieve our gross margin goals. Product defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors’ products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation. We produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors’ products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 21 Disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or a single source of supply. If a single source supplier decides to stop producing a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is otherwise delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such decisions or delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders. In addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders. If we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on multiple factors, including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers. Production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. If production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were disrupted by a natural disaster, health epidemic, and act of terrorism or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of: • mistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations; • changing process technologies; • ramping production; • installing new equipment at our manufacturing facilities; • implementing new information technology systems; • shortage of key components; and • loss of electricity or employees’ access to the manufacturing facilities due to man-made and natural disasters. From time to time, we determine to consolidate certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping delays, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. 22 In addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the key package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers. We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Some of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive) and to obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could: • take a significant period of time; • require substantial resources; • involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; • require changes to products; and • result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. In April 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (Regulation 2017/745), which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the member states of EEA, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them, in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. The Medical Devices Regulation (“MDR”), among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR was meant to become applicable in May 2020. However, on April 23, 2020, the European Council and Parliament postponed the effective date of the MDR to May 2021. Once applicable, the MDR will among other things: • strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; • establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; • improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; • set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and • strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. 23 We face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and E U competent authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future changes. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new statutes, regulations, or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs, lengthen regulatory review time for, or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of our products. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval, changes to manufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products, or require additional record keeping. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and operations are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties. Our products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sale, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include: • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; • federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors; • the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; • HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; • the federal physician “Sunshine Act” requirements, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (the “CMS”) information related to (i) payments 24 and other transfers of value to physicians (as defined by statute), certain other healthcare providers ( beginning in 2022 ) , and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; • state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as (i) anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; (ii) state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; (iii) state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and (iv) state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Efforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products. Several of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurs, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. Various elements of healthcare reforms, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may have material adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could result in significant costs. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations relating to the manufacture of products using beryllium. We are subject to regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to regulatory fines. 25 Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability. If we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on centralized information systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become proficient in the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of upgrades and new ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2020, we had $434.5 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets. Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reliance upon third party distribution channels subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control. We sell many of our products through resellers, distributors, and system integrators. As these third parties tend to have more limited financial resources than OEM and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk. Any significant downturn in the business of our resellers, distributors, and systems integrators would in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales also depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Taxes Novanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation. Novanta Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends, royalties and certain types of interest. 26 Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure We may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, the need to invest in cloud-based enterprise resource planning systems and other digital technology platforms to help accelerate the growth of our businesses, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt of $204.8 million under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (as amended, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and $395.2 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares. Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had $204.8 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: • reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, changes in the general economic environment, and market changes in the industries in which we operate; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder. General Risk Factors The market price for our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by: • quarterly variations in our results of operations; • changes in earnings estimates by analysts; • conditions in the markets we serve; • trading phenomena such as “short squeeze”; or • general market, political or economic conditions. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares. 27 Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, and/or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers’ failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition. If we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business. While our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls in order to make such improvements. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources, including management time and attention, from other activities. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business and the trading price of our common shares. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. Item 1B.

Market for Registrant’s Common Shares, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information The Company’s common shares, no par value, are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “NOVT”. Holders As of the close of business on February 22, 2021, there were approximately 33 holders of record of the Company’s common shares. Since many of the common shares are registered in “nominee” or “street” names, the Company believes that the total number of beneficial owners is considerably higher. Dividend Policy The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchaser In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of the Company’s common shares. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of our common shares. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the adoption of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, the Company has repurchased 185 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $15.5 million at an average price of $83.97 per share. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2020. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to an additional $50.0 million of the Company’s common shares (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), to be commenced following the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan. While the 2020 Repurchase Plan is intended to generally offset dilution from equity awards to the Company’s employees and directors, the plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of our common shares. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2020 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans since April 2020. 30 Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on the Company’s common shares with the cumulative total return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index for the period from December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2020.

The operating results of these businesses have been included in the consolidated statement of operations since their respective acquisition dates. (2) In 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum and recorded a non-taxable gain of $26.4 million, representing the excess of the fair value of the Company’s previously-held equity interest in Laser Quantum over its carrying value upon gaining control. (3) In the computation of earnings per common share attributable to Novanta Inc., net income attributable to Novanta Inc. included $1.8 million and ($20.2) million of redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 32 December 31, 2020 2019 2018 2017 (2) 2016 (in thousands) Consolidated Balance Sheet Data: Cash and cash equivalents $ 125,054 $ 78,944 $ 82,043 $ 100,057 $ 68,108 Total assets (1) 865,179 869,736 719,576 726,703 425,637 Debt, current portion of long-term debt 5,508 5,031 4,535 9,119 7,366 Debt, long-term 194,927 215,334 202,843 225,500 70,554 Long-term liabilities, excluding debt (1) 79,214 102,384 44,282 44,567 25,717 Redeemable noncontrolling interest (3) — — — 46,923 — Total stockholders’ equity 476,809 417,172 368,255 311,545 258,870 (1) In 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” using the modified retrospective approach. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases. The Company reported operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $35.2 million and $39.2 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019. (2) In 2017, the Company completed the acquisitions of WOM, Laser Quantum and ThingMagic businesses. Total assets acquired amounted to $284.4 million as of the acquisition date. The acquisitions were financed with borrowings under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of $176.8 million. (3) In 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum, which increased our ownership position in Laser Quantum from approximately 41% to approximately 76%. The noncontrolling interest was considered a redeemable equity instrument and was presented as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying value or the estimated redemption value of the noncontrolling interest. In 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum from the noncontrolling interest shareholders. 33 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, anticipated impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial results and financial condition; our belief that the Purchasing Managers Index (“PMI”) may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market; our strategy; anticipated financial performance; expected liquidity and capitalization; drivers of revenue growth and our growth expectations in various markets; management’s plans and objectives for future operations, expenditures and product development, and investments in research and development; business prospects; potential of future product releases and expansion of our product and service offerings; anticipated revenue performance; industry trends; market conditions; our competitive positions; changes in economic and political conditions; changes in accounting principles; changes in actual or assumed tax liabilities; expectations regarding tax exposures; anticipated reinvestment of future earnings and dividend policy; anticipated expenditures in regard to the Company’s benefit plans; future acquisitions and integration and anticipated benefits from acquisitions and dispositions; anticipated economic benefits and expected costs of restructuring programs; ability to repay our indebtedness; our intentions regarding the use of cash; expectations regarding legal and regulatory requirements and our compliance thereto; and other statements that are not historical facts. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” “could,” “estimates,” “plans,” “would,” “should,” “potential,” “continues,” and similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) identify forward looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Management and the Company disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in its expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward looking statements, except as required under applicable law. Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2020, the medical market accounted for approximately 56% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Approximately 70% of our medical end market sales are related to surgical procedures, both elective and emergency based. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2020, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 44% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 34 Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites, and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Amendment to Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On March 27, 2020, we entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the third amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of December 31, 2019 (as amended, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for an aggregate credit facility of $450.0 million, comprised of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The First Amendment exercised a portion of the $200 million uncommitted accordion feature under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and increased the revolving credit facility commitment by $145 million, from $350 million to $495 million. Additionally, the uncommitted accordion feature was reset to $200 million for potential future expansion. Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business Our Employees In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees. We established steering committees at both the corporate level and at each of our facilities to provide leadership for and manage our COVID-19 risk mitigation actions and countermeasures. We have provided frequent employee communications that include guidance and updates to our employees with regards to COVID-19 safety procedures and status. We established rigorous safety measures in all of our facilities, including implementing social distancing protocols, requiring working from home for those employees that do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in our facilities to perform their work, suspending travel, spreading production over more shifts, implementing temperature checks at the entrances to our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing masks to those employees who must be physically present in our facilities. We expect to continue these measures until we determine that the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained for purposes of our business. In connection with our COVID-19 remediation actions, we have incurred additional costs to protect the health of our employees, including investment in technologies and monitoring equipment. We expect such costs to continue to grow and be significant to our 35 cost of operations. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interest of our employees. We are committed to retaining and supporting our employees during this pandemic. To retain our employees, we issued to all of our employees, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Human Resource Officer and the Chief Accounting Officer, a special one-time restricted stock unit grant in April 2020 at a total fair value of $14.4 million in the aggregate. The restricted stock units vested in February 2021. These actions were implemented to create an ownership mindset and focus among all employees for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and through the expected recovery, while maintaining the Company’s talent and capabilities. Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved the 2020 compensation plans for our executive officers and a Section 16 officer (collectively, the “Officers”) in February 2020. To support our business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Officers agreed to a reduction in cash compensation for 2020. Further, the Officers did not receive the special one-time restricted stock unit grant issued to the rest of the employees. In June 2020, our Board of Directors agreed to forgo the cash retainers payable to our non-employee directors for the third quarter of 2020. Our Customers The outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused a global economic slowdown and a global recession. In 2020, the decline in customer demand in both medical and advanced industrial end markets resulted in a decrease in sales to many of our customers. In the event of a further prolonged economic recession, overall demand for our products could decline further in the near term and our business would be adversely affected to a greater extent. Our Facilities Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental authorities worldwide implemented numerous evolving measures to try to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limits on social gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business shutdowns and social distancing. We have important manufacturing operations in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, and China, all of which have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, our manufacturing facilities around the world were in operation. While governmental measures may be modified or extended in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the spread of new variants of the virus, and delays in effective vaccination of a large proportion of the populations, we have taken measures to protect our employees and expect our manufacturing facilities to remain operational. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced limited absenteeism from those employees who are required to be on site to perform their jobs. Our Supply Chain We have experienced limited disruption to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to date. We regularly monitor the financial health and manufacturing output of companies in our supply chain. Hardship on our suppliers or sub-suppliers caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could cause further disruption in our ability to obtain raw materials or components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations. To mitigate the risk of any potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, we are identifying alternative suppliers, sourcing raw materials from different supplier locations, and taking other actions to ensure our supply of raw materials. Although we are mitigating potential supply interruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, if certain suppliers cannot produce a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain materials is otherwise delayed, we may miss our scheduled shipment deadlines and our relationship with customers may be harmed. Additionally, restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transports, port closures and increased border controls or closures, have resulted in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining raw materials from suppliers and for shipping finished products to customers. Our Liquidity With respect to liquidity, we have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These actions included reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, deferring lease payments on certain facilities, and deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments in accordance with relief provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). As of December 31, 2020, we deferred $2.8 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. Due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans in April 2020. 36 As of December 31 , 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $125. 1 million and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of $395.2 million. We have reviewed numerous potential scenarios in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from our operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months. Additionally, we believe we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants for the next twelve months. Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for 2020 was $590.6 million, a decrease of $35.5 million, or 5.7%, versus 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic as we experienced decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in industrial manufacturing spending and in the medical market as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures. The effect of our acquisitions in 2019 resulted in an increase in revenue of $8.4 million, or 1.3%. In addition, foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2020. Operating income increased $0.6 million from $55.3 million in 2019 to $55.9 million in 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to a decrease of selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $8.6 million and a decrease in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $12.8 million, offset by a decrease in gross profit of $17.6 million as a result of lower revenue and an increase in research and development and engineering (“R&D”) spending of $5.0 million. Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $1.27 in 2020 increased $0.11 from the basic EPS of $1.16 in 2019. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $1.25 in 2020 increased $0.10 from the diluted EPS of $1.15 in 2019. The increase of basic EPS and diluted EPS was primarily attributable to decreases in interest expense and income tax provision. Specific components of our operating results for 2020, 2019 and 2018 are further discussed below. Results of Operations The following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated: 2020 2019 2018 Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of revenue 58.6 58.1 57.4 Gross profit 41.4 41.9 42.6 Operating expenses: Research and development and engineering 10.3 8.9 8.3 Selling, general and administrative 18.6 18.9 18.9 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2.4 2.5 2.5 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 0.6 2.6 1.3 Total operating expenses 31.9 33.0 31.0 Operating income 9.5 8.8 11.6 Interest income (expense), net (1.1 ) (1.4 ) (1.6 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (0.2 ) (0.1 ) 0.0 Other income (expense), net 0.0 (0.0 ) (0.0 ) Income before income taxes 8.2 7.3 10.0 Income tax provision 0.7 0.8 1.7 Consolidated net income 7.5 6.5 8.3 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — - (0.3 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 7.5 % 6.5 % 8.0 % 37 Revenue The following table sets forth external revenue by reportable segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Photonics $ 199,613 $ 230,457 $ 249,339 (13.4 )% (7.6 )% Vision 261,650 271,407 232,902 (3.6 )% 16.5 % Precision Motion 129,360 124,235 132,096 4.1 % (6.0 )% Total $ 590,623 $ 626,099 $ 614,337 (5.7 )% 1.9 % Photonics Photonics segment revenue in 2020 decreased by $30.8 million, or 13.4%, versus 2019, primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in global industrial manufacturing spending and in the medical market as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures and a reduction in certain medical diagnostic testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Photonics segment revenue in 2019 decreased by $18.9 million, or 7.6%, versus 2018, primarily due to decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in global industrial manufacturing spending, and a decrease in revenue from our optical light engine products, partially offset by $4.9 million of revenue from the acquisition of ARGES in July 2019. Vision Vision segment revenue in 2020 decreased by $9.8 million, or 3.6%, versus 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue from our minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) products as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vision segment revenue in 2019 increased by $38.5 million, or 16.5%, versus 2018. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue of $28.4 million from our minimally invasive surgery products as a result of new product introductions and increased demand in the medical market and $5.4 million of revenue from the acquisition of Med X Change in June 2019 . Precision Motion Precision Motion segment revenue in 2020 increased by $5.1 million, or 4.1%, versus 2019, primarily due to an increase in revenue related to increased demand by microelectronics customers, partially offset by decreased demand in the medical market as a result of deferrals of elective surgical procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Precision Motion segment revenue in 2019 decreased by $7.9 million, or 6.0%, versus 2018. The decrease was primarily due to decreased demand in the microelectronics and industrial market related to reductions in global industrial manufacturing spending, partially offset by increased demand in the medical market and the acquisitions of Ingenia in April 2019 and Zettlex Holdings Limited (“Zettlex”) in May 2018. 38 Gross Profit The following table sets forth the gross profit and gross profit margin for each of our reportable segments for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Gross profit: Photonics $ 89,060 $ 105,845 $ 117,109 Vision 100,267 105,228 87,198 Precision Motion 58,279 53,326 59,477 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (3,089 ) (2,314 ) (2,256 ) Total $ 244,517 $ 262,085 $ 261,528 Gross profit margin: Photonics 44.6 % 45.9 % 47.0 % Vision 38.3 % 38.8 % 37.4 % Precision Motion 45.1 % 42.9 % 45.0 % Total 41.4 % 41.9 % 42.6 % Gross profit and gross profit margin can be influenced by a number of factors, including product mix, pricing, volume, manufacturing efficiencies and utilization, costs for raw materials and outsourced manufacturing, headcount, inventory obsolescence and warranty expenses. Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for 2020 decreased $16.8 million, or 15.9%, versus 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 44.6% for 2020, compared with a gross profit margin of 45.9% for 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to lower factory utilization associated with lower production volumes and higher costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Photonics segment gross profit for 2019 decreased $11.3 million, or 9.6%, versus 2018, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 45.9% for 2019, compared with a gross profit margin of 47.0% for 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to changes in product mix. Amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technologies increased $1.1 million, which resulted in a 0.5 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin. Vision Vision segment gross profit for 2020 decreased $5.0 million, or 4.7%, versus 2019, primarily due to a decrease in revenue. Vision segment gross profit margin was 38.3% for 2020, compared with a gross profit margin of 38.8% for 2019. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix changes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Vision segment gross profit for 2019 increased $18.0 million, or 20.7%, versus 2018, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Vision segment gross profit margin was 38.8% for 2019, compared with a gross profit margin of 37.4% for 2018. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to increased utilization of our German facility and cost reductions in our optical data collection products, partially offset by the cost of a redundant manufacturing facility in San Jose, California until the transfer of our manufacturing activities was substantially completed at the end of 2019. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for 2020 increased $5.0 million, or 9.3%, versus 2019, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 45.1% for 2020, compared with a gross profit margin of 42.9% for 2019. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to favorable product and customer mix changes as well as productivity improvements implemented during 2020. Precision Motion segment gross profit for 2019 decreased $6.2 million, or 10.3%, versus 2018, primarily due to a decrease in revenue and a decrease in gross profit margin. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 42.9% for 2019, compared with a gross profit margin of 45.0% for 2018. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to business volume reductions that could not be fully compensated by cost reduction initiatives. 39 Operating Expenses The following table sets forth operating expenses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollars in thousands): % Change 2020 2019 2018 2020 vs. 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Research and development and engineering $ 60,996 $ 55,965 $ 51,024 9.0 % 9.7 % Selling, general and administrative 109,853 118,407 115,900 (7.2 )% 2.2 % Amortization of purchased intangible assets 13,970 15,857 15,550 (11.9 )% 2.0 % Restructuring and acquisition related costs 3,810 16,574 8,041 (77.0 )% 106.1 % Total $ 188,629 $ 206,803 $ 190,515 (8.8 )% 8.5 % Research and Development and Engineering Expenses Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee compensation and related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. R&D expenses were $61.0 million, or 10.3% of revenue in 2020, versus $56.0 million, or 8.9% of revenue in 2019. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to R&D expenses added from 2019 acquisitions, higher R&D project spending and higher share-based compensation expense offset by lower cash compensation and a reduction in discretionary spending. R&D expenses were $56.0 million, or 8.9% of revenue in 2019, versus $51.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue in 2018. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to R&D expenses added from acquisitions and higher investments in R&D. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management. SG&A expenses were $109.9 million, or 18.6% of revenue, in 2020, versus $118.4 million, or 18.9% of revenue in 2019. SG&A expenses decreased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to lower cash compensation and lower discretionary spending, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. SG&A expenses were $118.4 million, or 18.9% of revenue in 2019, versus $115.9 million, or 18.9% of revenue in 2018. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to SG&A expenses added from acquisitions and higher professional services spending, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of developed technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, trade names, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $14.0 million, or 2.4% of revenue in 2020, versus $15.9 million, or 2.5% of revenue in 2019. The decrease in terms of total dollars was the result of certain acquired intangible assets being fully amortized at the end of 2019. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $15.9 million, or 2.5% of revenue, in 2019, versus $15.6 million, or 2.5% of revenue in 2018. The increase in terms of total dollars was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2018 and 2019. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs Restructuring and acquisition related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. 40 We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $3.8 million in 2020, versus $16.6 million in 2019. The decrease in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in restructuring charge s of $4.2 million and a decrease in acquisition and related cost s of $8.6 million. The decrease in acquisition and related costs was primarily attributable to the reduction in fair value of the contingent considerations in 2020 related to 2019 acquisitions and higher professional services fees for acquisitions during 2019 , offset by legal fees during 2020 related to a dispute involving a company we acquired in 2019. We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $16.6 million in 2019, versus $8.0 million in 2018. The increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs in 2019 versus 2018 was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $6.6 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and an increase in acquisition related costs of $1.9 million primarily related to an increase in professional services fees, partially offset by a decrease in costs recognized under earn-out agreements. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 34,001 $ 41,990 $ 59,285 Vision 16,354 21,007 8,991 Precision Motion 31,663 22,339 31,674 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (26,130 ) (30,054 ) (28,937 ) Total $ 55,888 $ 55,282 $ 71,013 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $34.0 million, or 17.0% of revenue, in 2020, versus $42.0 million, or 18.2% of revenue, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $16.8 million and an increase in R&D spending of $2.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense of $1.9 million, a decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges of $7.1 million, and a decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets of $2.3 million. Photonics segment operating income was $42.0 million, or 18.2% of revenue, in 2019, versus $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $11.3 million, an increase in R&D expenses of $2.1 million and restructuring related charges of $5.0 million associated with the 2019 restructuring program, including a $2.2 million impairment of an operating lease right-of-use asset. Vision Vision segment operating income was $16.4 million, or 6.3% of revenue, in 2020, versus $21.0 million, or 7.7% of revenue, in 2019. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $5.0 million, an increase in R&D spending of $2.6 million, and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related charges of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of SG&A expenses of $4.8 million. Vision segment operating income was $21.0 million, or 7.7% of revenue, in 2019, versus $9.0 million, or 3.9% of revenue, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $18.0 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $1.6 million and SG&A expenses of $2.8 million. Vision segment operating income was negatively affected by a $0.9 million net increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $31.7 million, or 24.5% of revenue, in 2020, versus $22.3 million, or 18.0% of revenue, in 2019. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $5.0 million, a decrease in SG&A expenses of $1.5 million, and a decrease in restructuring and acquisition related charges of $2.9 million. Precision Motion segment operating income was $22.3 million, or 18.0% of revenue, in 2019, versus $31.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $6.2 million, an increase in R&D expenses of $1.3 million and SG&A expenses of $2.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related earn-out costs of $1.8 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition. 41 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared SG&A functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2020 decreased by $3.9 million, or 13.1%, from 2019, primarily due to a decrease in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $4.4 million. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2019 increased by $1.1 million, or 3.9%, from 2018, primarily due to an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $3.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of $2.6 million primarily related to lower variable compensation expense. Interest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Interest income (expense), net $ (6,564 ) $ (8,493 ) $ (9,814 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (942 ) (780 ) 147 Other income (expense), net 21 (243 ) (44 ) Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $6.6 million in 2020 versus $8.5 million in 2019. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 2.32% and 3.30% during 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $1.1 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Net interest expense was $8.5 million in 2019 versus $9.8 million in 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities was 3.30% and 3.53% during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.9 million net losses in 2020 versus $0.8 million net losses in 2019 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.8 million net losses in 2019 versus $0.1 million net gains in 2018 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and the Euro, and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income Tax Provision We recorded a tax provision of $3.9 million in 2020, compared to a tax provision of $5.0 million in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2020 was 8.0% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 10.9% of income before income taxes for 2019. Our effective tax rate for 2020 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, $1.3 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, $2.3 million benefit from share-based compensation, $0.7 million reversal of valuation allowance recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to current and forecasted taxable income, $2.0 million of R&D and other tax credits, $1.1 million of estimated deductions for foreign derived intangible income, and $1.5 million benefit from the reduction in fair value of non-deductible 42 acquisition contingent consideration liabilities, offset by miscellaneous other items such as foreign withholding taxes and impact of changes in statutory tax rates on our deferred tax attributes . We recorded a tax provision of $5.0 million in 2019, compared to a tax provision of $10.2 million in 2018. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 10.9% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 16.7% of income before income taxes for 2018. Our effective tax rate for 2019 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, a $2.0 million benefit from U.K. patent box deductions, a $1.7 million benefit from share-based compensation, $1.5 million of other tax credits, and $0.8 million of estimated deductions for foreign derived intangible income; offset by $0.3 million of non-deductible expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with various acquisitions and $0.2 million of non-deductible acquisition costs. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. federal government enacted the CARES Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package which, among other things, contains numerous provisions concerning income taxes. The CARES Act will not have a material impact on our income taxes or related disclosures. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest payments. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, risks associated with events outside of our control, such as economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of December 31, 2020, $92.1 million of our $125.1 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our senior credit facilities. Approximately $185.8 million of our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facilities were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. We are deferring certain U.S. payroll tax payments in 2020 in accordance with relief provisions under the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we deferred $2.8 million in certain U.S. payroll tax payments under the CARES Act. As permitted under the CARES Act, we expect to pay half of the deferred U.S. payroll taxes by December 31, 2021 and the remaining half by December 31, 2022. In addition, with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on liquidity, we have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures across the Company. These included reducing hiring activities, restricting travel, adjusting employee compensation by eliminating fiscal year 2020 cash bonuses and base salary increases, implementing an unpaid time-off program for substantially all of our non-production workforce, limiting discretionary spending, reducing or deferring spending on capital investment projects, and deferring lease payments on certain facilities. 43 Share Repurchase P lan s Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2020, we repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.5 million at an average price of $84.52 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2020. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under our share repurchase plans since April 2020. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, originally consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at anytime until maturity. On March 27, 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $145.0 million, from $350.0 million to $495.0 million, and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $200.0 million for potential future expansion. On June 2, 2020, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amendment revised our consolidated leverage ratio definition (as defined in the Third amended and Restated Credit Agreement) allowing for the use of up to $25 million unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as a reduction to consolidated funded indebtedness (as defined in the Third amended and Restated Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2020, we had $105.1 (€85.7) million term loan and $99.8 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% to 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement denominated in Euro and U.S. Dollars of $185.8 million and $19.0 million, respectively. 44 The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that , we believe , are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 20 20 : Requirement Actual December 31, 2020 Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.49 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 10.57 In addition, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents totaled $125.1 million at December 31, 2020, versus $78.9 million at December 31, 2019. The net increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities of $140.2 million offset by $35.4 million debt repayments, $31.0 million of payments of deferred and escrowed purchase price related to prior year acquisitions, $10.5 million capital expenditures, $8.6 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, and $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares. The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 125,054 $ 78,944 $ 82,043 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 140,239 $ 63,248 $ 89,647 Net cash used in investing activities $ (13,156 ) $ (63,844 ) $ (45,590 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (84,357 ) $ (3,935 ) $ (60,164 ) Unused borrowing capacity available under revolving credit facility, end of year $ 395,239 $ 226,616 $ 189,942 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $140.2 million in 2020, versus $63.2 million in 2019. Cash provided by operating activities increased from the prior year primarily due to working capital improvements resulting in an increase in cash inflows from reductions in accounts receivable and inventory balances, and a decrease in income tax payments. Cash provided by operating activities for 2020 was positively impacted by an increase in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.1 at December 31, 2019 to 3.7 at December 31, 2020 and a decrease in accounts receivable, offset by a decrease in our days payables outstanding which decreased from 53 days at December 31, 2019 to 45 days at December 31, 2020. During 2020, we paid the 2019 annual employee bonuses which had been accrued for as of December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 54 days at December 31, 2019 primarily due to poor sales linearity, a decrease in our outstanding payables and accrued expenses, excluding payables and accrued expenses assumed from acquisitions in 2019, and an increase in inventories. Our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.1 at December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding and an increase in accrued expenses. The Company’s growth in revenue of $93.0 million and gross profit of $41.0 million increased our outstanding trade receivables and inventories, which negatively impacted our cash provided by operating activities. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $13.2 million during 2020, primarily driven by capital expenditures of $10.5 million and a payment for intangible assets of $2.6 million related to our 2016 asset acquisition of video signal processing and management technologies. 45 Cash used in investing activities was $ 63. 8 million during 201 9 , primarily related to $ 53.1 million in cash outflows ( net of cash acquired of $ 4.2 million ) related to 2019 acquisitions . We also paid $ 10. 7 million for capital expenditures during 2019. Cash used in investing activities was $45.6 million during 2018, primarily related to $29.6 million in cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to acquisitions in 2018 and $14.7 million for capital expenditures. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2020. We expect to use approximately $21 million to $23 million in 2021 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $84.4 million during 2020, primarily due to $35.4 million in repayments of borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, $31.0 million payments of deferred and escrowed purchase price related to prior year acquisitions, $8.6 million of payroll tax payments upon vesting of share-based compensation awards, $5.5 million of repurchases of common shares, and $1.6 million of fees paid in connection with the First Amendment to our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Cash used in financing activities was $3.9 million during 2019, primarily due to $50.7 million repayment of term loan and revolving credit facility borrowings, $6.9 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, and $10.0 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by $66.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund cash considerations paid for 2019 acquisitions. We also paid $2.7 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into in December 2019. Cash used in financing activities was $60.2 million during 2018, primarily due to $30.8 million of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”), $9.2 million of contractual term loan payments, $65.4 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.6 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, and $5.9 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by $55.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited and the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum. In 2021, we are contractually required to pay $5.5 million in repayments under our term loan facility and $0.9 million in principal payments under our finance lease obligations. We exercised an option in December 2020 to purchase a facility for $9.2 million in Germany and expect to pay the related cash proceeds in March 2021. In addition, we may make optional repayments under our term loan and revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities. Pension Plans We maintain a defined benefit pension plan (the “U.K. Plan”) in Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan. Our funding policy is to fund the U.K. Plan based on actuarial methods as permitted by the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used (such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven assumptions). Each assumption used represents one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known, including actual return on plan assets and pension payments to plan participants. As of December 31, 2020, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.5 million. Based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, our annual contributions are expected to be approximately $1.0 million in 2021 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2020 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $5.1 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These 46 unrecognized tax benefits are further explained in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Contractual Obligations Total 2021 2022 - 2023 2024 - 2025 Thereafter (In thousands) Senior Credit Facilities (1) $ 204,840 $ 5,545 $ 11,090 $ 188,205 $ — Interest on Senior Credit Facilities (2) 15,389 4,050 7,851 3,488 — Finance leases (3) 17,292 10,060 1,837 1,908 3,487 Operating leases (4) 51,673 7,297 12,719 9,620 22,037 Purchase commitments (5) 54,568 54,416 152 — — U.K. pension plan (6) 1,511 1,013 498 — — Contingent considerations and earn-outs (7) 18,072 10,796 4,086 2,412 778 Total contractual obligations $ 363,345 $ 93,177 $ 38,233 $ 205,633 $ 26,302 (1) As of December 31, 2020, a total of $105.1 million term loan and $99.8 million revolving credit facility were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of approximately €1.1 million ($1.4 million) with the final installment of €68.7 million ($84.3 million) due upon maturity in December 2024. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity in December 2024. (2) For the purpose of this presentation, current interest rates on floating rate obligations (LIBOR plus applicable margin, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) were used for the remainder contractual life of both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Current commitment fee rate was used for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2020. (3) Future minimum lease payments under finance leases include the exercise price of an option to purchase a facility for $9.2 million in Germany in 2021. The Company exercised the option in December 2020 and expects to pay the related cash proceeds in March 2021. (4) These amounts primarily represent the gross amounts due for leased facilities. The amounts include payments due with respect to both active operating facilities and idle facilities that have been vacated. (5) Purchase commitments represent purchase obligations as of December 31, 2020. (6) Amounts shown represent expected funding contributions to reach an actuarial funded status where the market value of plan assets equals the projected benefit obligations as reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Company expects to continue its annual funding contributions thereafter, increasing 2.9% annually through 2022, until the value of plan assets is sufficient to settle the benefit obligations under the U.K. Plan in full. (7) These amounts represent the estimated contingent consideration and earn-out payments accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 that are expected to be paid between 2021 and 2027. The undiscounted range of the possible contingent consideration and earn-out payments is $2.7 million to $32.9 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2020, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, valuation of contingent consideration obligations, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. Revenue Recognition. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09” or “Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method. Under Topic 606, an entity 47 recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. R evenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606 includes the following five steps: ( i ) identify ing the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify ing the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determin ing the transaction price; (iv) allocat ing the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recogniz ing revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied . We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. We occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. We generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for our Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of the costs to service warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue. We expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. Inventories . Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, customs duties and trade tariffs on imported materials and components, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or trailing historical usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. 48 We typically grant two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). For EPS-PSUs, share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the level of achievement . When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, we recognize the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. The expense related to TSR-PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years , regardless of whether the target relative total s hare holder return is achieved . The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement in a large number of simulated scenarios. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model include risk-free interest rate and expected stock price volatility of both the Company’s common shares and the Russell 2000 index. Valuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Key assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and projected cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, technology obsolescence curves, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. We evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit as of the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit’s operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. 49 We evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible asset s or other long-lived asset s may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Factors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following: • significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; • changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; • long-term negative industry or economic trends; • technological changes or developments; • changes in competition; • loss of key customers or personnel; • adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; • significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and • the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. The occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified. The most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2020, using a quantitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 2020, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Goodwill Intangible Assets, net Property, Plant & Equipment, net Photonics $ 116,056 $ 59,900 $ 32,449 Vision 133,473 69,253 33,181 Precision Motion 36,451 19,368 8,762 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services — — 4,284 Total $ 285,980 $ 148,521 $ 78,676 Contingent Consideration. We record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date. Key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the contingent consideration include the following: • future revenue projections; • volatility of future revenue; and • discount rates used to present value the projected cash flows. On a quarterly basis, we revalue these assumptions and record the necessary adjustments to fair value in the consolidated statement of operations. Changes to contingent consideration obligation can result from adjustments to future revenue projections, volatility of future revenue and discount rates. 50 The assumptions used for the determin ation of the fair value of contingent consideration s include a significant amount of judgment, and changes in the underlying estimates could have a material impact on the amount of contingent consideration expense recorded in any given period. Accounting for Income Taxes . As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period in which such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made. In conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2020, we reversed valuation allowance of $0.7 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to current and forecasted taxable income. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $5.3 million, of which $5.0 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, we may need to recognize up to $0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $220.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liabilities on this temporary difference is approximately $3.9 million. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to product quality, labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statement. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us. 51 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We address market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect our operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposures are the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and with intercompany trading partners that are eliminated in consolidation. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign currency contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecasted transactions. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency contracts that hedge these exposures. We had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling $28.5 million and a fair value of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $1.6 million increase in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2020. By contrast, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $1.6 million decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2020. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. We have $204.8 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2020. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2020 would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $2.0 million. 52 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOVANTA INC. INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm – PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 54 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 56 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 57 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 58 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 59 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 60 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 61 53 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Novanta Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Changes in Accounting Principles As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 54 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Fair Value Measurements of the Contingent Consideration for ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. Acquisitions As described in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $8.0 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2020 related to the 2019 acquisitions of ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. The contingent consideration payments are payable annually based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from July 2019 through December 2026 for ARGES GmbH and from April 2019 through March 2022 for Ingenia-CAT, S.L. Management determines the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo valuation method. The following unobservable inputs were used by management to determine the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities: historical and projected revenues, revenue volatilities, cost of debt, and the discount rates. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value measurements of the contingent consideration for ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimated fair value measurements; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the Monte Carlo valuation method and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the projected revenues, revenue volatilities, and the discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s fair value measurements of the contingent consideration, including controls over management’s valuation method, significant assumptions and data. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value measurements of the contingent consideration, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo valuation method, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method, and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the projected revenues, revenue volatilities, and discount rates. Evaluating the assumptions related to projected revenues involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering current and past performance of the acquired businesses, consistency with external market data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s Monte Carlo valuation method and the revenue volatilities and discount rates assumptions. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 1, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. 55 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., applied on a consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Prior to January 10, 2017, the Company had an approximately 41 % ownership interest in Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”), a privately held company located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for $ 31.1 million in cash. As a result of this transaction, the Company’s ownership in Laser Quantum increased from approximately 41% to approximately 76 %. Since January 10, 2017, Laser Quantum has been consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On September 27, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $ 45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions, including estimated economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The accounting estimates assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accruals for contingent earnout agreements from business acquisitions, share-based compensation expense associated with performance-based restricted stock units, and the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material change to the consolidated financial statements related to these estimates as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 61 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 Accounts Receivable and Credit Losses Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses. The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of its products. The Company assesses each customer’s ability to pay by conducting a credit review which includes consideration of established credit rating or an internal assessment of the customer’s creditworthiness based on an analysis of their payment history when a credit rating is not available. The Company monitors the credit exposure through active review of customer balances. The Company’s expected loss methodology for accounts receivable is developed through consideration of factors including, but not limit to, historical collection experience, current customer credit ratings, current customer financial condition, current and future economic and market condition, and age of the receivables. Charges related to credit losses are included as selling, general and administrative expenses and are recorded in the period that the outstanding receivables are determined to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is certain that the receivable will not be recovered. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands): 2020 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 297 $ 321 $ 554 Addition to credit loss expense 158 33 66 Credit loss resulting from acquisitions — 120 — Write-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 207 ) ( 179 ) ( 295 ) Exchange rate changes 26 2 ( 4 ) Balance at end of year $ 274 $ 297 $ 321 Inventories Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product. The Company records a charge to cost of revenue for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation of its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from 3 to 30 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the lease terms, including any renewal period options that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Certain costs to develop software for internal use are capitalized when the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” are met. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities acquired in a business combination. Allocations of the purchase price are based upon a valuation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure their current fair values exceed their carrying values. The Company’s most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The fair values of intangible assets are based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of the acquired companies and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the 62 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews the useful life assumptions, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived , ” on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Costs associated with patent and intellectual property applications, renewals or extensions are typically expensed as incurred. The Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is at least one level below the reportable segments. Impairment Charges Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —Goodwill and Other.” The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of the Company’s reporting units to the estimated fair value of these reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method with a weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the second quarter, and more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company will also reassess the continuing classification of these intangible assets as indefinite-lived when circumstances change such that the useful life may no longer be considered indefinite. The fair values of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using the relief from royalty method, based on forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The carrying amounts of definite-lived long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value is generally determined by comparison of the asset group’s carrying value to its undiscounted future cash flows. When this test indicates a potential for impairment, a fair value assessment is performed. Once an impairment is determined and measured, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Revenue Recognition See Note 3 for the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are included in current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of the Company’s lease arrangements include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. 63 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. Research and Development and Engineering Costs Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. These costs are expensed as incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company records the expense associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company also grants two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP earnings per share performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the level of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. Share-based compensation expense associated with TSR-PSUs is based on the grant-date fair value, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model, and is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and were not material for 2020, 2019 and 2018. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. Accounting for Income Taxes The asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is 64 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 more likely than not that some or all of the related tax benefits will not be realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released. The majority of the Company’s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of Canada. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. Consequently, the Company generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that the Company intends to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses foreign currency contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The time duration of these foreign currency contracts approximates the underlying foreign currency transaction exposures, generally less than three months. These contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, including (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2019-12 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 65 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference rate reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting.” ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. Upon issuance. Adoption of ASU 2020-04 is elective. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2020-04 to be material to its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation - retirement benefits - defined benefit plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure framework – Change to the disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans.” ASU 2018-14 provides minor changes to the disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans. Fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 The Company adopted ASU 2018-14 during the fourth quarter of 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. 3. Revenue In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASU 2014-09 has been applied to those contracts which had not been completed as of January 1, 2018 and all new contracts entered into by the Company subsequent to January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have an impact on the Company’s accumulated deficit. The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. 66 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated warranty cost is recorded in cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, contract liabilities were $ 6.5 million and $ 3.6 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily due to cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations offset by $ 3.3 million of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 18 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 67 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 4. Business Combinations 2019 Acquisitions On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.7 million ($ 73.2 million), including net working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124 thousand Novanta common shares issued at closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.8 million ($ 27.7 million) deferred cash consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from August 2019 through December 2026, with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. In 2020, the Company paid € 25.0 million to the former owner of ARGES in deferred cash consideration and to settle working capital. The addition of ARGES complements and expands the Company’s existing portfolio of lasers and laser beam steering solutions capabilities within the Photonics reportable segment. On June 5, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs in the medical market. The purchase price of $ 21.9 million, net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and a $ 21.0 million borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Med X Change complements and broadens the range of technology capabilities within the Company’s Vision reportable segment by providing its medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of € 14.3 million ($ 16.2 million), net of working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 8.5 million ($ 9.6 million) cash consideration and € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022, with the first payment due in the second quarter of 2020. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. The Ingenia purchase and sale agreement requires € 0.8 million ($ 0.9 million) of the purchase price to be held back by the Company for indemnification of certain representations and warranties claims by the Company until the expiration of the holdback agreement in October 2020 . The Company released the indemnification holdback in the fourth quarter of 2020. The addition of Ingenia enhances the Company’s strategic position in precision motion control industry by enabling it to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. The acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change and Ingenia have been accounted for as business combinations. Purchase price allocation is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuation techniques with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. 68 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 ARGES The final purchase price for ARGES was allocated as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,430 Inventories 7,129 Property, plant and equipment 14,095 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 42,951 Other assets 2,244 Total assets acquired 95,721 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 5,510 Other liabilities 14,462 Total liabilities assumed 22,570 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 73,151 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 69,992 Less: contingent consideration 7,870 Less: issuance of common shares 10,900 Less: deferred cash consideration 27,664 Initial cash purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 23,558 The fair value of intangible assets for ARGES is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 11,355 15 years Customer relationships 11,800 15 years Trademarks and trade names 1,225 10 years Backlog 333 5 months Total $ 24,713 Customer relationships and backlog for ARGES were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Developed technology and trademarks and trade names for ARGES were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 24.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 43.0 million of goodwill. As the ARGES acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) expected future benefits from advancing the Company’s photonic-based product roadmap through the addition of R&D capabilities from ARGES; (ii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (iii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iv) cost improvements due to the integration of ARGES’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ARGES were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 31, 2019. ARGES contributed revenues of $ 4.9 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and purchased intangible assets of $ 2.2 million. 69 NOVANTA INC.

The Company recorded $ 13.4 million of goodwill from these acquisitions. Goodwill amounting to $ 6.2 million from the Med X Change acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill amounting to $ 7.2 million from the Ingenia acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) the ability of Med X Change and Ingenia to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) their ability to grow the businesses 70 NOVANTA INC.

Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 Level 3: Unobservable inputs 74 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million ($ 11.1 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on revenue performance through December 31, 2020 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 to 2026, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 4.1 million ($ 5.1 million), of which € 0.4 million ($ 0.4 million) is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2021 and is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The remaining fair value is reported as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the former shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million ($ 9.0 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) as of the acquisition date was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. The first payment of € 1.0 million ($ 1.1 million) was made in the second quarter of 2020. Based on revenue performance through December 31, 2020 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2021 to 2022, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.3 million ($ 2.9 million), of which € 1.3 million ($ 1.6 million) is expected to be paid in the second quarter of 2021 and is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The remaining fair value is reported as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying assets. The first payment of € 2.4 million ($ 2.6 million) was made in the first quarter of 2020. Based on revenue performance as of December 31, 2020 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal year 2021, the fair value of the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to € 2.9 million ($ 3.6 million), of which € 1.9 million ($ 2.3 million) will be paid in the first quarter of 75 NOVANTA INC.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of December 31, 2020, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 28.5 million and a net gain of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 12.4 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. 77 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized aggregate net gains of $ 1.3 million, $ 0.8 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, from the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts, which were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 9. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, if any, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Prior to the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum in September 2018, the Company recognized changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period was also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. However, for both basic and diluted earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments were included in the calculation of the numerator for 2018. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units and certain non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders and non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation after the performance targets have been achieved. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (in thousands, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2020 (1) 2019 (2) 2018 (3) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 44,521 $ 40,773 $ 51,095 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — — ( 1,986 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 44,521 40,773 49,109 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment — — 1,781 Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 44,521 $ 40,773 $ 50,890 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,144 35,030 34,913 Dilutive potential common shares 510 516 560 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,654 35,546 35,473 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 13 41 4 Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 1.27 $ 1.16 $ 1.46 Diluted $ 1.25 $ 1.15 $ 1.43 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2020, 45 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2020. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2019, 46 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2019. 78 NOVANTA INC.

The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024 . The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of May 19, 2016. On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and exercised a portion of the uncommitted accordion feature. The First Amendment increased the revolving credit facility commitment under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement by $ 145.0 million, from $ 350.0 million to $ 495.0 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $ 200.0 million for potential future expansion. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25 % to 1.25 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25 % and 2.25 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20 % and 0.40 % per annum, determined by reference to the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including, among others: (i) limitations on restricted payments, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, provided that the Company and its subsidiaries may repurchase their equity interests so long as, immediately after giving effect to the repurchase, the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio is no more than 3.25 :1.00, with a step up to 3.75 :1.00 for four consecutive quarters following an acquisition with an aggregate consideration greater than or equal to $50.0 million, and the satisfaction of other customary conditions; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. 81 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, such as maintaining a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 :1 . 00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.50 :1 . 00 . The maximum consolidated leverage ratio will increase to 4.00 :1 . 00 for four consecutive quarters following an acquisition with an aggregate consideration greater than or equal to $ 50.0 million.

The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at anytime through December 2024 . The Company may be required to prepay outstanding loans under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions and incurrences of certain debt. At the election of the Company, and so long as no default shall have occurred, the Company may reinvest all, or any portion, of the net proceeds from such asset dispositions or incurrences of debt within a year. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ 395.2 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. Excluding commitment fees, the weighted average interest rate for the Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 1.53 % as of December 31, 2020. The commitment fee rate for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility was approximately 0.25 % as of December 31, 2020. Guarantees The Senior Credit Facilities is guaranteed by Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Med X Change, Inc., Novanta Medical Technologies Corp., W.O.M. World of Medicine USA, Inc., Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited (collectively, “Guarantors”). Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest and fees under the Senior Credit Facilities, when due and payable, whether at maturity, by required prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise. In addition, Guarantors guarantee the due and punctual payment, fees and interest on the overdue principal of the Senior Credit Facilities and the due and punctual performance of all obligations of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees that in the event of any extension, renewal, amendment, refinancing or modification of any of the Senior Credit Facilities, amounts due will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities or any collections from, or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor of its pro rata share based on the adjusted net assets of each Guarantor. If at any time any payment of any of the obligations of the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, a Guarantor or otherwise, the Guarantees will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not been made. Each Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee and its obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) the Guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; or (ii) payment in full of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facilities and all other obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Guarantors could be required to make under the Guarantee is the principal amount of the Senior Credit Facilities plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, as of December 31, 2020, the Guarantors were not expected to be required to perform under the Guarantee. 82 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Deferred Financing Costs In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the First Amendment, the Company capitalized an additional $ 4.3 million of deferred financing costs. The Company allocated these costs between the term loan and the revolving credit facility based on the maximum borrowing capacity and amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. Previously unamortized deferred financing costs will continue to be amortized. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs was $ 1.0 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 1.0 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value of Debt As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 12. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2021 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Capital Shares The authorized capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of common shares without nominal or par value. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, and to share ratably in the Company’s assets legally available for distribution to shareholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common shares have no redemption or conversion rights. Common Share Repurchases The Company’s Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at the Company’s discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to the Company’s employees and directors, the plans do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2013 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 10.0 million worth of common shares. During 2018, the Company repurchased 89 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.9 million at an average price of $ 65.43 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 385 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 25.97 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had completed the 2013 Repurchase Plan. In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2020, the Company repurchased 65 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.5 million at an average price of $ 84.55 per share. During 2019, the Company repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 83.71 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. The Company had $ 9.5 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2020. 85 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of common shares, effective after the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $ 59.5 million available under the 2018 and 2020 share repurchase plans for future share repurchases. In an effort to preserve cash in light of the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has temporarily suspended repurchases under the share repurchase plans since April 2020. 2010 Incentive Award Plan In November 2010, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan under which the Company may grant share-based compensation awards to employees, consultants and directors. In May 2014, the Company’s shareholders approved the amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan and, in July 2016, the Company approved a further amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the “Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan”). The maximum number of shares which can be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan is 4,398,613 , subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and stock payments (collectively referred to as “Awards”). The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for specific limits on the number of shares with respect to Awards that may be granted to any person during any calendar year and the amount of cash that can be paid with respect to Awards to any one person during any calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan will expire and no further Awards may be granted after April 9, 2024 . As of December 31, 2020, there were 535,361 shares available for future awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. Shares subject to Awards that have expired, forfeited or settled in cash, or repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the awardee may be added back to the number of shares available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan and may be granted as new Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares will not be added back to the number of shares available for grant: (a) shares that are used to pay the exercise price for an option, (b) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to any Award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to the extent they exceed the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the tax liability based on minimum withholding rates, (c) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, (d) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and (e) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares issued to satisfy Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan may be previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares repurchased on the open market. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in operating income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 14,550 $ 8,361 $ 6,997 Research and development and engineering 3,301 497 438 Cost of revenue 4,684 482 211 Restructuring and acquisition related costs 584 — 68 Total share-based compensation expense $ 23,119 $ 9,340 $ 7,714 The expense recorded during each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included $ 1.0 million, $ 0.9 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. 86 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 On April 15, 2020 , the Company issued to all employees , other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Chief Accounting Officer, a special one-time restricted stock unit grant at a total fair value of $ 14.4 million in the aggregate. The restricted stock units vested o n February 16, 2021 . As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s outstanding equity awards for which compensation expense will be recognized in the future consisted of time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units granted under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Company expects to record an aggregate share-based compensation expense of $ 18.0 million, net of estimated forfeitures, over a weighted average period of 0.96 years subsequent to December 31, 2020, for all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2020. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued to employees with vesting periods ranging from three years to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 162 thousand and 187 thousand DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities during 2020 relating to restricted and deferred stock units issued and outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Restricted and Deferred Stock Units (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2019 453 $ 39.74 Granted 295 $ 85.96 Vested ( 111 ) $ 52.27 Forfeited ( 12 ) $ 78.65 Unvested at December 31, 2020 625 $ 58.79 0.67 years $ 73,922 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 605 $ 57.85 0.67 years $ 71,545 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 118.22 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2020 due to the fact that the restricted stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. The total fair value of restricted stock units and deferred stock units that vested in 2020, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the day of vesting, was $ 10.4 million. Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of a three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over the three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. 87 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period . The table below summarizes activities during 2020 relating to performance-based stock awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Performance Stock Units (1) (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (2) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2019 152 $ 57.95 Granted 50 $ 111.47 Performance adjustment (3) 60 $ 28.80 Vested ( 120 ) $ 28.80 Forfeited — $ — Unvested at December 31, 2020 142 $ 88.99 1.07 years $ 16,437 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 150 $ 91.13 1.07 years $ 17,724 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target. The number of shares vested reflects the number of shares earned and issued during the year. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned was approximately 283 thousand. (2) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 118.22 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2020 due to the fact that the performance stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. (3) The amount shown represents performance adjustments for performance-based awards granted on February 28, 2017. These units vested at 200 % during 2020 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS and applicable relative TSR performance conditions during the performance period of fiscal years 2017 through 2019. The total fair value of PSUs that vested in 2020, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting, was $ 10.8 million. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2020 Grant-date stock price $ 96.28 Expected volatility 34.25 % Risk-free interest rate 1.35 % Expected annual dividend yield — Weighted average fair value $ 126.65 Stock Options On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 193 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vested ratably on the anniversary date of the grant date over a three-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of these stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options included the expected option term, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected term of the options, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company recognized the compensation expense of stock options on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. No stock options were granted during 2020. 88 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The following table shows stock options that were outstanding, exercisable and expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 and the related weighted average exercise price, weighted average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value: Number of Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (In years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Stock options outstanding 60 $ 14.13 5.25 $ 6,259 Stock options exercisable 60 $ 14.13 5.25 $ 6,259 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the closing market price of $ 118.22 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2020 and the exercise price of the stock options . The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2020, based on the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 1.0 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.2 million. The Company did no t record any income tax deductions from the stock options exercised in 2020 as these were non-qualified stock options. 14. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution employee retirement savings plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. The Company matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis of percentages specified in each plan. The Company’s matching contributions to the plans were $ 4.2 million, $ 4.4 million and $ 3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Defined Benefit Plan The Company maintains a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003. Benefits under the U.K. Plan were based on the participants’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen in 2003, adjusted for inflation. The Company continues to fund the plan in accordance with the pension regulations in the U.K. The net periodic pension cost is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following components (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Components of the net periodic pension cost: Interest cost $ 736 $ 971 $ 939 Expected return on plan assets ( 1,340 ) ( 1,671 ) ( 1,717 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 686 957 826 Amortization of prior service cost 29 29 — Net periodic pension cost $ 111 $ 286 $ 48 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Weighted-average discount rate 1.9 % 2.7 % 2.4 % Weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.6 % 5.1 % 4.8 % 89 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were as follows: December 31, 2020 2019 Weighted-average discount rate 1.2 % 1.9 % Rate of inflation 2.6 % 2.5 % The discount rates used are derived from (AA) corporate bonds that have maturities approximating the terms of the pension obligations under the U.K. Plan. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the historical performance of the major asset classes held by the U.K. Plan and current forecasts of future rates of return for these asset classes. The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.K. Plan (in thousands): December 31, 2020 2019 Change in benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 40,456 $ 36,882 Interest cost 736 971 Actuarial (gains) losses (1) 5,410 3,005 Benefits paid ( 1,111 ) ( 1,696 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 1,709 1,294 Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 47,200 $ 40,456 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 47,200 $ 40,456 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 38,983 $ 33,124 Actual return on plan assets 5,170 5,410 Employer contributions 988 894 Benefits paid ( 1,111 ) ( 1,696 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 1,659 1,251 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 45,689 $ 38,983 Funded status at end of year $ ( 1,511 ) $ ( 1,473 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost: Net actuarial losses at beginning of year $ ( 9,706 ) $ ( 11,120 ) Net actuarial gains (losses) during the year ( 1,580 ) 734 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income before income taxes 715 986 Foreign currency exchange rate changes ( 387 ) ( 306 ) Net actuarial losses $ ( 10,958 ) $ ( 9,706 ) (1) Fiscal year 2020 and 2019 actuarial losses in the U.K. Plan primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate assumptions. 90 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The funded status of the U.K. Plan is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The following table reflects the total expected benefit payments to plan participants for each of the next five years and the following five years in aggregate and have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Amount 2021 $ 1,252 2022 1,109 2023 1,211 2024 1,588 2025 1,439 2026-2030 10,015 Total $ 16,614 In the U.K., funding valuations are conducted every three years in order to determine the future level of contributions. Based on the results of the most recent valuation, the Company’s annual contributions will be approximately $ 1.0 million in 2021 and will increase by 2.9 % per year thereafter. Fair Value of Plan Assets The trustee of the U.K. Plan has the fiduciary responsibilities to manage the plan assets in consultation with the Company. The overall objective is to invest plan assets in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve balanced growth through a combination of investments in equities for long-term growth and investments in debt instruments that match a portion of the expected future benefit payments and to maintain adequate liquidity to make pension payments to pensioners.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 In determining its income tax provisions, the Company calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate jurisdiction. The Company then considered a number of factors, including positive and negative evidence related to the realization of its deferred tax assets, to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to its deferred tax assets. In 2020, the Company reversed valuation allowance of $ 0.7 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to current and forecasted taxable income. In 2019, the Company reversed valuation allowance of $ 0.5 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income generated during the year. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $ 0.4 million valuation allowance associated with an increase in deferred tax assets in Canada. Valuation allowance continues to be provided on the remaining balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not that they will be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.1 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $ 0.9 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037 ; and $ 2.1 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.1 million and $ 0.6 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.8 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $ 0.3 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037 ; and $ 3.5 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.2 million and $ 0.5 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 3.3 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $ 1.4 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $ 1.3 million will expire through 2035 and $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $ 1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 1.2 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 2.8 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $ 0.9 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $ 0.8 million will expire through 2034 and $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $ 1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 1.2 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $ 220.4 million as of December 31, 2020. The estimated unrecognized income tax and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $ 3.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 5.3 million, of which $ 5.0 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $ 0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all significant income tax uncertainties. 94 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 The reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 4,089 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 394 Additions for tax positions of prior years 655 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 69 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 239 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 105 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 4,725 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 727 Additions for tax positions of prior years 5 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 31 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 497 ) Settlements with tax authorities - Balance at December 31, 2019 4,929 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 476 Additions for tax positions of prior years 356 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 5 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 498 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 5,258 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax provision. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $ 0.7 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $ 0.2 million, $ 0.1 million and $ 0.1 million, respectively, of expense for an increase in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company files income tax returns in Canada, the U.S., and various foreign jurisdictions. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. or foreign income tax examinations, including transfer pricing tax audits, by tax authorities for the years before 2010. The Company’s income tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the following countries for the following periods under the appropriate statute of limitations: United States 2017 - Present Canada 2017 - Present United Kingdom 2019 - Present Germany 2016 - Present The Netherlands 2014 - Present China 2011 - Present Japan 2015 - Present 95 NOVANTA INC.

This program is focused on reducing operating complexity in the Company, including reducing infrastructure costs and streamlining the Company’s operating model to better serve its customers. In addition, the program will be focused on cost reduction actions that improve gross margins for the overall company. In 2020, the Company recorded $ 2.7 million in severance and other costs in connection with the 2020 restructuring program. The Company anticipates completing the 2020 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expects to incur additional restructuring charges of $ 4.0 million to $ 5.0 million related to the 2020 restructuring program in the next twelve months.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2020, the Company had purchase commitments primarily for inventory purchases of $ 54.6 million. These purchase commitments are expected to be incurred as follows: $ 54.4 million in 2021 and $ 0.2 million in 2022. Legal Proceedings In April 2020, the Company received notification of an arbitration demand filed with the American Arbitration Association against a business acquired by the Company in June 2019. The arbitration demand was filed by a contract counterparty to a joint product development agreement entered into by the business before the Company acquired it. The arbitration demand alleges breach of contract and other claims arising out of allegations that the business failed to engage in required marketing activities for the product developed under the joint product development agreement. The claimant is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, lost profits and other relief. The Company believes that the claims are without merit and no amount has been accrued for in the consolidated financial statements. The Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 98 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2020 On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties The Company maintains financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. From time to time, certain of these instruments may subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk whereby one institution may hold a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents, or one customer may represent a large portion of the accounts receivable balances. There was no significant concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s position in trade accounts receivable as no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is generally minimized because of the diversification of the Company’s operations, as well as its large customer base and its geographic dispersion. Certain of the components and materials included in the Company’s products are currently obtained from single source suppliers. There can be no assurance that a disruption of the supply of such components and materials would not create substantial manufacturing delays and additional cost to the Company. The Company’s operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, rapidly changing technologies, and international operations. 18. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are included in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in those certifications. Those certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures as of December 31, 2020 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), as of December 31, 2020. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making their assessment, our management utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework , issued by COSO in 2013, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2019, the medical market accounted for approximately 55% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2019, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 45% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the 6 financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market . Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory stocking requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital . Customers We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. Customers of our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include a large number of OEM customers who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. We also sell a very small portion of our products directly to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on a number of factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain of our products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. Seasonality While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines are impacted in the first quarter by the seasonal spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting cycles. Backlog As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our consolidated backlog was approximately $243.1 million and $234.4 million, respectively. The majority of orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve-month period. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. Manufacturing Manufacturing functions are performed internally when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process or for cost related reasons while some of the less critical portions are outsourced to third parties. To the extent it makes financial sense, we will consider outsourcing additional portions of the production process. Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Wackersdorf, Germany; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse and Rochester, New York; San Jose, California; Bradenton, Florida; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Rocklin, California; Poole and Cambridge, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Many of our products are produced in manufacturing facilities certified under ISO 9001 certification, while the majority of our products manufactured for the medical market are produced in factories under ISO 13485 certification. The manufacturing facilities for our medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are ISO 14001 certified. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders, imaging informatics and medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In addition, if these medical devices are classified as Class II devices, a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and approval by the FDA is required. 7 Marketing, Sales and Distribution We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. Sales outside of the United States are largely based on a direct sales force, but occasionally are sold through distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Competition The markets in which we compete are dynamic and highly competitive. While no single company competes with us across the breadth of our product offerings, we face a fragmented competitive landscape, with competitors for particular product categories and individual application areas. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small private firms, which produce a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments. Competitors for our products are fragmented by particular product category, and the individual markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our major competitors by reportable segments include, among others: Photonics: SCANLAB, Coherent, and Cobolt. Vision: Barco, Omron Microscan, FSN Medical Technologies, and HID Global. Precision Motion: Renishaw, HEIDENHAIN, Physik Instrument, and Allied Motion Technologies. Competitive factors in our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include product performance, price, quality and reliability, features, compatibility of products with existing systems, technical support, product breadth, market presence and our overall reputation. We believe that our products offer a number of competitive advantages, and the breadth of technologies we offer give us deep market application knowledge to better serve our customers’ needs and distinguish us from our competitors. Ultimately, our ability to deliver high-quality products timely when the customer needs them presents the biggest threat to our competitiveness. Raw Materials, Components and Supplies Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Patents and Intellectual Property We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold a number of registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole. 8 We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Resources As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we employed 2,290 and 2,262 employees, respectively. We also utilize temporary and contract personnel that are not included in these headcount numbers. Government Regulation Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Such rules and regulations are subject to change by the governing agencies and we monitor those changes closely. Environmental Regulations Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)). Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment. Medical Device Regulations Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the FDA. We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and local authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products. FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s 9 requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements. 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Post-market Regulations After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: • establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; • QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; • labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; • FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; • clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices; • medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; • correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; • requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); • the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and • post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device. 10 We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaint s file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: • warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; • recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; • refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; • withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; • refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or • criminal prosecution. Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. These laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the federal government information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. For further information regarding other healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products.” Other Information We maintain a website with the address https://www.novanta.com.

Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. Risks Relating to our Business Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. In particular, diminished growth expectations, economic and political uncertainty in Europe as Britain negotiates the terms of its withdrawal from the EU, and ongoing related negotiations, as well as political and economic uncertainty in the U.S. adversely impacted our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels, and have reduced the demand for our products in 2019. Continued or worsening conditions in these or other markets could further reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Our business depends significantly upon our customers’ capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations. Certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment markets, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. It is difficult to predict the timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We have experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. For example, in 2019, our sales into the advanced industrial end market declined as a result of a wide spread downturn in this end market that is continuing. We cannot predict when slowdowns will recur or that the impact of such slowdowns will be more or less significant compared to historical fluctuations. Our business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility toward future business declines. During a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand could prompt customers to look for alternative sources of supply or leave our customers without a supply, both of which events could harm our reputation and make it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business. In periods of weak demand, we may be required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase or manufacture inventories of products that we are unable to sell. 12 The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate and to manage transitions to new product innovations. Technology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers’ requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business. We cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. If any of our new or enhanced products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, or if our competitors release similar products or enhancements at the same time that are more widely accepted by our customers, our revenue and results of operations for one or more reporting periods could be adversely affected. If we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. Our research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including: • changing product specifications and customer requirements; • inability to manufacture new products cost effectively; • difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; • changing market or competitive product requirements; and • unanticipated engineering complexities. New products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, and may have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be difficulty in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful. Any of these adverse developments could lead to loss of market share and inability to achieve our anticipated revenue growth targets. Customer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Changes in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include: • fluctuations in our customers’ businesses; • timing and recognition of revenues from customer orders; • timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors; • availability of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors; • decisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products; • changes in the prices of our products or of our competitors’ products; and • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We received in the past, and may receive in the future, several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers’ businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods. 13 D elay s in shipment s near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period. In addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. As a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial, customer and employee information. Like other global companies, we have experienced threats to data and systems, including by perpetrators of random or targeted malicious cyberattacks, computer viruses, malware, worms, bot attacks or other destructive or disruptive software and attempts to misappropriate customer information and cause system failures and disruptions. Certain other events could also result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement action, or other liability risks that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our information technology systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security of our information technology systems, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws, regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business and financial results. Legislation in various countries around the world with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection is rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, has caused more stringent data protection requirements in the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects how their personal information is to be used; imposes limitations on retention of personal data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those EU jurisdictions where we have business operations or are otherwise subject to the GDPR. Certain breaches of the GDPR requirements could result in substantial fines, which can be up to four percent of worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well as potential civil claims, including class action type litigation where individuals suffered harm. Similarly, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. Any liability from our failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our GDPR compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts in general. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or to comply with the GDPR or other applicable regimes. 14 As we transact a portion of our sales, and maintain significant cash balances, in foreign currencies, changes in interest rates, credit ratings or foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U. S., the U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds or Japanese Yen, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors. Additionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks. Our reliance on international operations in foreign countries subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 59% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including: • foreign exchange rate fluctuations; • increases in shipping costs; • longer customer payment cycles; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • use of incompatible systems and equipment; • problems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures; • trade tariffs; • trade barriers and export/import controls; • transportation delays and interruptions; • increased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights; • government currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings; • compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including those that potentially conflict with other jurisdictions; • the impact of recessionary foreign economies; and • natural disasters, wars, health epidemics and acts of terrorism. We also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct, which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws. Our facilities or operations could be adversely affected by events outside of our control, such as health epidemics. We may be impacted by health epidemics or other events outside of our control. For example, beginning in late 2019, a strain of novel coronavirus surfaced in China. In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” prompting precautionary government-imposed travel restrictions and temporary closures of business operations. We have manufacturing, sales, and service offices in China and has significant direct and indirect customer exposure and supply chain exposure to the China market. Our facility in Suzhou, China was closed for a brief period of time as a result of a local government mandate, before it reopened in February 2020. The business interruption has negatively impacted our near-term results and may negatively impact our long-term results, depending on the length of the disruption. These disruptions have come in the form of part shortages related to our supply chain, labor shortages, and disruptions in demand from our customers in and outside of China, which will negatively affect our revenue and profitability. At this point in time, there is significant uncertainty 15 relating to the extent of the impact of the novel coronavirus on our business and potential impacts on our business in the future. Infections may become more widespread, including to other countries where we have operations, and factory closures and travel restrictions may remain or worsen, all of which would worsen the negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations . Increased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the U.S. leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business. We are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China, Southeast Asia and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries and public health crises could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products, or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property. Increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 59% of our revenues were from customers outside of the U.S. We also manufacture certain of our products and purchase a portion of our raw materials and components from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and other countries have escalated in recent years. U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports have been followed by retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are or were subject to these tariffs, which has increased our manufacturing costs and could make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been and may in the future be subject to retaliatory tariffs in China, which increases our cost and makes our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. In addition, the U.S. administration previously threatened to impose tariffs on all products imported from China, which would impact all of our products and supplies imported from China to the U.S.; and the Chinese government threatened to levy additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods. If these were to occur, we may not be able to mitigate the impacts of these tariffs, and our business, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain other foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making our products uncompetitive to similar products not subjected to such import tariffs. Although a temporary agreement has been reached between the U.S. and Chinese governments to cease further escalation of trade tariffs, there is no guarantee that any of the existing tariffs will be repealed or reduced. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufacturing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU and the actions of the current U.S. government may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of our common shares. We are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations in the U.K., Germany and China. Following a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the U.K. government, the U.K. withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and entered into a transition period during which it will continue its ongoing and complex negotiations with the European Union relating to the future trading relationship between the parties. Significant political and economic uncertainty remains about whether the terms of the relationship will differ materially from the terms before the withdrawal, as well as about the possibility that a so-called “no deal” separation will occur if negotiations are not completed by the end of the transition period. These developments in turn may increase our costs and inhibit our sales of products, mobility of our personnel and our access to capital. The policies of the current U.S. government regarding U.S. trade, tax and health care policies, among other things, have led to substantial uncertainty in global financial markets. The current U.S. government has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, has re-negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and has made various comments suggesting the possible re-negotiation of, or withdrawal from, other trade agreements, has imposed significant tariffs on imports from China and other countries, and has suggested the potential imposition of other significant new import barriers. The current U.S. government has also enacted comprehensive tax law reform and attempted to repeal the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), and may continue to seek repeal of the PPACA. These developments and the lack of clarity regarding future U.S. tax, trade and health care policies have created significant uncertainty that could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any major changes in these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares. Because of the global nature of our business, and our strategy to increase our sales to the medical market, our business may be particularly impacted by any major changes in U.S. trade, tax and health care policies. 16 Others may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights. Our future success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any application filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operate or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors. Our operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties. We have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. If a successful claim were brought against us and we were found to have infringed a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement. We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences. Some of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses. As part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change, Ingenia, Zettlex, WOM, Laser Quantum and ThingMagic, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management’s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. Further, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of acquired businesses will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate operations into our businesses. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their 17 profitability, in which case our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. If we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expenses and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings. We may need to take additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions for a variety of reasons, including deterioration in global economic conditions or significant declines in demand for our products. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. Product defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors’ products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation. We produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors’ products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single source of supply. If a single source supplier decides to stop producing a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is otherwise delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such decisions or delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders. In addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders. 18 If we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on multiple factors, including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers. Production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U.K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. If production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were disrupted by a natural disaster, health epidemic, and act of terrorism or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of: • mistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations; • changing process technologies; • ramping production; • installing new equipment at our manufacturing facilities; • implementing new information technology systems; • shortage of key components; and • loss of electricity or employees’ access to the manufacturing facilities due to man-made and natural disasters. From time to time, we determine to consolidate certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping delays, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the key package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers. We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Some of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive) and to obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could: • take a significant period of time; • require substantial resources; 19 • involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; • require changes to products; and • result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. In addition, on April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (the “MDR”) which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. As the MDR becomes effective on May 25, 2020, new medical devices will have to meet requirements of the MDR in order to be placed in the European market after the effective date. Devices holding a certificate from a European Notified Body under the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC) have an additional grace period and may continue to be placed on the market until May 26, 2024. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU member states, the regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EU member state laws implementing them) in all EU member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EU member states. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will, however, only become applicable three years after publication. Once applicable, the new regulations will, among other things: • strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; • establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; • improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; • set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and • strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. We face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and EU competent authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future changes. From time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the regulation of medical devices. The FDA may also change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our future products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently cleared products on a timely basis. Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our 20 products. Any new statutes, regulations , or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs , lengthen regulatory review time for , or make it more difficult to obtain approval for, the manufactur ing , market ing or distribut ion of our products. Such changes could, among other things, require additional testing prior to obtaining clearance or approval, changes to manufacturing methods, recall, replacement or discontinuance of our products, or require additional record keeping. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and operations are subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties. Our products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign and U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sale, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include: • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; • federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors; • the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPPA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; • HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; • the federal physician “Sunshine Act” requirements under PPACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicated Services (the “CMS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; • state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payors, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Efforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 21 Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products. Several of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurs, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. Various elements of healthcare reforms, such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots, and other provisions, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered and may have material adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in government regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could result in significant costs. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or the recycling of products we manufacture. We are subject to regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to regulatory fines. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability. If we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on centralized information systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new or upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become familiar with the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information 22 to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of upgrades and new ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2019, we had $440.9 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets. Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers’ failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition. Our reliance upon third party distribution channels subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control. We sell many of our products through resellers, distributors, and system integrators. As these third parties tend to have more limited financial resources than OEM and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk. Any downturn in the business of our resellers, distributors, and systems integrators would in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales also depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Taxes Novanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation. Novanta, Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta, Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends, royalties and certain types of interest. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, and/or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods. Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure 23 We may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, maintaining or expanding research and development projects, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt of $224.6 million under our amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and $226.6 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares. Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had $224.6 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: • reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, changes in the general economic environment, and market changes in the industries in which we operate; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt. Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder. The market price for our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by: • quarterly variations in our results of operations; • changes in earnings estimates by analysts; • conditions in the markets we serve; or • general market, political or economic conditions. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares. Risks Relating to Our Internal Controls If we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business. While our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future. 24 If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. As part of our growth strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take for our recently acquired businesses or any businesses that we may acquire in the future. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls in order to make such improvements. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources, including management time and attention, from other activities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. 25 Item 2. Properties Our principal owned and leased properties as of December 31, 2019 are listed in the table below. Location Principal Use Current Segment Approximate Square Feet Owned/Leased Bedford, Massachusetts, United States Manufacturing, R&D, Marketing, Sales and Administration Photonics, Precision Motion & Corporate 147,000 Leased; expires in 2031 Ludwigsstadt, Germany Manufacturing Vision 105,000 Owned Suzhou, People’s Republic of China Manufacturing, R&D, Marketing, Sales and Administration Photonics, Vision & Precision Motion 55,000 Leased; expires in 2023 Berlin, Germany R&D, Marketing, Sales and Administration Vision 51,000 Leased; expires in 2026 Additional manufacturing, research and development, sales, service and logistics sites are located in California, Washington, Florida, New York, Arizona and Oregon within the United States, and in Germany, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Japan, China, Spain and Italy. These additional facilities cover approximately 540,000 square feet, of which approximately 374,000 square feet are leased and approximately 166,000 square feet are owned, and are used by our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. We consider our facilities suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used and do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. We believe all of our properties have been properly-maintained. Item 3. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 26 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Shares, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Market Information The Company’s common shares, no par value, are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “NOVT”. Holders As of the close of business on February 20, 2020, there were approximately 37 holders of record of the Company’s common shares. Since many of the common shares are registered in “nominee” or “street” names, the Company believes that the total number of beneficial owners is considerably higher. Dividend Policy The Company has never declared or paid cash dividends on its common shares and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchaser In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of the Company’s common shares. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of our common shares. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Since the adoption of the share repurchase plan, the Company repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million at an average price of $83.71 per share. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of the Company’s common shares (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”), following the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan. While the 2020 Repurchase Plan is intended to generally offset dilution from equity awards to the Company’s employees and directors, the plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of our common shares. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2020 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to repurchases of the Company’s common shares under the 2018 Repurchase Plan for the periods indicated. Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs September 28 - November 1, 2019 15,600 $ 83.47 15,600 $ 17,012,575 November 2 - November 29, 2019 13,200 $ 84.07 13,200 $ 15,902,877 November 30 - December 31, 2019 9,964 $ 90.61 9,964 $ 15,000,088 Total 38,764 38,764 27 Performance Graph The following graph compares the cumulative total return on the Company’s common shares with the cumulative total return on the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index for the period from December 31, 2014 through December 31, 2019. The comparison assumes an investment of $100 is made on December 31, 2014 in the Company’s common shares and in each of the indices and, in the case of the indices, it also assumes reinvestment of all dividends. The performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the medical market and the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2019, the medical market accounted for approximately 55% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, growth rates of surgical procedures, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, changes in technology requirements, timing of OEM customers’ product development and new product launches, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2019, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 45% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 31 Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing components and sub-systems to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, laser additive manufacturing, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • expanding sales and marketing channels to reach new target customers; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles, strategic sourcing across our major production sites, and optimizing and limiting the growth of our fixed cost base; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement On December 31, 2019, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), which provides for an aggregate credit facility of $450.0 million, comprised of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated our previous senior credit facilities that had a maturity date of May 19, 2021. The new Senior Credit Facilities will mature in December 2024 and include an uncommitted “accordion” feature pursuant to which the commitments thereunder may be increased by an additional $200.0 million in aggregate, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions. Acquisition of ARGES GmbH On July 31, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of €65.5 million ($72.9 million), subject to customary working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of €24.0 million ($26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124,461 Novanta common shares issued at closing (with a fair market value of €9.8 million, or $10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), €7.1 million ($7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and €24.7 million ($27.4 million) deferred cash consideration which is expected to be paid on June 29, 2020. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from August 2019 through December 2026, with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of ARGES will complement and expand our existing portfolio of lasers and laser beam steering solutions capabilities within the Photonics reportable segment. Acquisition of Med X Change, Inc. On June 5, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs in the medical market, 32 for a total purchase price of $21.9 million, net of working capital adjustments. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand and a $21.0 million borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of Med X Change will complement and expand the technology capabilities within our Vision reportable segment to provide our medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions . Acquisition of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. On April 16, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of €14.3 million ($16.2 million), net of working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of €8.5 million ($9.6 million) of cash consideration and €5.8 million ($6.6 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022, with the first payment due in the second quarter of 2020. We expect that the addition of Ingenia will enhance our strategic position in the precision motion control industry by enabling us to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in our Precision Motion reportable segment. 2019 Restructuring During the fourth quarter of 2018, we implemented a restructuring plan intended to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and focus resources on growth initiatives. We incurred costs amounting to $7.5 million related to this restructuring plan in 2019. We anticipate completing the 2019 restructuring program in the first quarter of 2020 and expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $0.1 million to $0.2 million related to the 2019 restructuring program. 33 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for 2019 was $626.1 million, an increase of $11.8 million, or 1.9%, versus 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased demand in the medical market, partially offset by decreased demand in the advanced industrial market related to reductions in industrial manufacturing spending. The effect of our acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 resulted in an increase in revenue of $17.4 million, or 2.8%. In addition, foreign exchange rates adversely impacted our revenue by $9.8 million, or 1.6%, in 2019. Operating income decreased $15.7 million from $71.0 million in 2018 to $55.3 million in 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in research and development and engineering (“R&D”) spending of $4.9 million, an increase in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses of $2.5 million and an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $8.5 million. Basic earnings per common share (“basic EPS”) of $1.16 in 2019 decreased $0.30 from the basic EPS of $1.46 in 2018. Diluted earnings per common share (“diluted EPS”) of $1.15 in 2019 decreased $0.28 from the diluted EPS of $1.43 in 2018. The decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease in operating income and the positive effect of a $1.8 million Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment in 2018 that is not applicable in 2019. Specific components of our operating results for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are further discussed below.

The increase in terms of total dollars was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2018 and 2019. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $15.6 million, or 2.5% of revenue, in 2018, versus $12.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs Restructuring and acquisition related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $16.6 million in 2019, versus $8.0 million in 2018. The increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus 2018 was primarily due to an increase in restructuring charges of $6.6 million as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs and an increase in acquisition related costs of $1.9 million primarily related to an increase in professional services fees, partially offset by a decrease in costs recognized under earn-out agreements. We recorded restructuring and acquisition related costs of $8.0 million in 2018, versus $7.5 million in 2017. The increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs versus 2017 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related charges of $1.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the acquisition of WOM in 2017. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 41,990 $ 59,285 $ 51,660 Vision 21,007 8,991 7,883 Precision Motion 22,339 31,674 27,146 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (30,054 ) (28,937 ) (29,123 ) Total $ 55,282 $ 71,013 $ 57,566 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $42.0 million, or 18.2% of revenue, in 2019, versus $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $11.3 million, an increase in R&D expenses of $2.1 million and restructuring related charges of $5.0 million associated with the 2019 restructuring program, including a $2.2 million impairment of operating lease right-of-use asset. Photonics segment operating income was $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018, versus $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $11.0 million, partially offset by 37 an increase in R&D expenses and SG&A expenses of $3.7 million. Photonics segment operating income was favorably affected by a $2.3 million decrease in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets . Vision Vision segment operating income was $21.0 million, or 7.7% of revenue, in 2019, versus $9.0 million, or 3.9% of revenue, in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $18.0 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses of $1.6 million and SG&A expenses of $2.8 million. Vision segment operating income was negatively affected by a $0.9 million net increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Vision segment operating income was $9.0 million, or 3.9% of revenue, in 2018, versus $7.9 million, or 4.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, partially offset by the inclusion of full-year operating expenses from WOM in 2018. Vision segment operating income was negatively affected by a $1.1 million net increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $22.3 million, or 18.0% of revenue, in 2019, versus $31.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2018. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit of $6.2 million, an increase in R&D expenses of $1.3 million and SG&A expenses of $2.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related earn-out costs of $1.8 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition. Precision Motion segment operating income was $31.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2018, versus $27.1 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $3.5 million and an increase in acquisition earn-out costs of $4.0 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared SG&A functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2019 increased by $1.1 million, or 3.9%, from 2018, primarily due to an increase in restructuring and acquisition related costs of $3.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expenses of $2.6 million primarily related to lower variable compensation expense. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2018 decreased by $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from 2017. Interest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Interest income (expense), net $ (8,493 ) $ (9,814 ) $ (7,165 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net (780 ) 147 (447 ) Other income (expense), net (243 ) (44 ) (229 ) Gain on acquisition of business — — 26,409 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $8.5 million in 2019 versus $9.8 million in 2018. The decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in average debt levels and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.30% and 3.53% during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.1 million and $1.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Net interest expense was $9.8 million in 2018 versus $7.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels as a result of acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 and an increase in the weighted average interest 38 rate on our S enior C redit F acilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.53% and 3.32% during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.8 million net losses in 2019 versus $0.1 million net gains in 2018 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound and Euro, and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.1 million net gains in 2018 versus $0.4 million net losses in 2017 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen, and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal in both 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net other expense was nominal in 2018 versus $0.2 million in 2017. The decrease in net other expense was primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension costs of our frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan covering employees of a divested business. Gain on Acquisition of Business The gain on acquisition of business in 2017 was related to a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million recognized upon gaining control of Laser Quantum in January 2017 as a result of acquiring an additional approximately 35% of its outstanding shares. Income Tax Provision We recorded a tax provision of $5.0 million in 2019, as compared to a tax provision of $10.2 million in 2018. The effective tax rate for 2019 was 10.9% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 16.7% of income before income taxes for 2018. Our effective tax rate for 2019 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, a $2.0 million U.K. patent box deduction, a $1.7 million benefit from share-based compensation, $1.5 million of other tax credits, and $0.8 million of estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income; offset by $0.3 million of non-deductible expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with various acquisitions and $0.2 million of non-deductible acquisition costs. We recorded a tax provision of $10.2 million in 2018, as compared to a tax provision of $13.8 million in 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 16.7% of income before income taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 18.2% of income before income taxes for 2017. Our effective tax rate in 2018 differed from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, including the benefit of the new 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate and $1.6 million of estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income, a $0.9 million benefit from share-based compensation, a $1.9 million U.K. patent box deduction and $1.3 million of other tax credits; offset by $0.8 million of non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 39 Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. There is no assurance that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of December 31, 2019, $57.2 million of our $78.9 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities. Approximately $189.6 million of our outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (defined below) were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. Share Repurchase Plans Our Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at our discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to our employees and directors, the plans do not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2019, we repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million at an average price of $83.71 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. We had $15.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2019. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $50.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. Senior Credit Facilities In December 2019, we entered into the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, consisting of a $100.0 million U.S. dollar equivalent euro-denominated (approximately €90.2 million) 5-year term loan facility and a $350.0 million 5-year revolving credit facility. The Senior Credit Facilities mature in December 2024. The term loan facility requires quarterly scheduled principal repayments of approximately €1.1 million beginning in March 2020 with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity. We may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations at anytime until maturity. As of December 31, 2019, we had a €90.2 million euro-denominated term loan (approximately $101.2 million) and $123.4 million revolver borrowings outstanding under our Senior Credit Facilities. The borrowings outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities bear interest at rates based on (a) the Base Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 0.25% to 1.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio, or (b) the Eurocurrency Rate, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, plus a margin ranging between 1.25% and 2.25% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. In addition, we are obligated to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility, ranging between 0.20% and 0.40% per annum, determined by reference to our consolidated leverage ratio. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that, we believe, are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2019: Requirement Actual December 31, 2019 Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.88 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.35 40 In addition, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents totaled $78.9 million at December 31, 2019, versus $82.0 million at December 31, 2018. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to debt repayments of $50.7 million, current year business acquisitions of $53.1 million, capital expenditures of $10.7 million, and repurchases of common shares of $10.0 million. These cash outflows were offset by cash provided by operating activities of $63.2 million and borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $66.8 million. The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 78,944 $ 82,043 $ 100,057 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 63,248 $ 89,647 $ 63,378 Net cash used in investing activities $ (63,844 ) $ (45,590 ) $ (177,380 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (3,935 ) $ (60,164 ) $ 143,330 Unused borrowing capacity available under revolving credit facility, end of year $ 226,616 $ 189,942 $ 175,547 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $63.2 million in 2019, versus $89.6 million in 2018. Cash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased from 2018 primarily due to increases in net working capital in 2019 which decreased cash provided by operating activities by $27.4 million. Cash provided by operating activities for 2019 was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding which increased from 51 days at December 31, 2018 to 54 days at December 31, 2019 primarily due to poor sales linearity, a decrease in our outstanding payables and accrued expenses, excluding payables and accrued expenses assumed from acquisitions in 2019, and an increase in inventories. Our inventory turnover ratio decreased from 3.4 at December 31, 2018 to 3.1 at December 31, 2019. Cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding and an increase in accrued expenses. The Company’s growth in revenue of $93.0 million and gross profit of $41.0 million increased our outstanding trade receivables and inventories, which negatively impacted our cash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was positively impacted by an increase in our outstanding payables and accrued expenses. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in outstanding trade receivables and an increase in inventories, excluding trade receivables and inventories acquired from acquisitions in 2017, and an increase in income tax payments. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $63.8 million during 2019, primarily driven by the Ingenia and Med X Change acquisitions and the initial cash purchase price for the ARGES acquisition. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $53.1 million cash considerations (net of cash acquired of $4.2 million). We also paid $10.7 million for capital expenditures during 2019. Cash used in investing activities was $45.6 million during 2018, primarily related to $29.6 million in cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to acquisitions in 2018 and $14.7 million for capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $177.4 million during 2017, primarily driven by our acquisitions of WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $185.0 million in cash considerations, which is reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as $168.3 million cash outflows from investing activities (net of cash acquired of $16.7 million and working capital adjustments). We also paid $9.1 million for capital expenditures during 2017. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment as of December 31, 2019. We expect to use approximately $18 million to $21 million in 2020 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. 41 Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $3.9 million during 2019, primarily due to $50.7 million repayment of term loan and revolving credit facility, $6.9 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, and $10.0 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by $66.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund cash considerations paid for the Ingenia, Med X Change and ARGES acquisitions. We also paid $2.7 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into in December 2019. Cash used in financing activities was $60.2 million during 2018, primarily due to $30.8 million of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum, $9.2 million of contractual term loan payments, $65.4 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.6 million of payroll tax payments on share-based compensation awards, and $5.9 million of repurchases of common shares, partially offset by $55.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Zettlex and the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum. Cash provided by financing activities was $143.3 million during 2017, primarily due to $176.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash considerations paid for the WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum acquisitions, partially offset by $7.9 million of contractual term loan payments, $19.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $2.5 million of contingent consideration payments, $2.1 million of payroll withholding tax payments on share-based compensation awards, $0.4 million of repurchases of our common shares and $0.9 million of principal payments under our finance lease obligations. We also paid $0.7 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into in August 2017. In 2020, we are contractually required to pay $5.1 million in repayments under our term loan facility and $1.3 million in principal payments under our finance lease obligations. In addition, we may pay down our term loan and revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities. Pension Plans We maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Our funding policy is to fund the U.K. Plan based on actuarial methods as permitted by the Pensions Regulator in the U.K. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used (such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven assumptions). Each assumption used represents one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known, including actual return on plan assets and pension payments to plan participants. As of December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.5 million. Based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, our annual contributions are expected to be approximately $1.0 million in 2020 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $4.7 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits are further explained in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 42 Contractual Obligations Total 2020 2021 - 2022 2023 - 2024 Thereafter (In thousands) Senior Credit Facilities (1) $ 224,552 $ 5,073 $ 10,142 $ 209,337 $ — Interest on Senior Credit Facilities (2) 25,169 5,293 10,319 9,557 — Finance leases (3) 18,247 1,738 10,185 1,884 4,440 Operating leases (4) 53,416 6,157 11,936 9,182 26,141 Purchase commitments (5) 75,761 74,097 1,640 24 — U.K. pension plan (6) 1,473 985 488 — — Deferred cash considerations (7) 28,873 28,873 — — — Contingent considerations and earn-outs (8) 23,605 3,813 14,318 2,093 3,381 Total contractual obligations $ 451,096 $ 126,029 $ 59,028 $ 232,077 $ 33,962 (1) As of December 31, 2019, a total of $101.2 million term loan and $123.4 million revolving credit facility were outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of approximately €1.1 million ($1.3 million) beginning in March 2020 with the final installment of €68.7 million ($77.1 million) due upon maturity in December 2024. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity in December 2024. (2) For the purpose of this calculation, current interest rates on floating rate obligations (LIBOR plus applicable margin, as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) were used for the remainder contractual life of both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. Current commitment fee rate was used for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2019. (3) Future minimum lease payments under finance leases include the exercise price of an option to purchase a facility for $8.4 million in Germany in 2021. (4) These amounts primarily represent the gross amounts due for leased facilities. The amounts include payments due with respect to both active operating facilities and idle facilities that have been vacated. (5) Purchase commitments represent purchase obligations as of December 31, 2019. (6) Amounts shown represent funding obligations equivalent to $1.0 million per year, increasing 2.9% through 2021, based on annual funding contributions in effect as of December 31, 2019 to achieve fully funded status where the market value of plan assets equals the projected benefit obligations. Future funding requirements will be subject to change as a result of future changes in various actuarial assumptions and actual investment returns on plan assets. (7) These amounts represent the deferred cash considerations for acquisitions in 2018 and 2019 that are expected to be paid in 2020. (8) These amounts represent the estimated contingent consideration and earn-out payments accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 that are expected to be paid between 2020 and 2027. The undiscounted range of the possible contingent consideration and earn-out payments is $3.8 million to $36.7 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2019, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, impairment assessment and valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, valuation of contingent consideration obligations, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. Revenue Recognition. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09” or “Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606 includes the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied. 43 We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers . This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. We occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. We generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for our Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of the costs to service warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent our experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue. We expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. Inventories . Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or trailing historical usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations ratably over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We typically grant two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). For EPS-PSUs, share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the level of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the 44 probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, we recognize the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. The expense related to TSR-PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years , regardless of whether the target relative total stockholder return is achieved . The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement in a large number of simulated scenarios. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model include risk-free interest rate and expected stock price volatility of both the Company’s common shares and the Russell 2000 index. Valuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Key assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and projected cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates, technology obsolescence curves, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines or other indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. We evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit as of the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit’s operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual 45 value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Factors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following: • significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; • changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; • long-term negative industry or economic trends; • technological changes or developments; • changes in competition; • loss of key customers or personnel; • adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; • significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and • the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. The occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified. The most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, using a qualitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 2019, there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Goodwill Intangible Assets, net Property, Plant & Equipment, net Photonics $ 110,952 $ 63,202 $ 31,701 Vision 128,364 81,066 32,033 Precision Motion 35,394 21,907 9,783 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services — — 4,039 Total $ 274,710 $ 166,175 $ 77,556 Accounting for Income Taxes . As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period in which such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made. 46 In conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2019 , we utilized valuation allowance of $ 0.5 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income generated in the current year . The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.9 million, of which $4.8 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, we may need to record up to $0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $168.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $0.2 million. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to product quality, labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statement. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We address market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect our operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposures are the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and with intercompany trading partners that are eliminated in consolidation. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign currency contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge future cash flows or forecasted transactions. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency contracts that hedge these exposures. We had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling $12.4 million and a fair value of less than $0.1 million as of December 31, 2019. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $0.1 million increase in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2019. By contrast, a hypothetical 10% 47 weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $ 0.1 million de crease in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 201 9 . Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. We have $224.6 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2019 would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $2.2 million. 48 Ite m 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOVANTA INC.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Changes in Accounting Principles As discussed in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 50 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Acquisitions of Med X Change, Inc., Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and ARGES GmbH – Valuation of Developed Technologies and Customer Relationships Intangible Assets As described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisitions of Med X Change, Inc., Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and ARGES GmbH in 2019 for purchase prices of $21.9 million, $16.2 million and $72.9 million, respectively. The acquisition of Med X Change, Inc. resulted in $9.9 million of customer relationships intangible assets being recorded, the acquisition of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. resulted in $9.3 million of developed technologies intangible assets being recorded, and the acquisition of ARGES GmbH resulted in $11.8 million of customer relationships intangible assets and $11.4 million of developed technologies intangible assets being recorded. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded by management at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of developed technologies for ARGES GmbH and Med X Change, Inc. were valued using the relief from royalty method. The fair values of developed technologies for Ingenia-CAT, S.L. were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair values of customer relationships were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions by management, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions of Med X Change, Inc., Ingenia-CAT, S.L., and ARGES GmbH is a critical audit matter are (i) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurements of developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimates, (ii) significant audit effort was required in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, such as the revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and discount rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets and controls over the development of the assumptions related to the valuation of these intangible assets, including the revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and discount rates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements, (ii) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets, and (iii) testing management’s assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the developed technologies and customer relationships intangible assets. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, and assessing the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management, including the revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, and discount rates involved considering the past performance of the acquired businesses, as well as economic and industry forecasts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of certain significant assumptions, including the discount rates. The discount rates were evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry factors. Fair Value Measurements of the Contingent Consideration for ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. Acquisitions As described in Notes 4 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had $14.6 million of contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2019 related to the acquisitions of ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. The contingent consideration payments will be payable annually based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026 for ARGES GmbH and from April 2019 through March 2022 for Ingenia-CAT, S.L. As of the acquisition dates, management determined the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities using a Monte Carlo valuation method. The 51 following qualitative information was used by management to determine the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities: historical and projected revenues, revenue volatilities, cost of debt, and the discount rates . The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to valuation of contingent consideration related to the ARGES GmbH and Ingenia-CAT, S.L. acquisitions is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management when determining the estimated fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the Monte Carlo valuation method and assessing the significant assumptions used by management, including the projected revenues, revenue volatilities, and the discount rates, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s fair value measurements of the contingent consideration, including controls over management’s valuation method, significant assumptions and data. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreements, (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value measurements of the contingent consideration, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo valuation method, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the method, and (v) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including the projected revenues, revenue volatilities, and discount rates. Evaluating the assumptions related to projected revenues involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering current and past performance of the acquired businesses, consistency with external market data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s Monte Carlo valuation method and certain significant assumptions, including revenue volatilities and discount rates. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. 52 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., applied on a consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Prior to January 10, 2017, the Company had an approximately 41 % ownership interest in Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”), a privately held company located in the United Kingdom, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized income from its equity method investment amounting to $ 0.1 million, which was included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum. As a result of this transaction, the Company’s ownership in Laser Quantum increased from approximately 41% to approximately 76 %. Since January 10, 2017, Laser Quantum has been consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On September 27, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $ 45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 58 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company determines the allowance based on a variety of factors, including the age of amounts outstanding relative to their contractual due date, specific customer factors, and other known risks and economic trends. Charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as selling, general and administrative expenses and are recorded in the period that the outstanding receivables are determined to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is certain that the receivable will not be recovered. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands): 2019 2018 2017 Balance at beginning of year $ 321 $ 554 $ 565 Provision charged to selling, general and administrative expenses 33 66 283 Allowance resulting from acquisitions 120 — 52 Write-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously reserved ( 179 ) ( 295 ) ( 358 ) Exchange rate changes 2 ( 4 ) 12 Balance at end of year $ 297 $ 321 $ 554 Inventories Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product. The Company records a charge to cost of revenue for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation of its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from 3 to 30 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the lease terms, including any renewal period options that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Certain costs to develop software for internal use are capitalized when the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” are met. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities acquired in a business combination. Allocations of the purchase price are based upon a valuation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure their current fair values exceed their carrying values. The Company’s most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The fair values of intangible assets are based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of the acquired companies and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews the useful life assumptions, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances 59 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 warrant revisions to them. Costs associated with patent and intellectual property applications, renewals or extensions are typically expensed as incurred. The Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is at least one level below the reportable segments. Impairment Charges Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —Goodwill and Other.” The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist. The Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test instead. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of the Company’s reporting units to the estimated fair value of these reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method with a weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the second quarter, and more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company will also reassess the continuing classification of these intangible assets as indefinite-lived when circumstances change such that the useful life may no longer be considered indefinite. The fair values of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using the relief from royalty method, based on forecasted revenues and estimated royalty rates. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The carrying amounts of definite-lived long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value is generally determined by comparison of the asset group’s carrying value to its undiscounted future cash flows. When this test indicates a potential for impairment, a fair value assessment is performed. Once an impairment is determined and measured, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Revenue Recognition See Note 3 for the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Leases The Company leases certain equipment and facilities. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included in operating lease assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are included in current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Finance lease assets are included in property, plant and equipment. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of future lease payments. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Many of the Company’s lease arrangements include both lease (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance or other property management costs). The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components separately. 60 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Most leases held by the Company do not provide an implicit rate. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate for the same jurisdiction and term as the associated lease based on the information available at the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future lease payments. The Company used the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company has a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, the Company applies a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate based on the applicable lease terms and the current economic environment. Research and Development and Engineering Costs Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. These costs are expensed as incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company records the expense associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company also grants two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP earnings per share performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets as well as the level of achievement. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to both the probability and the level of achievement against performance targets. Share-based compensation expense associated with TSR-PSUs is based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model, as of the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and were not material for 2019, 2018 and 2017. Restructuring and Acquisition Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. Accounting for Income Taxes The asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary 61 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the related tax benefits will not be realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and if any existing valuation allowance should be released. The majority of the Company’s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of Canada. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. Consequently, the Company generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that the Company intends to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions that are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses foreign currency contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The time duration of these foreign currency contracts approximates the underlying foreign currency transaction exposures, generally less than three months. These contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The following table provides a brief description of recent Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”): Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, including (i) the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items; (ii) the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment (or vice-versa); and (iii) the exception for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies GAAP for other areas of ASC 740 by clarifying and amending the existing guidance. January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements. 62 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 should be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 on a prospective basis during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 shall be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate under the Tax Reform Act is recognized. January 1, 2019. The Company adopted ASU 2018-02 during the first quarter of 2019. The adoption of ASU 2018-02 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses of financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-13 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 63 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. January 1, 2019. ASU 2016-02 did not have an impact on the Company’s accumulated deficit, consolidated statement of operations, or consolidated statement of cash flows . 3. Revenue In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASU 2014-09 has been applied to those contracts which had not been completed as of January 1, 2018 and all new contracts entered into by the Company subsequent to January 1, 2018. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have an impact on the Company’s Accumulated deficit. The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month , and aggregate to less than 3 % of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the 64 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 estimated warranty cost is recorded in cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the time period between the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good is typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, contract liabilities were $ 3.6 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to $ 4.1 million of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2018, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 19 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 4. Business Combinations 2019 Acquisitions On July 31, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of ARGES GmbH (“ARGES”), a Wackersdorf, Germany-based manufacturer of innovative laser scanning subsystems used in industrial materials processing and medical applications, for a total purchase price of € 65.5 million ($ 72.9 million), subject to customary working capital adjustments. The purchase price consists of € 24.0 million ($ 26.7 million) cash paid at closing, 124,461 Novanta common shares issued at closing (with a fair market value of € 9.8 million, or $ 10.9 million, based on the closing market price of $ 87.58 per share on July 30, 2019), € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration and € 24.7 million ($ 27.4 million) deferred cash consideration which is expected to be paid on June 29, 2020. The initial cash purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from August 2019 through December 2026, with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. The addition of ARGES complements and expands the Company’s existing portfolio of lasers and laser beam steering solutions capabilities within the Photonics reportable segment. On June 5, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Med X Change, Inc. (“Med X Change”), a Bradenton, Florida-based provider of medical grade, high definition and 4K video recording and documentation solutions to OEMs in the medical market. The purchase price of $ 21.9 million, net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and a $ 21.0 million borrowing under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Med X Change complements and broadens the range of technology capabilities within the Company’s Vision reportable segment by providing its medical OEM customers with more integrated operating room solutions. On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding stock of Ingenia-CAT, S.L. (“Ingenia”), a Barcelona, Spain-based provider of high-performance servo drives and control software to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial 65 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 markets , for a total purchase price of € 14.3 million ($ 16.2 million), net of working capital adjustments . The purchase price consists of € 8.5 million ($ 9.6 million) cash consideration and € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) estimated fair value of contingent consideration. The initial cash purchase price was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The contingent consideration will be payable annually based on actual revenue achievement against certain revenue targets from April 2019 through March 2022, with the first payment due in the second quarter of 2020. The undiscounted range of contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. The Ingenia purchase and sale agreement requires € 0.8 million ($ 0.9 million) of the purchase price to be held back by the Company for indemnification of certain representations and warranties claims by the Company until the expiration of the holdback agreement in October 2021 . The addition of Ingenia enhances the Company’s strategic position in precision motion control industry by enabling it to offer a broader range of motion control technologies and integrated solutions. Ingenia is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. The acquisitions of ARGES, Med X Change and Ingenia have been accounted for as business combinations. Purchase price allocation is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition dates. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuation techniques with estimates and assumptions developed by management. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, discount rates and projected future cash flows. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. ARGES The total purchase price for ARGES was allocated as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,159 Accounts receivable 1,430 Inventories 7,129 Property, plant and equipment 14,095 Intangible assets 24,713 Goodwill 43,045 Other assets 2,244 Total assets acquired 95,815 Accounts payable 2,598 Deferred tax liabilities 7,081 Other liabilities 13,207 Total liabilities assumed 22,886 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 72,929 Less: cash acquired 3,159 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 69,770 Less: contingent consideration 7,870 Less: issuance of common shares 10,900 Less: deferred cash consideration 27,442 Initial cash purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 23,558 66 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 The purchase price allocation is preliminary pending final settlement of net working capital adjustment and the deferred purchase price. The fair value of intangible assets for ARGES is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 11,355 15 years Customer relationships 11,800 15 years Trademarks and trade names 1,225 10 years Backlog 333 5 months Total $ 24,713 Customer relationships and backlog for ARGES were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method. Developed technology and trademarks and trade names for ARGES were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 24.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 43.0 million of goodwill. As the ARGES acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) expected future benefits from advancing the Company’s photonic-based product roadmap through the addition of R&D capabilities from ARGES; (ii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (iii) ARGES’s ability to grow the business through new product introductions; and (iv) cost improvements due to the integration of ARGES’s operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ARGES were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 31, 2019. ARGES contributed revenues of $ 4.9 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and purchased intangible assets of $ 2.2 million. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of ARGES, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2018, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2018. 67 NOVANTA INC.

Developed technology for Med X Change and Ingenia were valued using the relief from royalty and multi-period excess earnings methods, respectively. Trademarks and trade names for both Med X Change and Ingenia were valued using the relief-from-royalty method. The Company recorded an aggregate fair value of $ 22.4 million of identifiable intangible assets from the Med X Change and Ingenia acquisitions. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The Company recorded $ 13.4 million of goodwill from these acquisitions. Goodwill amounting to $ 6.2 million from the Med X Change acquisition is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill amounting to $ 7.2 million from the Ingenia acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) the ability of Med X Change and Ingenia to grow the business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) their ability to grow the businesses through new product introductions; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of Med X Change and Ingenia operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. 68 NOVANTA INC.

Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 included amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 1.3 million and compensation expense of $ 4.4 million recognized under earn-out agreements. Zettlex is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. 2017 Acquisitions WOM On July 3, 2017, the Company acquired 100 % of the outstanding shares of W.O.M. World of Medicine GmbH (“WOM”), a Berlin, Germany-based provider of medical insufflators, pumps, and related disposables for OEMs in the minimally invasive surgery market, for a total purchase price of € 118.1 million ($ 134.9 million).

Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows attributable to: (i) WOM’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; and (ii) cost improvements due to expansion in scale. The operating results of WOM were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 3, 2017. WOM contributed revenues of $ 49.4 million and a loss before income taxes of $ 1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Laser Quantum On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum, a Manchester, United Kingdom-based provider of solid state continuous wave lasers, ultrafast lasers, and optical light engines to OEMs in the medical market, for £ 25.5 million ($ 31.1 million) in cash consideration. The purchase price was financed with cash on hand and a $ 30.0 million draw-down on the Company’s revolving credit facility. As a result of this transaction, the Company’s ownership position in Laser Quantum increased from approximately 41 % to approximately 76 %. In connection with the purchase price allocation, upon gaining control over Laser Quantum, the Company recognized a nontaxable gain of $ 26.4 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The gain represented the excess of the fair value of the Company’s previously-held equity interest in Laser Quantum over its carrying value upon gaining control. The fair value of the approximately 41 % equity interest previously held by the Company before the acquisition and the fair value of the approximately 24 % noncontrolling interest held by the remaining shareholders of Laser Quantum after the acquisition were determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow method (an income approach), the guideline public company method (a market approach), and the subject company transaction method (a market approach). The subject company transaction method was based on the purchase price paid by the Company for the acquisition of the additional approximately 35 % of the outstanding shares, while giving consideration to the control and/or minority nature of the subject equity interests. 71 NOVANTA INC.

As the Laser Quantum acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flow potential attributable to: (i) Laser Quantum’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s broader customer base; and (ii) cost improvements due to expansion in scale. The operating results of Laser Quantum were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on January 10, 2017. Laser Quantum contributed revenues of $ 44.7 million and income before income taxes of $ 11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included $ 7.1 million of expenses associated with the amortization of inventory fair value step-up and purchased intangible assets. Laser Quantum is included in the Company’s Photonics reportable segment. As part of the agreement to acquire the additional approximately 35 % of the outstanding shares in January 2017, the Company and the remaining shareholders of Laser Quantum entered into a call and put option agreement for the purchase and sale, in 2020 , of all the remaining Laser Quantum shares held by the remaining shareholders, subject to certain conditions. The purchase 72 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 price for the remaining shares would be based on the proportionate share of the noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum’s cash on hand as of December 31, 2019 and a multiple of Laser Quantum’s EBITDA for the twelve months ending December 31, 2019, as defined in the call and put option agreement. As a result of the put option held by the remaining shareholders, the noncontrolling interest was considered a redeemable equity instrument and was presented as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet. The proportionate share of the net income from Laser Quantum attributable to the noncontrolling interest was reported as a reduction to the consolidated net income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and an increase to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company reported the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the higher of (i) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments or (ii) the estimated redemption value as of the end of each reporting period. The estimated redemption value was determined as of the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the instrument. The resulting adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in shareholders’ equity and did not affect net income attributable to Novanta Inc. However, these adjustments were included in the determination of earnings per common share for the periods in which such adjustments were required (See Note 9). The Company recorded a $ 1.8 million reduction and a $ 20.2 million addition to the noncontrolling interest redemption value for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. On September 27, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24 % of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $ 45.1 million, consisting of $ 30.7 million of cash and 213,219 shares of the Company’s restricted stock. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones included in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture. The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. ThingMagic On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired from Trimble Inc. certain assets and liabilities that constituted the business of ThingMagic, a Woburn, Massachusetts-based provider of ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) radio frequency identification (“RFID”) modules and finished RFID readers to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $ 19.1 million.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 The purchase price allocation resulted in $ 7.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $ 9.9 million of goodwill. As the ThingMagic acquisition was treated as an acquisition of assets for income tax purposes, the goodwill acquired is fully deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) ThingMagic’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) cost synergies in combining the research and development capabilities from ThingMagic with the existing RFID capabilities within Novanta; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ThingMagic operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ThingMagic were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on January 10, 2017. ThingMagic contributed revenues of $ 8.6 million and income before income taxes of $ 0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 included amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of purchased intangible assets of $ 1.5 million. ThingMagic is included in the Company’s Vision reportable segment. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The unaudited pro forma information presented below includes the effects of business combination accounting resulting from the acquisitions of WOM and Laser Quantum, including amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on borrowings in connection with the acquisitions, and elimination of the gain from the Laser Quantum acquisition and income from the Company’s previous equity method investment in Laser Quantum, and the related tax effects, as though the acquisitions had been consummated as of January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2017.

Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 Level 3: Unobservable inputs Current Assets and Liabilities The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Contingent Considerations On July 31, 2019, the Company acquired ARGES. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the ARGES acquisition, the former owner of ARGES is eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from August 2019 through December 2026. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 10.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable annually with the first payment due in the first quarter of 2021. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 7.1 million ($ 7.9 million) was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on revenue performance as of December 31, 2019 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2020 to 2026, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 7.0 million ($ 7.9 million), which is reported as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. 77 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 On April 16, 2019, the Company acquired Ingenia. Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Ingenia acquisition, the former shareholders of Ingenia are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from April 2019 through March 2022. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 8.0 million. If the revenue targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in three annual installments from 2020 to 2022. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration of € 5.8 million ($ 6.6 million) as of the acquisition date was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in restructuring and acquisition related costs until the liability is fully settled. Based on revenue performance as of December 31, 2019 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2020 to 2022, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to € 5.9 million ($ 6.7 million) as of December 31, 2019. On December 14, 2016 , the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by the Company from 2018 to 2021 from products utilizing the acquired technologies. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to € 5.5 million ($ 6.6 million). If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. Based on revenue performance as of December 31, 2019 and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $ 5.8 million as of December 31, 2019. The first payment of $ 2.6 million will be due in the first quarter of 2020. The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 9,262 $ 9,262 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 50 — 50 — $ 9,312 $ 9,262 $ 50 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Contingent considerations - Current $ 3,813 $ — $ — $ 3,813 Foreign currency forward contracts 99 — 99 — Other liabilities: Contingent considerations - Long-term 16,504 — — 16,504 $ 20,416 $ — $ 99 $ 20,317 78 NOVANTA INC.

Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. As of December 31, 2019, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 12.4 million and a net loss of less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $ 31.2 million and a net loss of $ 0.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate net gains of $ 0.8 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, from the settlement of foreign currency forward contracts, which were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 9. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, if any, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Prior to the acquisition of the remaining noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum in September 2018, the Company recognized changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period was also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. However, for both basic and diluted 80 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments were included in the calculation of the numerator for 2018 and 2017 . For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator includes the dilutive effects of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units and certain non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units, determined using the treasury stock method. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period assuming the end of the reporting period is also the end of the performance period. The dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders and non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation after the performance targets have been achieved. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share (in thousands, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2019 (1) 2018 (2) 2017 (3) Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 40,773 $ 51,095 $ 62,307 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest — ( 1,986 ) ( 2,256 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 40,773 49,109 60,051 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment — 1,781 ( 20,244 ) Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 40,773 $ 50,890 $ 39,807 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 35,030 34,913 34,817 Dilutive potential common shares 516 560 463 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,546 35,473 35,280 Antidilutive potential common shares excluded from above 41 4 — Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 1.16 $ 1.46 $ 1.14 Diluted $ 1.15 $ 1.43 $ 1.13 (1) For the year ended December 31, 2019, 46 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest shareholders are considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2019. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2018, 54 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team and 213 shares of restricted stock issued to Laser Quantum former non-controlling interest shareholders were considered contingently issuable shares and were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2018. (3) For the year ended December 31, 2017, 59 non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units granted to certain members of the executive management team were excluded from the calculation of the denominator as the contingent conditions had not been met as of December 31, 2017. 81 NOVANTA INC.

The Company may make additional principal payments at any time, which will reduce the next quarterly installment payment due. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at anytime through December 2024. The Company may be required to prepay outstanding loans under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with the net proceeds of certain asset dispositions and incurrences of certain debt. At the election of the Company, and so long as no default shall have occurred, the Company may reinvest all, or any portion of, the net proceeds from such asset dispositions or incurrences of debt within a year. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $ 226.6 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. Excluding commitment fees, the weighted average interest rate for the Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 2.34 % as of December 31, 2019. The commitment fee rate for the unused commitments under the revolving credit facility was approximately 0.30 % as of December 31, 2019. Guarantees The Senior Credit Facilities is guaranteed by Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Med X Change, Inc., Novanta Medical Technologies Corp., Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited (collectively, “Guarantors”). Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual payment of the principal, interest and fees under the Senior Credit Facilities, when due and payable, whether at maturity, by required prepayment, by acceleration or otherwise. In addition, Guarantors guarantee the due and punctual payment, fees and interest on the overdue principal of the Senior Credit Facilities and the due and punctual performance of all obligations of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees that in the event of any extension, renewal, amendment, refinancing or modification of any of the Senior Credit Facilities, amounts due will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities or any collections from, or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor that makes a payment 84 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 or distribution under a Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor of its pro rata share based on the adjusted net assets of each Guarantor. If at any time any payment of any of the obligations of the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, a Guarantor or otherwise, the Guarantees will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not been made. Each Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee and its obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) the Guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; or (ii) payment in full of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facilities and all other obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Guarantors could be required to make under the Guarantee is the principal amount of the Senior Credit Facilities plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, as of December 31, 2019, the Guarantors were not expected to be required to perform under the Guarantee. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Deferred Financing Costs In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company capitalized an additional $ 3.0 million of deferred financing costs. The Company allocated these costs between the term loan and the revolving credit facility based on the maximum borrowing capacity and amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. Previously unamortized deferred financing costs will continue to be amortized. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs was $ 1.1 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 0.8 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value of Debt As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 12. Leases Most leases held by the Company expire between 2020 and 2034 . In the U.K., where longer lease terms are more common, the Company has a land lease that extends through 2078 . Certain leases include terms such as an option to purchase the property, one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years , and options to terminate the leases within one year . The exercise of lease renewal or termination option is at the Company’s sole discretion; therefore, the majority of renewals to extend the lease terms are not included in the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities as they are not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company regularly evaluates the renewal options and includes the renewal periods in the lease term when they are reasonably certain of being exercised. The depreciable life of right-of-use assets and leasehold improvements is limited to the expected lease terms. 85 NOVANTA INC.

Common Shares and Share-Based Compensation Capital Shares The authorized capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of common shares without nominal or par value. Holders of common shares are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common shares are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by the Board of Directors, and to share ratably in the Company’s assets legally available for distribution to shareholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common shares have no redemption or conversion rights. 87 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Common S hare Repurchase s The Company’s Board of Directors may approve share repurchase plans from time to time. Under these repurchase plans, shares may be repurchased at the Company’s discretion based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s common shares, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated share purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common shares to be repurchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. While the share repurchase plans are generally intended to offset dilution from equity awards granted to the Company’s employees and directors, the plans do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common shares. No time limit is typically set for the completion of the share repurchase plans, and the plans may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund share repurchases through cash on hand and cash generated from operations. In October 2013, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2013 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 10.0 million worth of common shares. During 2018, the Company repurchased 89 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $ 5.9 million at an average price of $ 65.43 per share. During 2017, the Company repurchased 14 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $ 0.4 million at an average price of $ 26.41 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 385 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 25.97 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had completed the 2013 Repurchase Plan. In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of $ 25.0 million worth of common shares. Share repurchases have been made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During 2019, the Company repurchased 119 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $ 10.0 million at an average price of $ 83.71 per share under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. The Company had $ 15.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2019. In February 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2020 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $ 50.0 million worth of common shares. The Company expects that share repurchases will be made under the 2020 Repurchase Plan after the 2018 Repurchase Plan is completed. 2010 Incentive Award Plan In November 2010, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan under which the Company may grant share-based compensation awards to employees, consultants and directors. In May 2014, the Company’s shareholders approved the amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan and, in July 2016, the Company approved a further amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the “Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan”). The maximum number of shares which can be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan is 4,398,613 , subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and stock payments (collectively referred to as “Awards”). The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for specific limits on the number of shares with respect to Awards that may be granted to any person during any calendar year and the amount of cash that can be paid with respect to Awards to any one person during any calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan will expire and no further Awards may be granted after April 9, 2024 . As of December 31, 2019, there were 840,889 shares available for future awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. Shares subject to Awards that have expired, forfeited or settled in cash, or repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the awardee may be added back to the number of shares available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan and may be granted as new Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares will not be added back to the number of shares available for grant: (a) shares that are used to pay the exercise price for an option, (b) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to any Award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to the extent they exceed the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the tax liability based on minimum withholding rates, (c) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, (d) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and (e) shares purchased on the open market with the 88 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares issued to satisfy Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan may be previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares repurchased on the open market. Share-Based Compensation Expense The table below summarizes share-based compensation expense recorded in operating income (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Selling, general and administrative $ 8,361 $ 6,997 $ 5,065 Research and development and engineering 497 438 221 Cost of revenue 482 211 207 Restructuring and acquisition related costs — 68 — Total share-based compensation expense $ 9,340 $ 7,714 $ 5,493 The expense recorded during each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included $ 0.9 million, $ 0.5 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, related to restricted stock units and deferred stock units granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s outstanding equity awards for which compensation expense will be recognized in the future consisted of time-based restricted stock units and performance stock units granted under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Company expects to record an aggregate share-based compensation expense of $ 15.5 million, net of estimated forfeitures, over a weighted average period of 1.12 years subsequent to December 31, 2019, for all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2019. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued to employees with vesting periods ranging from three years to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. There were 187 thousand and 179 thousand DSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, which were included in the calculation of weighted average basic shares outstanding for the respective periods. The table below summarizes activities during 2019 relating to restricted and deferred stock units issued and outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Restricted and Deferred Stock Units (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2018 529 $ 26.98 Granted 139 $ 77.37 Vested ( 172 ) $ 27.98 Forfeited ( 43 ) $ 49.20 Unvested at December 31, 2019 453 $ 39.74 1.38 years $ 40,057 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2019 431 $ 38.35 1.38 years $ 38,079 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 88.44 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2019 due to the fact that the restricted stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. The total fair value of restricted stock units and deferred stock units that vested in 2019, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the day of vesting, was $ 13.4 million. 89 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Performance Stock Units The Company typically grants two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of a three-year performance period. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over the three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200 % of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. The table below summarizes activities during 2019 relating to performance-based stock awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan: Performance Stock Units (1) (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (2) (in thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2018 137 $ 37.28 Granted 47 $ 92.14 Performance adjustment ( 3 ) 29 $ 14.13 Vested ( 58 ) $ 14.13 Forfeited ( 3 ) $ 79.26 Unvested at December 31, 2019 152 $ 57.95 0.92 years $ 13,477 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2019 269 $ 43.50 0.92 years $ 23,769 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target, except for the number of shares vested, which reflects the number of shares earned and expected to be issued. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned was approximately 305 thousand. (2) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $ 88.44 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2019 due to the fact that the performance stock units carry a $ 0 purchase price. (3) The amount shown represents performance adjustments for performance-based awards granted on March 30, 2016. These units vested at 200 % during 2019 based on the achievement of cumulative Non-GAAP EPS during the performance period of fiscal years 2016 through 2018. 90 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 The total fair value of PSUs that vested in 2019, based on the market price of the underlying shares on the date of vesting, was $ 5.0 million . The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2019 Grant-date stock price $ 77.23 Expected volatility 32.54 % Risk-free interest rate 2.46 % Expected annual dividend yield — Weighted average fair value $ 108.58 Stock Options On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 193 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vested ratably on the anniversary date of the grant date over a three-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of these stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options included the expected option term, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected term of the options, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company recognized the compensation expense of stock options on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. No stock options were granted during 2019. The following table shows stock options that were outstanding, exercisable and expected to vest as of December 31, 2019 and the related weighted average exercise price, weighted average remaining contractual term and aggregate intrinsic value: Number of Shares (In thousands) Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Stock options outstanding 73 $ 14.13 6.25 $ 5,407 Stock options exercisable 73 $ 14.13 6.25 $ 5,407 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the closing market price of $ 88.44 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2019 and the exercise price of the stock options. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised in 2019, based on the difference between the market price on the date of exercise and the date of grant, was $ 2.4 million. The total amount of cash received from the exercise of these stock options was $ 0.4 million. The Company did no t record any income tax deductions from the stock options exercised in 2019 as these were non-qualified stock options. 14. Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution employee retirement savings plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. The Company matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis of percentages specified in each plan. The Company’s matching contributions to the plans were $ 4.4 million, $ 3.9 million and $ 3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Defined Benefit Plan The Company maintains a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003. Benefits under the U.K. 91 NOVANTA INC.

The Company continues to fund the plan in accordance with the pension regulations in the U.K . The net periodic pension cost is included in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and consisted of the following components (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Components of the net periodic pension cost: Interest cost $ 971 $ 939 $ 991 Expected return on plan assets ( 1,671 ) ( 1,717 ) ( 1,665 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 957 826 1,045 Amortization of prior service cost 29 — — Net periodic pension cost $ 286 $ 48 $ 371 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Weighted-average discount rate 2.7 % 2.4 % 2.6 % Weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.1 % 4.8 % 5.2 % The actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Weighted-average discount rate 1.9 % 2.7 % Rate of inflation 2.5 % 2.8 % 92 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 The discount rates used are derived from (AA) corporate bonds that have maturities approximating the terms of the pension obligations under the U.K. Plan . In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the historical performance of the major asset classes held by the U.K. Plan and current forecasts of future rates of return for these asset classes. The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.K. Plan (in thousands): December 31, 2019 2018 Change in benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 36,882 $ 40,329 Interest cost 971 939 Actuarial (gains) losses 3,005 ( 1,718 ) Benefits paid ( 1,696 ) ( 1,301 ) Prior service cost (1) — 754 Foreign currency exchange rate changes 1,294 ( 2,121 ) Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 40,456 $ 36,882 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 40,456 $ 36,882 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 33,124 $ 36,476 Actual return on plan assets 5,410 ( 1,083 ) Employer contributions 894 941 Benefits paid ( 1,696 ) ( 1,301 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes 1,251 ( 1,909 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 38,983 $ 33,124 Funded status at end of year $ ( 1,473 ) $ ( 3,758 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost: Net actuarial losses at beginning of year $ ( 11,120 ) $ ( 10,493 ) Net actuarial gains (losses) during the year 734 ( 1,083 ) Prior service cost arising during the year (1) — ( 754 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income before income taxes 986 826 Foreign currency exchange rate changes ( 306 ) 384 Net actuarial losses $ ( 9,706 ) $ ( 11,120 ) Amounts expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year consists of: Net actuarial losses $ 706 $ 959 Prior service cost 30 29 (1) On October 26, 2018, the High Court of Justice in the U.K. ruled that the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (“GMPs”) provided by pension schemes need to equalize lifetime GMP benefits between genders. In order to meet the requirements set out by the High Court, the Company recorded an estimate of $ 0.8 million additional benefit obligations based on the existing plan participants, the date the U.K. Plan was allowed to stop accruing additional benefits, the pension plan rules and the approach taken to equalize the benefits. The additional benefit obligations will be amortized and recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants. 93 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 The funded status of the U.K. Plan is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The following table reflects the total expected benefit payments to plan participants and have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Amount 2020 $ 1,104 2021 1,181 2022 1,038 2023 1,137 2024 1,502 2025-2026 8,612 Total $ 14,574 In the U.K., funding valuations are conducted every three years in order to determine the future level of contributions. Based on the results of the most recent valuation, the Company’s annual contributions will be approximately $ 1.0 million in 2020 and will increase by 2.9 % per year thereafter. Fair Value of Plan Assets The trustees of the U.K. Plan have the fiduciary responsibilities to manage the plan assets in consultation with the Company. The overall objective is to invest plan assets in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve balanced growth through a combination of investments in equities for long-term growth and investments in debt instruments that match a portion of the expected future benefit payments and to maintain adequate liquidity to make pension payments to pensioners.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 In determining its income tax provisions, the Company calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate jurisdiction. The Company then considered a number of factors, including positive and negative evidence related to the realization of its deferred tax assets, to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to its deferred tax assets. In 2019, the Company utilized valuation allowance of $ 0.5 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income generated in the current year. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $ 0.4 million valuation allowance associated with an increase in deferred tax assets in Canada. In 2018, the Company utilized valuation allowance of $ 0.3 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions due to taxable income generated during the year. Valuation allowance continues to be provided on the remaining balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.8 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $ 0.3 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037 ; and $ 3.5 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.2 million and $ 0.5 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $ 3.7 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $ 0.7 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037 ; and $ 3.0 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033 . In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $ 5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $ 5.2 million and $ 0.5 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 2.8 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $ 0.9 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $ 0.8 million will expire through 2034 and $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $ 1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 1.2 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $ 2.8 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $ 0.9 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $ 0.8 million will expire through 2033 and $ 0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $ 1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $ 1.2 million expires through 2022 and $ 0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $ 168.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The estimated unrecognized income tax and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $ 0.2 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 4.9 million, of which $ 4.8 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $ 0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all significant income tax uncertainties. 97 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 4.7 million, of which $ 3.6 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. The reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2016 $ 4,962 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 991 Additions for tax positions of prior years 496 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 28 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 1,577 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 755 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 4,089 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 394 Additions for tax positions of prior years 655 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 69 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 239 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 105 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 4,725 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 727 Additions for tax positions of prior years 5 Reductions to tax positions of prior years ( 31 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations ( 497 ) Settlements with tax authorities — Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 4,929 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax provision. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had approximately $ 0.5 million and $ 0.5 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized less than $ 0.1 million of expense for an increase in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company files income tax returns in Canada, the U.S., and various foreign jurisdictions. Generally, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. or foreign income tax examinations, including transfer pricing tax audits, by tax authorities for the years before 2010. The Company’s income tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the following countries for the following periods under the appropriate statute of limitations: United States 2016 - Present Canada 2016 - Present United Kingdom 2018 - Present Germany 2015 - Present The Netherlands 2013 - Present China 2010 - Present Japan 2014 - Present 98 NOVANTA INC.

Commitments and Contingencies Purchase Commitments As of December 31, 2019, the Company had purchase commitments primarily for inventory purchases of $ 75.8 million. These purchase commitments are expected to be incurred as follows: $ 74.2 million in 2020, $ 0.8 million in 2021 and $ 0.8 million in 2022. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties The Company maintains financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. From time to time, certain of these instruments may subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk whereby one institution may hold a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents, or one customer may represent a large portion of the accounts receivable balances. There was no significant concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s position in trade accounts receivable as no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is generally minimized because of the diversification of the Company’s operations, as well as its large customer base and its geographic dispersion. 101 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 Certain of the components and materials included in the Company’s products are currently obtained from single source suppliers. There can be no assurance that a disruption of the supply of such components and materials would not create substantial manufacturing delays and additional cost to the Company. The Company’s operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, rapidly changing technologies, and international operations. 18. Related Party Transactions As of March 29, 2019, certain members of the Company’s board of directors served on the board of directors or as advisors of companies that are customers of the Company. All contracts with related parties were executed at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business. As of the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, these customers were no longer considered to be related parties. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $ 11.6 million and $ 40.0 million in the three months ended March 29, 2019 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively. There was $ 0.6 million in accounts receivable due from these customers as of December 31, 2018. There were no material transactions with related parties in 2017. 19. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.

Controls and Procedures The required certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are included in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting and changes in internal control over financial reporting referred to in those certifications. Those certifications should be read in conjunction with this Item 9A for a more complete understanding of the matters covered by the certifications. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures as of December 31, 2019 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making their assessment, our management utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework , issued by COSO in 2013, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2018, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 6 Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2018, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. Working Capital Requirements There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital . Customers We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Customers of our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include a large number of OEM customers who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. We also sell directly to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on a number of factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain of our products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. Seasonality While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines, particularly our visualization solutions, imaging informatics, and thermal chart recorder products, are impacted in the first and fourth quarters by seasonality due to hospital budgeting cycles. Backlog As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated backlog was approximately $234.4 million and $187.1 million, respectively. The majority of orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve-month period. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. Manufacturing Manufacturing functions are performed internally when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process or for cost related reasons while some of the less critical portions are outsourced to third parties. To the extent it makes financial sense, we will consider outsourcing additional portions of the production process. Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse and Rochester, New York; San Jose, California; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Loomis, California; Poole and Cambridge, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Many of our products are manufactured under ISO 9001 certification, while the majority of our products manufactured for the medical market are manufactured under ISO 13485 certification. Our medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are also manufactured under ISO 14001 certification. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders and imaging informatics 7 products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) , which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In addition, certain visualization solutions, thermal printers, imaging informatics and medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessori es products are manufactured under section 510(k) of the FDA. Marketing, Sales and Distribution We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. Sales outside of the United States are largely based on a direct sales force, but occasionally are sold through distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain several service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Competition The markets in which we compete are dynamic and highly competitive. Due to the wide range of our products, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and the prices at which these products are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments. Competitive factors in our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include product performance, price, quality and reliability, features, compatibility of products with existing systems, technical support, product breadth, market presence, on-time delivery and our overall reputation. We believe that our products offer a number of competitive advantages. However, some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources. Raw Materials, Components and Supplies Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Patents and Intellectual Property We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold a number of registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole. We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 8 Human Resources As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we employed 2,133 and 2,034 employees, respectively. We also utilize temporary and contract personnel that are not included in these headcount numbers. Government Regulation Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. Such rules are subject to changes by the governing agencies and we monitor those changes closely. We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)). Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment. Medical Device Regulation Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and local authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products. FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements. 9 510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. Post-market Regulation After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: • establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; • QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; • labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; • FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information; • clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices; • medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; • correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; • complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); • the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and • post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device. We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the 10 facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testi ng, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaint s file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturin g operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasin g severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the marke t or voluntary or mandatory device recalls. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: • warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; • recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; • operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; • refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; • withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; • refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or • criminal prosecution. Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. These laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the federal government information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. For further information regarding other healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products.” Other Information We maintain a website with the address https://www.novanta.com.

Risk Factors The following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and could cause the market value of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. These risk factors may not include all of the important factors that could affect our business or that could cause our future financial results to differ materially from historical or expected results or cause the market price of our common shares to fluctuate or decline. Risks Relating to our Business Our results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers’ businesses and levels of business activities. A large portion of our product sales are dependent on our customers’ need for increased capacity, productivity and cost saving initiatives, improved product quality and performance, and new investments. Weaknesses in our end markets could negatively impact our revenue and gross margin and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A severe and/or prolonged overall economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could lead to weaknesses in our end markets and adversely affect our customers’ financial condition and the timing or levels of business activity of our customers and the industries we serve. In particular, diminished growth expectations in China, economic and political uncertainty in Europe as Britain negotiates withdrawal from the European Union, as well as political and economic uncertainty in the U.S. could adversely impact our customers’ financial condition and ability to maintain product order levels in the future. This may reduce the demand for our products or depress pricing for our products and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand for products or services for which we do not have competitive advantages. This could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changes in economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our business could be negatively affected. Our business depends significantly upon our customers’ capital expenditures, which are subject to cyclical market fluctuations. Certain sub-segments of the advanced industrial market that we serve, including the microelectronics and industrial capital equipment markets, are cyclical and have historically experienced periods of oversupply, resulting in downturns in demand for capital equipment in which many of our products are used. The timing, length and severity of these downturns and their impact on our business are difficult to predict. Further, our order levels or results of operations for a given period may not be indicative of order levels or results of operations for subsequent periods. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon industries that are subject to market cycles which, in turn, could adversely affect the market demand for our products. We experienced significant cyclical end market fluctuations in the past. We cannot predict when slowdowns will recur or that the impact of such slowdowns will be more or less significant compared to historical fluctuations. Our business success depends upon our ability to respond to fluctuations in product demand, but doing so may require us to incur costs despite limited visibility toward future business declines. During a period of increasing demand and rapid growth, we must be able to increase manufacturing capacity quickly. Our inability to quickly increase production in response to a surge in demand could prompt customers to look for alternative sources of supply or leave our customers without a supply, both of which events could harm our reputation and make it difficult for us to retain our existing customers or to obtain new customers and have a material adverse effect on our business. In periods of weak demand, we may be required to reduce costs while maintaining the ability to motivate and retain key employees at the same time. Additionally, to remain competitive, we must continually invest in research and development, which may inhibit our ability to reduce costs in a down cycle. Long product lead-times create a risk that we may purchase or manufacture inventories of products that we are unable to sell. The success of our business depends on our ability to continuously innovate and to manage transitions to new product innovations. Technology requirements in our markets are constantly changing. We must continually introduce new products that meet evolving customer needs. Our ability to grow depends on the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new or enhanced products that address our customers’ requirements. Developing new technology is a complex and uncertain process requiring us to accurately anticipate technological and market trends and meet those trends with the right products. Additionally, this requires that we manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns, avoid excess inventory and ensure 12 adequate supplies of new products. Failure to develop new products, failed market acceptance of new products or problems associated with new product transitions could harm our business. We cannot predict how the market will react to new products introduced by us or to enhancements made to our existing products. If any of our new or enhanced products contain defects or perceived defects or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems or perceived problems, or if our competitors release similar products or enhancements at the same time that are more widely accepted by our customers, our revenue and results of operations for one or more reporting periods could be adversely affected. If we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets. Our research and development efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of products within the time frame that our customers demand. Our competitors may introduce new or improved products, processes or technologies that make our current or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. We may encounter delays or problems in connection with our research and development efforts. Product development delays may result from numerous factors, including: • changing product specifications and customer requirements; • inability to manufacture new products cost effectively; • difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; • changing market or competitive product requirements; and • unanticipated engineering complexities. New products often take longer to develop, may have fewer features than originally considered desirable, and have higher costs than initially estimated. There may be difficulty in sourcing components for new products and delays in starting volume production. New products may also not be commercially successful. Any of these adverse developments could lead to loss of market share and inability to achieve our anticipated revenue growth targets. Customer order timing and other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Changes in customer order timing and the existence of certain other factors beyond our control may cause our operating results to fluctuate from period to period. Such factors include: • fluctuations in our customers’ businesses; • timing and recognition of revenues from customer orders; • timing and market acceptance of new products or enhancements introduced by us or our competitors; • availability of parts from our suppliers and the manufacturing capacity of our subcontractors; • decisions by customers to reduce their purchases of our products; • changes in the prices of our products or of our competitors’ products; and • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may receive several large orders in one quarter from a customer and then receive no orders from that customer in the next quarter. As a result, the timing of revenue recognition from customer orders can cause significant fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter. In addition, our sales are reactive to changes in our customers’ businesses. For instance, a customer that placed a large order in one period could subsequently experience a downturn in business and, as a result, could cancel an order or reduce the amount of products it purchases from us in future periods. A delay in a shipment near the end of a reporting period due to rescheduling or cancellation by customers or unexpected production delays experienced by us may cause revenue in the period to decline significantly and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results for that period. In addition, we or our competitors may raise or lower prices of products in response to market demands or competitive pressures. If we lower the prices of our products, or if our competitors lower the prices of their products such that demand for our products weakens, our revenue for one or more quarters may decline and our operating results would be adversely affected. 13 As a result of these factors, our results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future per iods. If we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected. We rely on information technology systems throughout the Company to manage orders, process shipments to customers, manage inventory levels and maintain financial, customer and employee information. Certain events could result in the disruption of our systems, including power outages, computer attacks by hackers, viruses, catastrophes, hardware and software failures and other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a significant period of disruption in information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of revenue and customers as well as significant response and mitigation costs, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial or reputational damage to us, as well as litigation, regulatory enforcement action, or other liability risks that could lead to substantial damages, fines, penalties and legal costs. We also expend substantial amounts to protect our information technology systems, and if we were to experience a significant breach in security of our information technology systems, we may need to materially increase such expenditures, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, our insurance to cover costs in the event of a breach may be insufficient to cover such costs. Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws, regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business and financial results. Legislation in various countries around the world with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection is rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment. We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world, some of which place restrictions on our ability to process personal data across our business. In particular, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, has caused more stringent data protection requirements in the European Union. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and implement policies as part of its mandated privacy governance framework. It also requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects how their personal information is to be used;, imposes limitations on retention of personal data; introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements; and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those E.U. jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to the GDPR. Certain breaches of the GDPR requirements could result in substantial fines, which can be up to four percent of worldwide revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease/change our use of data, enforcement notices, as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our GDPR compliance efforts and our data privacy compliance efforts in general. These compliance efforts may be time-intensive and costly. Despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm if we fail to protect the privacy of third party data or comply with the GDPR or other applicable regimes. As we transact a portion of our sales, and maintain significant cash balances, in foreign currencies, changes in interest rates, credit ratings or foreign currency rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A portion of our revenue is derived from our European and Asian operations and includes transactions in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen, while our products are mainly manufactured in the U. S., U.K., Germany and China. In the event of a decline in the value of the Euro, British Pounds or Japanese Yen, we would typically experience a decline in our revenues and profit margins. If we increase the selling prices on our products sold in Europe and Asia in order to maintain profit margins and recover costs, we may lose customer sales to lower cost competitors. Additionally, balances maintained in foreign currencies create additional financial exposure to changing foreign currency rates. If foreign currency rates were to change significantly, we could incur material losses. While we use foreign currency contracts and other risk management techniques to hedge our foreign currency exposure, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant foreign currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks. 14 Our reliance on international operations in foreign countries subjects us to risks not typically faced by companies operating exclusively in the U.S . During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 61% of our revenues were derived from operations and customers outside of the U.S. The scope of our international operations subjects us to risks that could materially impact our results of operations, including: • foreign exchange rate fluctuations; • increases in shipping costs; • longer customer payment cycles; • greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable; • use of incompatible systems and equipment; • problems with staffing and managing foreign operations in diverse cultures; • trade tariffs; • trade barriers and export/import controls; • transportation delays and interruptions; • increased vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, intellectual property rights; • government currency control and restrictions, delays, penalties or required withholdings on repatriation of earnings; • compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including those that potentially conflict with other jurisdictions; • the impact of recessionary foreign economies; and • natural disasters and acts of terrorism. We also are subject to risks that our operations outside the U.S. could be conducted by our employees, contractors, service providers, representatives or agents in ways that violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-bribery laws. Any such violations could have a negative impact on our business and could result in government investigations and/or injunctive, monetary or other penalties. Moreover, our anti-bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third-party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services. Such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct, which may increase the risk of violations of anti-bribery laws. Increased outsourcing of components manufacturing to manufacturers outside the U.S. leads to additional risks that could negatively impact our business. We are increasingly outsourcing the manufacture of subassemblies to suppliers based in China and elsewhere overseas in order to reduce our manufacturing cost. However, economic, political or trade problems with foreign countries could substantially impact our ability to obtain critical parts needed in the timely manufacture of our products, or could substantially increase the costs of these parts. Additionally, this practice increases our vulnerability to the theft of, and reduced protection for, our intellectual property. Increases in tariffs, trade restrictions or taxes on our products could have an adverse impact on our operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 61% of our revenues were derived from operations and customers outside of the U.S. We also manufacture certain of our products and purchase a portion of our raw materials and components from suppliers in China and other foreign countries. The commerce we conduct in the international marketplace makes us subject to tariffs, trade restrictions and other taxes when the raw materials or components we purchase, and the products we ship, cross international borders. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as those between the U.S. and Canada, Mexico and other countries have been escalating in recent months. Most notably, three rounds of U.S. tariffs were placed on Chinese goods being exported to the U.S., with such tariffs taking effect in July, August and September 2018. Each of these U.S. tariff impositions against Chinese exports were followed by a round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports to China. Certain of the raw materials and components we purchase from China are subject to these tariffs, which has increased our manufacturing costs and could make our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose inputs are not subject to these tariffs. Certain of our finished products manufactured in the U.S. have been subject to the retaliatory tariffs in China, which has increased our cost and made our products less competitive than those of our competitors whose products are not subject to such retaliatory tariffs. In addition, the U.S. administration has threatened to impose tariffs on all products imported from China, which would impact all of our products and supplies imported from China to the U.S.; and the Chinese government has threatened to levy additional retaliatory tariffs on U.S. manufactured goods. If these were to occur, we 15 may not be able to mitigate the impacts of these tariffs, and our b usiness, results of operations and financial position would be materially adversely affected. Products we sell into certain foreign markets could also become subject to similar retaliatory tariffs, making the products we sell uncompetitive to similar produ cts not subjected to such import tariffs. Further changes in U.S. trade policies, tariffs, taxes, export restrictions or other trade barriers, or restrictions on raw materials or components may limit our ability to produce products, increase our manufactur ing costs, decrease our profit margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase raw materials or components, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and finan cial conditions. Our global operations are subject to extensive and complex import and export rules that vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to comply with these rules could result in substantial penalties. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import and export related laws and regulations, including U.S. export control and customs regulations and customs regulations of other countries. These regulations are complex and vary among the legal jurisdictions in which we operate. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with such regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S. Any of these penalties could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the U.K. is likely to implement new import and export rules as part of the process of exiting the European Union. There will likely be new costs of compliance associated with such rules, as well as the additional risk of penalties for failure to comply. The U.K.’s plan for withdrawal from the European Union and the actions of the current U.S. government may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business, which could reduce the price of our common shares. We are a multinational company with worldwide operations, including business operations and investments in the U. K., Germany and China. In March 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May of the U.K. formally began the process of withdrawing the U. K. from the European Union, following the June 2016 referendum in which a majority of voters in the U. K. supported such withdrawal. The terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least until March 2019. The announcement has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U. K. and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other European Union member states to consider withdrawal. If the U. K. and the European Union are unable to negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free access between the U. K. and other European Union member states or among the European economic area overall could be diminished or eliminated. These developments in turn may inhibit our sales of products, mobility of our personnel, and our access to capital. The policies of the current U.S. government regarding U.S. trade, tax and health care policies, among other things, have led to substantial uncertainty in global financial markets. The current U.S. government has withdrawn the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, has re-negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and has made various comments suggesting the possible re-negotiation of, or withdrawal from, other trade agreements, has imposed significant tariffs on imports from China and other countries, and has suggested the potential imposition of other significant new import barriers. The current U.S. government has also enacted comprehensive tax law reform, and attempted to repeal the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), and may continue to seek repeal of the PPACA. These developments and the lack of clarity regarding future U.S. tax, trade and health care policies have created significant uncertainty that could have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any major changes in these policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our common shares. Because of the global nature of our business, and our strategy to increase our sales to the medical market, our business may be particularly impacted by any major changes in U.S. trade, tax and health care policies. Others may violate our intellectual property rights and cause us to incur significant costs to protect our rights. Our future success depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation. We do not have personnel dedicated to the oversight, organization and management of our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or disclosure. It is possible that, despite our efforts, other parties may use, obtain or try to copy our technology and products. There can be no assurance that other companies are not investigating or developing other technologies similar to ours, that any patents will be issued from any application filed by us, or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficient to deter or prohibit others from marketing similar products. In addition, our patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in a legal or administrative proceeding. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights is difficult and time consuming and may involve initiating claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights, which could be costly and divert management resources. 16 Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights against infringement may not be effective in some foreign countries where we operat e or sell our products. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property in these countries, we may lose significant business to our competitors. Our operating results would suffer if we are unable to successfully defend against infringement claims by third parties. We have received in the past, and could receive in the future, notices from third parties alleging that our products infringe patent or other proprietary rights. These allegations could result in significant costs and diversion of the attention of management. Adverse consequences may also apply if we fail to avoid or successfully defend litigation for infringement or misappropriation of proprietary rights of third parties. If a successful claim were brought against us and we were found to have infringed a third-party’s intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay substantial amounts for damages or be enjoined from using the technology deemed to be infringing, or from using, making or selling products deemed to be infringing, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. If we have supplied infringing products to third parties, we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages that they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses that they may sustain as a result of the infringement. We operate in highly competitive industries and, if we lose competitive advantages, our business would suffer adverse consequences. Some of our competition comes from established competitors that have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and introduce new products. It is possible that we may not successfully differentiate our current and proposed products from the products of our competitors, or that the marketplace will not consider our products to be superior to competing products. To remain competitive, we will be required to invest heavily in research and development, marketing and customer service and support. However, we may not be able to make the necessary technological advances to maintain our competitive position and our products may not receive market acceptance. These factors would cause us not to be able to compete successfully in the future. Increased competition may also result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our new product development programs. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to successfully integrate future acquisitions or to grow the acquired businesses. As part of our business strategy, we expect to broaden our product and service offerings by acquiring businesses, technologies, assets and product lines that, we believe, complement or expand our existing businesses. In recent years, we have made a number of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of W.O.M. World of Medicine GmbH, Laser Quantum Limited and Zettlex Limited, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. We may fail to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates or integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or personnel into our businesses and, as a result, may fail to realize the synergies, cost savings and other benefits expected from the acquisitions. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, and our results of operations could be adversely affected. As a result of the number of recent and expected future acquisitions in a relatively short amount of time, these risks may be heightened due to limited resources available to integrate these new businesses. Our acquisition activities may divert management’s attention from our regular operations. Managing a larger and more geographically dispersed operation and product portfolio could also pose challenges for our management team. Further, our ability to maintain and increase profitability of an acquired business will depend on our ability to manage and control operating expenses and to generate and sustain increased levels of revenue. Our expectations to achieve more consistent and predictable levels of revenue and to increase profitability as a result of any acquisition may not be realized. Such revenues and profitability may even decline as we integrate operations into our businesses. If revenues of acquired businesses decline or grow more slowly than we anticipate, or if their operating expenses are higher than we expect, we may not be able to sustain or increase their profitability, in which case our financial condition will suffer and our stock price could decline. In addition, through our acquisitions, we may assume liabilities, losses or costs for which we are not indemnified or insured or for which our indemnity or insurance is inadequate. Any such liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. If we do not attract and retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited. Our success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of our executive officers, key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. 17 Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transit ion key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. These actions may not improve our financial position, and may ultimately prove detrimental to our operations and sales. We have undertaken restructuring and realignment activities in the past, and we will continue to assess our operating structure in the future. Our ability to reduce operating expenses is dependent upon the nature of the actions we take to reduce expenses and our subsequent ability to implement those actions and realize expected cost savings. We may need to take additional restructuring actions, such as eliminating or consolidating certain of our facilities or operations, reducing our headcount, or eliminating certain positions for a variety of reasons, including deterioration in global economic conditions or significant declines in demand for our products. Failure to successfully implement such restructuring activities could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could increase the cost of production versus our projections, both of which could adversely impact our operating results. Further, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with our restructuring activities, including severance costs and the loss of trained employees with knowledge of our business and operations, could exceed our expectations and negatively impact our financial results. Product defects or problems with integrating our products with other vendors’ products used by our customers may seriously harm our business and reputation. We produce complex products that can contain latent defects or performance problems. This could happen to both existing and new products. Such defects or performance problems could result in litigation against us and be detrimental to our business and reputation. In addition, customers frequently integrate our products with other vendors’ products. When problems occur in a combined environment, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. These problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and cause significant customer relationship issues, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Disruptions in the supply of certain key components and other goods from our suppliers, including limited or single source suppliers, could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single source of supply. If a single source supplier decides to stop producing a key component for us, or if the receipt of certain limited source or single source materials is otherwise delayed, our relationship with customers may be harmed if such decisions or delays cause us to miss our scheduled shipment deadlines. Our current or alternative sources may not be able to continue to meet all of our demands on a timely basis. If suppliers or subcontractors experience difficulties or fail to meet our manufacturing requirements, our business would be harmed until we are able to secure alternative sources, if any, on commercially reasonable terms. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations, damage our relationships with customers, or even lead to permanent loss of customer orders. In addition, certain of our businesses buy components, including limited or sole source items, from competitors of our other businesses. This dynamic may adversely impact our relationship with these suppliers. For example, these suppliers could increase the price of those components or reduce their supply of those components to us, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business operations or lead to permanent loss of customer orders. 18 If we fail to accurately forecast component and raw material requirements for our products, we could incur additional costs and experience significant delays in shipments, whi ch could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. We use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our production requirements. It is important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials to manufacture our products. Lead times for our components and raw materials vary significantly and depend on factors including the specific supplier requirements, the size of the order, contract terms and current market demand. For substantial increases in our sales levels of certain products, some of our suppliers may need significant lead time. If we overestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have excess inventory, which would increase our costs. If we underestimate our component and raw material requirements, we may have inadequate inventory, which could interrupt and delay delivery of our products to customers. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our results of operations and damage our relationships with customers. Production difficulties and product delivery delays or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business. We assemble our products at our facilities in the U.S., the U. K., Germany and China. Each of our products is typically manufactured in a single manufacturing location. If production activities at any of our manufacturing facilities were disrupted by a natural disaster or otherwise, our operations would be negatively impacted until we could establish alternative production and service operations. Significant production difficulties could be the result of: • mistakes made while transferring manufacturing processes between locations; • changing process technologies; • ramping production; • installing new equipment at our manufacturing facilities; • implementing new information technology systems; • shortage of key components; and • loss of electricity or employees’ access to the manufacturing facilities due to man-made and natural disasters. From time to time, we determine to consolidate certain of our manufacturing facilities, or otherwise move our production of certain products to another facility. Moving complicated manufacturing facilities involves various risks, including the inability to commence production within the cost and timeframe estimated, damage to equipment, inability to produce a high-quality product, shipping delays, distraction to management and employees, and the inability to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel. Failure to successfully move manufacturing facilities due to these and other unforeseen risks could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand, harm our relationships with customers, and adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. In addition, we may experience product delivery delays in the future. We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies. We also ship our products through national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and local delivery practices. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experience significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with customers. We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Some of our products and the related sales and marketing development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDCA, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive) and to obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could: • take a significant period of time; 19 • require the expenditure of substantial resources; • involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance; • require changes to products; and • result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order for us to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements. In addition, on April 5, 2017, the European Parliament passed the Medical Devices Regulation (the “MDR”) which repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) member states, the regulations are directly applicable (i.e., without the need for adoption of EEA member state laws implementing them) in all EEA member states and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA member states. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and in vitro diagnostic devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR will, however, only become applicable three years after publication. Once applicable, the new regulations will, among other things: • strengthen the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available; • establish explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; • improve the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; • set up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the European Union; and • strengthen rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market. We face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the European Commission and EEA competent authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order recall, repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of healthcare professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDCA and regulations pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field 20 actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our products and operations are subject to various foreign, U.S. federal, and state healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties. Our products and our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various foreign, U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, anti-kickback, false claims and privacy statutes. These laws may restrict, among other things, the development, sales, marketing and distribution of our products. These laws include: • the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; • federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors; • the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPPA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; • HIPAA as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; • the federal physician “sunshine” requirements under PPACA, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members; • state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require device manufacturers to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Efforts to ensure that our business operations comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products. Several of our customers rely on third party payors, such as government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used. The continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce those costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors for procedures in which our products are used. If that occurred, sales of medical devices may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our products, or demand further price reductions. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes to reform healthcare systems. For example, PPACA imposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, although the 21 effective rate paid may be lower. Through a series of legislative amendments, the excise tax was suspended through December 31, 2019. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the PPACA was invalid due to the legislative repeal of the individual mandate. While the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals, if any, and other efforts to repeal and replace the PPACA will i mpact the PPACA and our business. There may be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. Other elements of health care reform such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially adversely impact numerous aspects of our business, results of operations and financial condition. Changes in go vernmental regulations related to our business or our products could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. We are subject to many governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, the laser radiation safety regulations of the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act administered by the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, a branch of the FDA, and certain health regulations related to the manufacture of products using beryllium, an element used in some of our products. Among other things, these regulations require us to file annual reports, to maintain quality control and sales records, to perform product testing, to distribute appropriate operating manuals, to conduct safety reviews, to incorporate design and operating features in products sold to end-users, and to certify and label our products. Depending on the class of the product, various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices must be installed. We are also subject to regulatory oversight, including comparable enforcement mechanisms, in the markets we serve. We compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal, state, local and international regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations. Any significant changes in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could result in significant costs. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process or the recycling of products we manufacture. We are subject to regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency in the U.S. and comparable authorities in other countries. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to regulatory fines. Future developments, administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. It is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. Certain regulations may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. These redesigns may adversely affect the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions and reduce our profitability. If we fail to implement new information technology systems successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on centralized information systems throughout the Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. We are in the process of upgrading our information technology infrastructure, including implementing new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) systems and other complementary information technology systems. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the upgrades and new ERP systems. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the transition, design and implementation of the upgrades and new ERP systems, particularly any disruptions, delays or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may experience difficulties as we transition to these new upgraded systems and processes, including loss of data and the ability to process customer orders, ship products, provide services and support to our customers, issue sales invoices, collect accounts receivable, fulfill contractual obligations, satisfy internal and external financial reporting requirements in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement these systems and become familiar with the new systems. In addition, as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our information technology infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time. Furthermore, the transition, design and implementation of upgrades and new ERP systems may be much more costly than we anticipated. Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets. As of December 31, 2018, we had $360.6 million of net intangible assets, including goodwill, on our consolidated balance sheet. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill, customer relationships, patents, trademarks, core technologies and technology 22 licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impair ment at least on an annual basis. All other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible assets. Adverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our businesses may result in an impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to additional bad debt expense. There can be no assurance that our open credit customers will pay the amounts they owe to us or that the reserves we maintain will be adequate to cover such credit exposures. In addition, to the extent that turmoil in the credit markets or increases in interest rates make it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, their ability to pay may be adversely impacted. Our customers’ failure to pay and/or our failure to maintain sufficient reserves could have a material adverse effect on our future cash flows and financial condition. Our reliance upon third party distribution channels subjects us to credit, inventory, business concentration, and business failure risks beyond our control. We sell many of our products through resellers, distributors, and system integrators. As these third parties tend to have more limited financial resources than OEM and end-user customers, they generally represent sources of increased credit risk. Any downturn in the business of our resellers, distributors, and systems integrators would in turn harm our results of operations and financial condition. Our sales also depend upon the ability of our OEM customers to develop and sell systems that incorporate our products. Adverse economic conditions, large inventory positions, limited marketing resources and other factors influencing these OEM customers could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial results. We cannot assure investors that our OEM customers will not experience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Relating to Taxes Novanta Inc. may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation even though it is a non-U.S. corporation. Novanta, Inc. is a holding company organized in Canada and is subject to Canadian tax laws. However, we are also subject to U.S. tax rules and file U.S. federal income tax returns for our operations in the U.S. In addition, distributions or payments from entities in one jurisdiction to entities in another jurisdiction may be subject to income and/or withholding taxes. We do not intend to operate in a manner that will cause Novanta, Inc. to be treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business or otherwise be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its income, but it generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on certain U.S.-sourced passive income items, such as dividends and certain types of interest. Tax audits by tax authorities could adversely affect future results. We are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, net income and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation, which could impact our financial position and earnings per share. Our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the effective income tax rate for each year is a function of (a) taxable income levels in numerous tax jurisdictions, (b) our ability to utilize recognized deferred tax assets, (c) taxes, interest, or penalties resulting from tax audits and, (d) credits and deductions as a percentage of total taxable income. From time to time, the U.S., foreign and state governments make substantive changes to tax rules where significant judgment is required to determine the impact of such changes on our provision for income taxes, which may result in increased costs. Further, such tax law changes may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods. 23 Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure We may require additional capital to adequately respond to business challenges or opportunities and repay or refinance our existing indebtedness, but this capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to adequately respond to future business challenges or opportunities, including, but not limited to, the need to develop new products or enhance our existing products, maintaining or expanding research and development projects, the need to build inventory or to invest other cash to support business growth, and opportunities to acquire complementary businesses and technologies. As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding debt of $209.6 million under the amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) and $189.9 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. If we are unable to satisfy the conditions in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our needs exceed the amounts available under the revolving credit facility, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to obtain additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution. Any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of the holders of our common shares. Further, our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts our ability to obtain additional debt financing from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us when we need it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In addition, the terms of any additional equity or debt issuances may adversely affect the value and price of our common shares. Global credit conditions have varied widely over the past decade and could continue to vary significantly in the future. Although these conditions have not affected our current plans, adverse credit conditions in the future could have a material negative impact on our ability to execute on future strategic initiatives. Our existing indebtedness could adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had $209.6 million of outstanding debt. This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: • reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; • limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, changes in the general economic environment, and market changes in the industries in which we operate; and • placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. Some of these balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt. Our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our borrowings thereunder. The market price for our common shares may be volatile. The market price of our common shares could be subject to wide fluctuations. These fluctuations could be caused by: • quarterly variations in our results of operations; • changes in earnings estimates by analysts; • conditions in the markets we serve; or • general market or economic conditions. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices of many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These market fluctuations could adversely affect the price of our common shares. 24 Certain provisions of our corporate documents may delay or prevent a change in control o f the Company. Our corporate documents and our existence as a corporation under the laws of New Brunswick subject us to provisions of Canadian law that may enable our Board of Directors to resist a change in control of the Company. These provisions include: • limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of shareholders; • the ability to issue an unlimited number of common shares; and • advance notice procedures required for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders. These anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of the Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions that shareholders desire. In addition, under New Brunswick law, cumulative voting is mandatory in director elections which can result in stockholders holding less than a majority of shares being able to elect persons to the Board of Directors and prevent a majority stockholder from controlling the election of all of the directors. Risks Relating to Our Internal Controls If we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business. While our management and our independent registered public accounting firm concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018, it is possible that material weaknesses may be identified in the future. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or to comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common shares, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our internal control and financial reporting requirements or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect the trading price of our common shares and our business. Material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain. As part of our growth strategy, we may make additional acquisitions of privately held businesses. Prior to becoming part of our consolidated company, the acquired businesses would not be required to implement or maintain the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting that are required of public companies. We are required to integrate the acquired businesses into our consolidated company’s system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot provide assurance as to how long the integration process may take for our recently acquired businesses or any businesses that we may acquire in the future. Additionally, we may need to improve our internal control or those of any business we acquire and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls in order to make such improvements. This could result in significant costs to us and could require us to divert substantial resources, including management time and attention, from other activities. Item 1B.

The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 during 2015. Amounts prior to 2015 have been revised to conform with this presentation. (3) In 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum, which increased our ownership position in Laser Quantum from approximately 41% to approximately 76%. The noncontrolling interest was considered a redeemable equity instrument and was presented as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet at the greater of the carrying value or the estimated redemption value of the noncontrolling interest. In 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum. 31 Ite m 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The MD&A contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, our belief that the Purchasing Managers Index (“PMI”) may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial end market; our strategy; anticipated financial performance; expected liquidity and capitalization; drivers of revenue growth and our growth expectations in various markets; management’s plans and objectives for future operations, expenditures and product development, and investments in research and development; business prospects; potential of future product releases and expansion of our product and service offerings; anticipated revenue performance; industry trends; market conditions; our competitive positions; changes in economic and political conditions; changes in accounting principles; changes in actual or assumed tax liabilities; expectations regarding tax exposures; anticipated reinvestment of future earnings and dividend policy; anticipated expenditures in regard to the Company’s benefit plans; future acquisitions, integration and anticipated benefits from acquisitions and dispositions; anticipated economic benefits and expected costs of restructuring programs; ability to repay our indebtedness; our intentions regarding the use of cash; expectations regarding legal and regulatory environmental requirements and our compliance thereto; and other statements that are not historical facts. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The words “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “intends,” “future,” “could,” “estimates,” “plans,” “would,” “should,” “potential,” “continues,” and similar words or expressions (as well as other words or expressions referencing future events, conditions or circumstances) identify forward looking statements. Readers should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Management and the Company disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in its expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward looking statements, except as required under applicable law. Business Overview Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as, the “Company”, “Novanta”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. We combine deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables us to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to our customers' demanding applications. End Markets We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market. Advanced Industrial Market For the year ended December 31, 2018, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. Medical Market For the year ended December 31, 2018, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of our revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 32 Strategy Our strategy is to drive sustainable, profitable growth through short-term and long-term initiatives, including: • disciplined focus on our diversified business model of providing functionality to long life-cycle OEM customer platforms in attractive medical and advanced industrial niche markets; • improving our business mix to increase medical sales as a percentage of total revenue by: - introducing new products aimed at attractive medical applications, such as minimally invasive and robotic surgery, ophthalmology, patient monitoring, drug delivery, clinical laboratory testing and life science equipment; - deepening our key account management relationships with and driving cross selling of our product offerings to leading medical equipment manufacturers; and - pursuing complementary medical technology acquisitions; • increasing our penetration of high growth advanced industrial applications, such as laser materials processing, robotics, automation and metrology, by working closely with OEM customers to launch application specific products that closely match the requirements of each application; • broadening our portfolio of enabling proprietary technologies and capabilities through increased investment in new product development, expanded sales and marketing channels to reach target customers, and investments in application development to further penetrate existing customers, while expanding the applicability of our solutions to new markets; • broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions in medical and advanced industrial technology applications, including increasing our recurring revenue streams such as services, spare parts and consumables; • improving our existing operations to expand profit margins and improve customer satisfaction by implementing lean manufacturing principles and strategic sourcing across our major production sites; and • attracting, retaining, and developing world-class talented and motivated employees. Significant Events and Updates Acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited On May 1, 2018, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Zettlex Holdings Limited (“Zettlex”), a Cambridge, United Kingdom-based provider of inductive encoder products that provide absolute and accurate positioning, even in extreme operating environments, to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The purchase price of £23.3 million ($32.0 million), net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We expect that the addition of Zettlex will broaden the range of components and solutions that we can provide our customers by combining our commercial resources and application-specific competencies with Zettlex's technologies and strong team. Zettlex is included in our Precision Motion reportable segment. Acquisition of Remaining Equity Ownership in Laser Quantum On September 27, 2018, we acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. The acquisition of these noncontrolling interests was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The total purchase price was financed with cash on hand, borrowings under our credit facility, and the issuance of 213,219 shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of $14.4 million. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones as specified in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture. 33 Overview of Financial Results Total revenue for 2018 was $614.3 million, an increase of $93.0 million, or 17.8%, versus 2017. The effect of our acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 resulted in an increase in revenue of $52.9 million, or 10.2%. Foreign exchange rates positively impacted our revenue by $3.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2018. Operating income increased $13.4 million from $57.6 million in 2017 to $71.0 million in 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of $41.0 million as a result of higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $27.5 million, primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.43 in 2018 increased $0.30 from an EPS of $1.13 in 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to higher operating income and a $22.0 million decrease in the Laser Quantum nontaxable redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment from 2017, partially offset by the $26.4 million nontaxable gain recognized from the acquisition of the additional approximately 35% of Laser Quantum equity interest in 2017. Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2018 was positively impacted by a $1.8 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, while Diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by a $20.2 million redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment. (See Note 10 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.) Specific components of our operating results for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are further discussed below.

Photonics Photonics segment gross profit for 2018 increased $11.0 million, or 10.4%, versus 2017, due to an increase in revenue. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 47.0% for 2018, compared with a gross profit margin of 45.7% for 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to changes in product mix, productivity improvements and reductions in cost of poor quality. Amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technologies also decreased $2.0 million, which resulted in a 0.8 percentage point increase in gross profit margin. 35 Photonics segment gross profit for 2017 increased $29.4 million, or 38.4%, versus 2016, due to an increase in revenue as a result of the Laser Quantum acq uisition and increased volumes in our legacy product lines. Photonics segment gross profit margin was 45.7% for 2017, compared with a gross profit margin of 44.0% for 2016. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the Laser Quantum acquisition. Gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively impacted by an increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technology of $3.2 million. Vision Vision segment gross profit for 2018 increased $17.9 million, or 25.9%, versus 2017, primarily due to full-year gross profit from WOM being included in 2018 results. Vision segment gross profit margin was 37.4% for 2018, compared with a gross profit margin of 37.8% for 2017. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a net decrease in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technologies of $1.9 million, which resulted in a 0.8 percentage point increase in gross profit margin. Vision segment gross profit for 2017 increased $22.1 million, or 46.8%, versus 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from the WOM, ThingMagic and Reach acquisitions, which increased gross profit by $17.6 million. Vision segment gross profit margin was 37.8% for 2017, compared with a gross profit margin of 38.6% for 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of developed technology of $6.1 million, which resulted in a 3.3 percentage point decrease in gross profit margin, partially offset by changes in product mix and cost savings from restructuring activities in 2016. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment gross profit for 2018 increased $12.9 million, or 27.7%, versus 2017, primarily due to an increase in revenue. Precision Motion segment gross profit margin was 45.0% for 2018, compared with a gross profit margin of 44.0% for 2017. The increase in gross profit margin was primarily related to changes in product mix.

R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to higher investments across the majority of our product lines and acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. R&D expenses were $41.7 million, or 8.0% of revenue, in 2017, versus $32.0 million, or 8.3% of revenue, in 2016. R&D expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to R&D expenses from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. 36 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include costs for sales and marketing, sales administration, finance, human resources, legal, information systems and executive management. SG&A expenses were $115.9 million, or 18.9% of revenue, in 2018, versus $101.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in 2017. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, and an increase in compensation as a result of higher headcount and stock-based compensation expense. SG&A expenses were $101.7 million, or 19.5% of revenue, in 2017, versus $81.3 million, or 21.1% of revenue, in 2016. SG&A expenses increased in terms of total dollars primarily due to acquisitions in 2016 and 2017, investments in sales and marketing resources and higher variable compensation associated with the Company’s financial performance. Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets Amortization of purchased intangible assets is charged to our Photonics, Vision and Precision Motion segments. Amortization of core technologies is included in cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of customer relationships, trademarks, backlog and other intangibles are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $15.6 million, or 2.5% of revenue, in 2018, versus $12.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2017 and 2018. Amortization of purchased intangible assets, excluding the amortization of developed technologies that is included in cost of revenue, was $12.1 million, or 2.3% of revenue, in 2017, versus $8.3 million, or 2.1% of revenue, in 2016. The increase, in terms of total dollars and as a percentage of revenue, was the result of acquired intangible assets from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. Restructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs Restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related charges primarily relate to our restructuring programs, acquisition related costs incurred for completed acquisitions, acquisition costs related to future potential acquisitions and failed acquisitions, and changes in fair value of contingent considerations. We recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $8.0 million in 2018, versus $7.5 million in 2017. The increase in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2017 was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2018 and 2019 restructuring programs, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition related charges of $1.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the acquisition of WOM in 2017. We recorded restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs of $7.5 million in 2017, versus $7.9 million in 2016. The decrease in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs versus 2016 was primarily due to a $2.6 million decrease in restructuring related charges as a result of the 2016 restructuring program which was substantially completed in 2016, partially offset by an increase in acquisition related charges of $2.2 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the WOM acquisition. Operating Income (Loss) by Segment The following table sets forth operating income (loss) by segment for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Operating Income (Loss) Photonics $ 59,285 $ 51,660 $ 35,217 Vision 8,991 7,883 (1,277 ) Precision Motion 31,674 27,146 21,101 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services (28,937 ) (29,123 ) (22,086 ) Total $ 71,013 $ 57,566 $ 32,955 37 Photonics Photonics segment operating income was $59.3 million, or 23.8% of revenue, in 2018, versus $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $11.0 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D expenses and SG&A expenses of $3.7 million. Photonics segment operating income was favorably affected by a $2.3 million decrease in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Photonics segment operating income was $51.7 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in 2017, versus $35.2 million, or 20.2% of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $29.4 million, partially offset by increases in operating expenses, primarily related to the Laser Quantum acquisition and increased volumes in our legacy product lines. Photonics segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively affected by a $7.1 million increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Vision Vision segment operating income was $9.0 million, or 3.9% of revenue, in 2018, versus $7.9 million, or 4.3% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit, partially offset by the inclusion of full-year operating expenses from WOM in 2018. Vision segment operating income was negatively affected by a $1.1 million net increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Vision segment operating income was $7.9 million, or 4.3% of revenue, in 2017, versus an operating loss of $1.3 million, or (1.0%) of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $22.1 million and a decrease in spending primarily related to our 2016 restructuring program, which was substantially completed in 2016, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses related to acquisitions in 2017. Vision segment operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negatively affected by a $6.0 million increase in amortization of inventory fair value adjustments and amortization of intangible assets. Precision Motion Precision Motion segment operating income was $31.7 million, or 24.0% of revenue, in 2018, versus $27.1 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in 2017. The increase in operating income in terms of total dollars was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $12.9 million, partially offset by an increase in R&D and SG&A expenses of $3.5 million and an increase in acquisition earn-out costs of $4.0 million associated with the Zettlex acquisition. Precision Motion segment operating income was $27.1 million, or 25.6% of revenue, in 2017, versus $21.1 million, or 23.9% of revenue, in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in gross profit of $6.5 million. Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services Unallocated corporate and shared services costs primarily represent costs of corporate and shared service functions and other public company costs that are not allocated to the operating segments, including certain restructuring and most acquisition related costs. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2018 decreased by $0.2 million, or 0.6%, from 2017. Unallocated corporate and shared services costs for 2017 increased by $7.0 million, or 31.9%, from 2016 primarily due to an increase in acquisition related costs of $2.3 million mostly attributable to an investment banking success fee related to the WOM acquisition, and an increase in SG&A expenses of $5.4 million as a result of higher headcount and higher variable compensation associated with the Company’s financial performance. Interest Income (Expense), Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), and Other Income (Expense), Net The following table sets forth interest income (expense), foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), and other income (expense) for 2018, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Interest income (expense), net $ (9,814 ) $ (7,165 ) $ (4,559 ) Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net 147 (447 ) 2,317 Other income (expense), net (44 ) (229 ) 1,809 Gain on acquisition of business — 26,409 — 38 Interest Income (Expense), Net Net interest expense was $9.8 million in 2018 versus $7.2 million in 2017. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels as a result of acquisitions in 2017 and 2018 and an increase in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.53% and 3.32% during 2018 and 2017, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $1.0 million and $0.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Net interest expense was $7.2 million in 2017 versus $4.6 million in 2016. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in average debt levels as a result of acquisitions in 2017, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our senior credit facilities. The weighted average interest rate on our Senior Credit Facilities was 3.32% and 3.52% during 2017 and 2016, respectively. Included in net interest expense was non-cash interest expense of approximately $0.8 million and $0.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the amortization of deferred financing costs on our debt. Foreign Exchange Transaction Gains (Losses), Net Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.1 million net gains in 2018 versus $0.4 million net losses in 2017 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen, and net realized gains from foreign currency contracts. Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses), net, were $0.4 million net losses in 2017 versus $2.3 million net gains in 2016 primarily due to changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar against the British Pound, Euro and Japanese Yen. Other Income (Expense), Net Net other expense was nominal in 2018 versus $0.2 million in 2017. The decrease in net other expense was primarily due to a decrease in net periodic pension costs of our frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan covering employees of a divested business. Other income (expense) was $0.2 million net other expense in 2017 versus $1.8 million net other income in 2016 primarily due to earnings from our equity-method investment in Laser Quantum reported in other income (expense) prior to 2017. In January 2017, we acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum. As a result of this acquisition, earnings from Laser Quantum have been consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date. Gain on Acquisition of Business The gain on acquisition of business in 2017 was related to a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million recognized upon gaining control of Laser Quantum in January 2017 as a result of acquiring an additional approximately 35% of its outstanding shares. Income Taxes We recorded a tax provision of $10.2 million in 2018, as compared to a tax provision of $13.8 million in 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 was 16.7% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 18.2% of income before taxes for 2017. Our effective tax rate in 2018 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with varying tax rates, including the benefit of the new 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate and $1.6 million of estimated deductions for Foreign Derived Intangible Income under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”), a $0.9 million benefit from share-based compensation, a $1.9 million U.K. patent box deduction and $1.3 million of other tax credits; offset by $0.8 million of non-deductible expenses recognized under an earn-out agreement in connection with the Zettlex acquisition. We recorded a tax provision of $13.8 million in 2017, as compared to a tax provision of $10.5 million in 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 was 18.2% of income before taxes, compared to an effective tax rate of 32.3% of income before taxes for 2016. Our effective tax rate in 2017 differs from the Canadian statutory rate of 29.0% primarily due to a $1.2 million tax effect of non-deductible acquisition related expenses and a $2.8 million provision for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 as a result of the Tax Reform Act, which reduced the U.S. federal statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. These increases were offset by a $2.0 million benefit from international tax rate differences, a $1.1 million benefit due to the Section 199 Domestic Production Activity deduction in the U.S., a $1.0 million benefit associated with R&D and foreign tax credits generated in 2017, recognition of $1.6 million net tax benefits from uncertain tax positions upon expiration of statute of limitations and conclusion of income tax audits, and a $1.6 million benefit from the patent box deduction in the U.K. In addition, in 2017, we reported a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million on our previously-held Laser Quantum equity interest and wrote off $1.5 million of Laser Quantum related deferred tax liability, which had a combined 8.7% favorable impact on our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017. 39 Liquidity and Capital Resources We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are funding operations, capital expenditures, investments in businesses, and repayment of our debt and related interest expense. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating and capital expenditure cash needs for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. The availability of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provides another potential source of liquidity for acquisitions. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of bonds, convertible debt or equity, to fund business development activities or other future investing cash requirements, subject to approval by the lenders in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Significant factors affecting the management of our ongoing cash requirements are the adequacy of available bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms. The sources of our liquidity are subject to all of the risks of our business and could be adversely affected by, among other factors, a decrease in demand for our products, our ability to integrate current and future acquisitions, deterioration in certain financial ratios, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and market changes in general. See “Risks Relating to Our Common Shares and Our Capital Structure” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations may be dependent upon the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. Local laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and transferring assets to us. We cannot assure you that applicable laws and regulations and/or the terms of our indebtedness will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans when necessary. As of December 31, 2018, $49.2 million of our $82.0 million cash and cash equivalents was held by our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Generally, our intent is to use cash held in these foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations or acquisitions by those local subsidiaries and to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Approximately 64.4% of our outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities (defined below) were held in our subsidiaries outside of Canada and the United States. Additionally, we may use intercompany loans to address short-term cash flow needs for various subsidiaries. In certain instances, we have identified excess cash for which we may repatriate and have established liabilities for the expected tax cost. Because of the ownership structure of the Company, our foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings (the “Toll Charge”) under the Tax Reform Act. Share Repurchase Plans In October 2013, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (the “2013 Repurchase Plan”) under which we could repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of $10.0 million. During 2018, we repurchased 89 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.9 million at an average price of $65.43 per share under the 2013 Repurchase Plan. As of December 31, 2018, we had repurchased a cumulative total of 385 thousand shares under the 2013 Repurchase Plan for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million at an average price of $25.97 per share. As of December 31, 2018, we had completed the 2013 Repurchase Plan. In October 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $25.0 million worth of common shares. We expect that share repurchases will be made under the 2018 Repurchase Plan pursuant to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had $25.0 million available for share repurchases under the 2018 Repurchase Plan as of December 31, 2018. Under the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at our discretion, based on its ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of our common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be purchased when we would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations. Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement In May 2016, we entered into the second amended and restated senior secured credit agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), consisting of a $75.0 million, 5-year term loan facility and a $225.0 million, 5-year revolving credit 40 facility (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facilities”). The Senior Credit Facilities mat ure in May 2021. In August 2017, we entered into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility commitment from $225 milli on to $325 million and reset the accordion feature to $125 million for future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of $2.3 milli on beginning in October 2017, with the remaining amount due upon maturity. We may make payments to pay down our revolving credit facility with cash on hand and cash generated from future operations. On February 26, 2018, we entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00. Certain other technical changes were made to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as a result of the Fourth Amendment and are not considered material. As of December 31, 2018, we had a term loan of $74.5 million and revolving loans of $135.1 million outstanding under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various covenants that we believe are usual and customary for this type of agreement, including a maximum allowed leverage ratio and a minimum required fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). The following table summarizes these financial covenants and our compliance therewith as of December 31, 2018: Requirement Actual December 31, 2018 Maximum consolidated leverage ratio 3.50 1.66 Minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 1.50 5.11 In addition, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various other customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on certain payments; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents totaled $82.0 million at December 31, 2018, versus $100.1 million at December 31, 2017. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents is primarily attributable to debt repayments of $74.6 million, acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum of $30.8 million, current year business acquisitions of $29.6 million, and capital expenditures of $14.7 million. These cash outflows were offset by cash provided by operating activities of $89.6 million and borrowings under our revolving credit facility of $55.3 million. The following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash flows and unused borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility for the years indicated (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Cash and cash equivalents, end of year $ 82,043 $ 100,057 $ 68,108 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 89,647 $ 63,378 $ 47,788 Net cash used in investing activities $ (45,590 ) $ (177,380 ) $ (12,865 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (60,164 ) $ 143,330 $ (23,189 ) Unused borrowing capacity available under revolving credit facility, end of year $ 189,942 $ 175,547 $ 215,000 Operating Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $89.6 million in 2018, versus $63.4 million in 2017. Cash provided by operating activities in 2018 increased from 2017 primarily due to the increase in operating income. Cash provided by operating activities for 2018 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding and an increase in accrued expenses. The Company’s growth in revenue of $93.0 million and gross profit of $41.0 million increased our outstanding trade receivables and inventories, which negatively impacted our cash provided by operating activities. 41 Cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was positively impacted by an increase in our outstanding payables and accrued expenses. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in outstanding trade receivables and an increase in inventories, excluding trade rece ivables and inventories acquired from acquisitions in 2017, and an increase in income tax payments . Cash provided by operating activities for 2016 was positively impacted by an increase in our days payables outstanding from 41 days at December 31, 2015 to 53 days at December 31, 2016 and improvement in our inventory turnover ratio from 3.6 at December 31, 2015 to 3.7 at December 31, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by an increase in our days sales outstanding from 57 days at December 31, 2015 to 59 days at December 31, 2016. In January 2019, we paid £3.0 million ($3.9 million) as the first installment under our earn-out obligations in connection with the Zettlex acquisition, which will be reported as cash used in operating activities in the first quarter of 2019. Investing Cash Flows Cash used in investing activities was $45.6 million during 2018, primarily related to $29.6 million in cash outflows (net of cash acquired of $3.8 million) related to acquisitions in 2018 and $14.7 million in capital expenditures. Cash used in investing activities was $177.4 million during 2017, primarily driven by our acquisitions of WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum. In connection with these acquisitions, we paid $185.0 million in cash considerations, which is reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows as $168.3 million cash outflows from investing activities (net of cash acquired of $16.7 million and working capital adjustments). We also paid $9.1 million for capital expenditures during 2017. Cash used in investing activities was $12.9 million during 2016, primarily due to $13.4 million in cash consideration paid for the Reach acquisition and the acquisition of certain developed technology assets, and $8.5 million in cash paid for capital expenditures, partially offset by $3.6 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Orlando, Florida facility in March 2016, $3.4 million in net cash consideration received from the sale of our Chatsworth, California facility in August 2016, $0.4 million received from the finalization of the Lincoln Laser acquisition working capital adjustments, and $1.5 million received from the release of escrow funds from our 2014 Scientific Lasers divestiture. We have no material commitments to purchase property, plant and equipment. We expect to use approximately $14 million to $16 million in 2019 for capital expenditures related to investments in new property, plant and equipment for our existing businesses. Financing Cash Flows Cash used in financing activities was $60.2 million during 2018, primarily due to $30.8 million of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum, $9.2 million of contractual term loan payments, $65.4 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $3.6 million of payroll tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, and $5.9 million of repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $55.3 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Zettlex and the remaining equity interest in Laser Quantum. Cash provided by financing activities was $143.3 million during 2017, primarily due to $176.8 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility used to fund a portion of the cash considerations paid for the WOM, ThingMagic and Laser Quantum acquisitions, partially offset by $7.9 million of contractual term loan payments, $19.0 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $2.5 million of contingent consideration payments, $2.1 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, $0.4 million of repurchases of our common shares and $0.9 million of principal payments under our capital lease obligations. We also paid $0.7 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Third Amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement entered into in August 2017. Cash used in financing activities was $23.2 million during 2016, primarily due to $7.5 million of contractual term loan payments, $8.8 million of optional repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $1.8 million of payroll withholding tax payments on stock-based compensation awards, $1.6 million of repurchases of our common shares, and $1.2 million of principal payments under our capital lease obligations. We also paid $2.5 million for debt issuance costs as a result of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement signed in May 2016. In 2019, we are contractually required to pay $4.6 million (comprised of two quarterly payments of $2.3 million) on our term loan facility and $0.6 million in principal payments under our capital lease obligations. In addition, we may pay down our term loan and revolving credit facility from time to time with available cash generated from future operating activities. 42 Other Liquidity Matters Pension Plans We maintain a defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. (the “U.K. Plan”). Our U.K. Plan was closed to new members in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, thereby limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointly or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) under the U.K. Plan of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Our funding policy is to fund pensions based on actuarial methods as permitted by regulatory authorities. The results of funding valuations depend on both the funding deficit and the assumptions used (such as asset returns, discount rates, mortality, retail price inflation and other market driven changes). The assumptions used represent one estimate of many possible future outcomes. The final cost to us will be determined by events as they actually become known. Due to the underfunded position that our U.K. Plan currently has and potential changes in the actual outcomes relative to the assumptions used in funding valuations, we may have to increase payments to fund this plan in the future. As of December 31, 2018, the projected benefit obligation under the U.K. Plan exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $3.8 million. Based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, the Company’s annual contributions are expected to be approximately $0.9 million in 2019 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter. As a result of the covenant that exists between our U.K. subsidiary and the Plan Trustees regarding the funding of the U.K. Plan, our ability to transfer assets outside our U.K. subsidiary, and its wholly owned subsidiary in China, may be limited. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2018 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future years. We have excluded the future cash payments for unrecognized tax benefits of $4.5 million, including interest and penalties, because we are uncertain if and when such amounts may be settled. These unrecognized tax benefits are further explained in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The term loan is payable in quarterly installments of $2.3 million with the final installment of $56.1 million due upon maturity in May 2021. As of December 31, 2018, the contractually required quarterly payments for the first two quarters of 2019 had been prepaid. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility are due at maturity in May 2021. (2) For the purpose of this calculation, current interest rates on floating rate obligation (LIBOR plus applicable margin, as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) were used for the remainder contractual life of both the term loan and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. (3) These amounts primarily represent the gross amounts due for facilities that are leased. The amounts include payments due with respect to both active operating facilities and idle facilities that have been vacated. (4) Purchase commitments represent purchase obligations as of December 31, 2018. 43 (5) A mounts shown represent funding obligations equivalent to $0.9 million per year, increasing 2.9% through 202 2 based on annual funding contributions in effect as of December 31, 201 8 . Future funding requirements will be subject to change as a result of future changes in various actuarial assumptions and actual investment returns on plan assets. (6) These amounts represent the estimated contingent consideration and earn-out payments accrued in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 that are expected to be paid between 2019 and 2022. The undiscounted range of the possible contingent consideration and earn-out payments is zero to $17.5 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Through December 31, 2018, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements or material transactions with unconsolidated entities or other persons. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory valuation, assessment of the valuation of goodwill, intangible assets and tangible long-lived assets, contingent consideration obligations, employee benefit plans, restructuring charges, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for loss contingencies. Actual results in the future could differ significantly from our estimates. We believe that the following critical accounting policies and estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult and subjective judgments. Revenue Recognition. Beginning January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2014-09” or “Topic 606”) using the modified retrospective method. Under Topic 606, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. This generally occurs upon shipment when the title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of our revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of our customers, we may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and total less than 3% of our consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. We occasionally sell separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. We recognize the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. We generally provide warranties for our products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for our Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as we have the ability to ascertain the likelihood of 44 the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. Our estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of futu re conditions. To the extent our experienc e in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability are recorded at that time, with an offsetting entry recorded to cost of revenue. We expense incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. We do not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. Inventories . Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our forecasted product demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historical levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, which would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower cost of revenue and higher income from operations than expected in that period. Share-Based Compensation. We record expenses associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the vesting period of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We grant two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). For EPS-PSUs, share-based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that specified performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if ne cessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to the probability of achieving performance targets. For TSR-PSUs, we recognize the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, which is determined using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model as of the date of grant. The expense related to TSR-PSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period, which is generally three years. The Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the performance conditions stipulated in the grant agreement and calculates the fair market value for the market-based restricted stock units granted. The Monte Carlo simulation model also uses stock price volatility and other variables to estimate the probability of satisfying the performance conditions, including the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, and the resulting fair value of the award. Valuation of Long-lived Assets. The purchase price we pay for acquired companies is allocated first to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value. Any excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill. We make various assumptions and estimates in order to assign fair value to acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. These assumptions typically include cash flow forecasts, discount rates, technology royalty rates, and customer attrition rates, among others. Actual cash flows may vary from forecasts used to value these assets at the time of the business combination. Our most significant identifiable intangible assets are customer relationships, acquired technologies, trademarks and trade names. In addition to our review of the carrying value of each asset, the useful life assumption for each asset, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived,” are reviewed on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other.” During the second quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-14, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04” or “Topic 350”), which eliminates Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. We test our goodwill balances annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an 45 impairment may exist. Should the fair value of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets decline because of reduced operating performance, market declines, or othe r indicators of impairment, or as a result of changes in the discount rate, charges for impairment loss may be necessary. We evaluate our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is generally at least one level below our reportable segments. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, we review factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If we elect this option and believe, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill is not recoverable, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of our reporting units to the fair value of these reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method. The DCF approach requires that we forecast future cash flows for each of the reporting units and discount the cash flow streams based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that is derived, in part, from comparable companies within similar industries. The DCF calculations also include a terminal value calculation that is based upon an expected long-term growth rate for the applicable reporting unit. The carrying values of each reporting unit include assets and liabilities which relate to the reporting unit’s operations. Additionally, reporting units that benefit from corporate assets or liabilities are allocated a portion of those corporate assets and liabilities on a proportional basis. We assess indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if impairment indicators are identified. We also periodically reassess their continuing classification as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Impairment exists if the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. An impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded to reduce the carrying value to its fair value. We evaluate amortizable intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with ASC 360-10-35-15, “Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the reporting units may exceed the undiscounted cash flow forecasts attributable to the reporting units. If undiscounted cash flow forecasts indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, a fair value assessment is performed. For intangible assets, fair value estimates are derived from discounted cash flow forecasts. For other long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment), fair value estimates are derived from the sources most appropriate for the particular asset and have historically included such approaches as sales comparison approach and replacement cost approach. If fair value is less than carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. We also review the useful life and residual value assumptions for definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Factors which may trigger an impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets include the following: • significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; • changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; • long-term negative industry or economic trends; • technological changes or developments; • changes in competition; • loss of key customers or personnel; • adverse judicial or legislative outcomes or political developments; • significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period of time; and • the decline of our market capitalization below net book value as of the end of any reporting period. The occurrence of any of these events or any other unforeseeable events or circumstances that materially affect future operating results or cash flows may cause an impairment that is material to our results of operations or financial position in the reporting period in which it occurs or is identified. 46 The most recent annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test was performed as of the beginning of the second quarter of 201 8 , using a qualitative assessment, noting no impairment. As of December 31, 201 8 , there were no indicators of impairment of our long-lived assets. We have a significant amount of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. The following table shows the breakdown of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment by reportable segment as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Goodwill Intangible Assets, net Property, Plant & Equipment, net Photonics $ 66,494 $ 45,689 $ 17,850 Vision 123,295 82,829 33,003 Precision Motion 27,873 14,402 10,131 Unallocated Corporate and Shared Services — — 4,480 Total $ 217,662 $ 142,920 $ 65,464 Pension Plans . Our subsidiary located in the U.K. maintains a defined benefit pension plan (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing for additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003, limiting our obligation to benefits earned through that date. Benefits under this plan were based on the employees’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen, adjusted for inflation. At December 31, 2018, the fair market value of the plan assets was $33.1 million, which was $3.8 million, or 10.2%, less than the projected benefit obligation of $36.9 million. The cost and obligations of our U.K. Plan are calculated using many assumptions. Major assumptions used in the accounting for this pension plan include the discount rate, rate of inflation, mortality rate and expected return on plan assets. Assumptions are determined each year based on data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with a third-party actuary. Should any of these assumptions change, they would have an effect on net periodic pension cost and the unfunded benefit obligation as of the end of the year. The most sensitive assumption affecting the determination of our U.K. Plan pension obligation is the discount rate. A 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 would change the pension obligation by $3.2 million. Accounting for Income Taxes . As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to calculate our income tax provision (benefit) in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our current income tax provision (benefit) together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are reported on our consolidated balance sheet. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate outcome is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made. We record a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets would be recorded and would increase our net income in the period such determination is made. Likewise, should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets will be recorded and will reduce our net income in the period such determination is made. In conjunction with our ongoing review of our actual results and anticipated future earnings, we continuously reassess the adequacy of the valuation allowance currently in place on our deferred tax assets. In 2018, we released valuation allowance of $0.3 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. The decrease of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which may result in proposed assessments. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or 47 resolved, or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires. As of December 31, 20 18 , the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 4.7 million, of which $ 3. 6 million would favorably affect our effective tax rate, if recognized. Over the next twelve months, we may need to record up to $ 0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits in the event of statute of limitations closures . Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018. The estimated unrecognized income and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $0.3 million. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Reform Act. The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system, providing a one-time transition Toll Charge on foreign earnings, creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and modifying the officer’s compensation limitation. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the newly enacted 21% U.S. corporate income tax rate. Because of the ownership structure of the Company, our foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time transition Toll Charge under the Tax Reform Act. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in 2017 in connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act is complete as of December 31, 2018. Loss Contingencies. We are subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the financial statement. As additional information becomes available, we will reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We expense legal fees as incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, which could affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities. We address market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk and Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could affect our operating results as well as our financial position and cash flows. The foreign currencies to which we have the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, British Pound and Japanese Yen. The Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows the Company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances. The primary foreign currency denominated transactions include revenue and expenses and the resulting accounts receivable and accounts payable balances reflected on our consolidated balance sheet and with intercompany trading partners that are eliminated in consolidation. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign currency contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We do not enter into or hold 48 foreign currency derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes , nor do we enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge f uture cash flows or forecasted transactions. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses on the underlying exposures from these currencies with gains and losses resulting from the foreign currency contracts that hedge these exposures. We had foreign currency contracts with notional amounts totaling $31.2 million and a fair value of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2018. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $2.5 million increase in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2018. By contrast, a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies would result in an approximately $2.5 million decrease in the fair value of our foreign currency contracts as of December 31, 2018. Interest Rates Our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations. We have $209.6 million of outstanding variable rate debt as of December 31, 2018. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2018 would increase our annual pre-tax interest expense by approximately $2.1 million. 49 Ite m 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data NOVANTA INC. INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm – PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 51 Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 53 Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 54 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 55 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 56 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 57 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 58 50 Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Novanta Inc.: Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers in 2018. Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 51 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that contro ls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 27, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013. 52 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 1. Organization and Presentation Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Novanta”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) is a leading global supplier of core technology solutions that give medical and advanced industrial original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) a competitive advantage. Novanta combines deep proprietary technology expertise and competencies in photonics, vision and precision motion with a proven ability to solve complex technical challenges. This enables Novanta to engineer core components and sub-systems that deliver extreme precision and performance, tailored to the customers’ demanding applications. Basis of Presentation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company in United States (“U.S.”) dollars and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., applied on a consistent basis. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Novanta Inc. and its subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Prior to January 10, 2017, the Company had an approximately 41% ownership interest in Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”), a privately held company located in the United Kingdom, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized income from its equity method investment amounting to $0.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively, which was included in other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum. As a result of this transaction, the Company’s ownership position in Laser Quantum increased from approximately 41% to approximately 76%. Since January 10, 2017, Laser Quantum has been consolidated in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On September 27, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million in cash and restricted stock. 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary. The Company evaluates its estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Foreign Currency Translation The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries outside the U.S. have been translated into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from foreign currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. Accordingly, gains and losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements are reported as cumulative translation adjustments, a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses, from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies, are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. 58 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amounts, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the Company’s best estimate of probable credit losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The Company determines the allowance based on a variety of factors, including the age of amounts outstanding relative to their contractual due date, specific customer factors, and other known risks and economic trends. Charges related to the allowance for doubtful accounts are included as selling, general and administrative expenses and are recorded in the period that the outstanding receivables are determined to be uncollectible. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the Company believes it is certain that the receivable will not be recovered. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows (in thousands): 2018 2017 2016 Balance at beginning of year $ 554 $ 565 $ 500 Provision charged to selling, general and administrative expenses 66 283 135 Allowance resulting from acquisitions — 52 15 Write-offs, net of recoveries of amounts previously reserved (295 ) (358 ) (82 ) Exchange rate changes (4 ) 12 (3 ) Balance at end of year $ 321 $ 554 $ 565 Inventories Inventories, which include materials and conversion costs, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Cost includes the cost of purchased materials, inbound freight charges, external and internal processing and applicable labor and overhead costs. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product. The Company records a charge to cost of revenue for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the net realizable value. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, adjusted for any impairment, less accumulated depreciation. The Company uses the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation of its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives range from 3 to 30 years for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of their useful lives or the lease terms, including any renewal period options that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Certain costs to develop software for internal use are capitalized when the criteria under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350-40, “Internal-Use Software,” are met. Lease arrangements meeting the criteria of ASC 840-30, “Leases – Capital Leases,” are capitalized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments and depreciated over the term of the lease. Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities acquired in a business combination. Allocations of the purchase price are based upon a valuation of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized but are assessed for impairment at least annually to ensure their current fair values exceed their carrying values. The Company’s most significant intangible assets are customer relationships, patents and developed technologies, trademarks and trade names. The fair values of intangible assets are based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of the acquired companies and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. All definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the periods in which their economic benefits are expected to be realized. The Company reviews the useful life assumptions, including the classification of certain intangible assets as “indefinite-lived”, on a periodic basis to determine if changes in circumstances warrant revisions to them. Costs associated with patent and intellectual property applications, renewals or extensions are expensed as incurred. 59 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 The Company evaluates its goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment at the reporting unit level which is at least one level below our reportable segments. Impairment Charges Impairment analyses of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are conducted in accordance with ASC 350, “Intangibles —Goodwill and Other.” During the second quarter of 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-14, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment” (“ASU 2017-04”), which eliminates Step Two of the goodwill impairment test. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test annually as of the beginning of the second quarter or more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. In performing the qualitative assessment, the Company reviews factors both specific to the reporting unit and to the Company as a whole, such as financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the fair value of each reporting unit at the last valuation date. If the Company elects this option and believes, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the quantitative impairment test is required; otherwise, no further testing is required. Alternatively, the Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative impairment test. This approach requires a comparison of the carrying value of each of the Company’s reporting units to the estimated fair value of these reporting units. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated primarily using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) method with a weighted average cost of capital. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference. The Company assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the second quarter, and more frequently if indicators are present, or changes in circumstances suggest, that an impairment may exist. The Company will also reassess the continuing classification of these indefinite-lived intangible assets as indefinite-lived when circumstances change such that the useful life may no longer be considered indefinite. The fair values of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined using the relief from royalty method, based on forecasted revenues. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The carrying amounts of definite-lived long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable. The recoverability of the carrying value is generally determined by comparison of the asset group’s carrying value to its undiscounted future cash flows. When this test indicates a potential for impairment, a fair value assessment is performed. Once an impairment is determined and measured, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Revenue Recognition See Note 3 for the Company’s revenue recognition policy. Research and Development and Engineering Costs Research and development and engineering (“R&D”) expenses are primarily comprised of employee related expenses and cost of materials for R&D projects. These costs are expensed as incurred. Share-Based Compensation The Company records the expense associated with share-based compensation awards to employees and directors based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date. For share-based compensation awards that vest over time based on employment, the associated expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The Company also grants two types of performance-based awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP 60 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 e arnings per share performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs is recognized ratably over the vesting period when it is probable that the performance targets are expected to be achieved based on management’s projections. Management’s projections are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods when underlying factors change the evaluation of the probability of achieving the performance targets. When the estimated achievement levels are adjusted at a later date, a cumulative adjustment to the share-based compensation expense previously recognized would be required. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense associated with EPS-PSUs may differ significantly from period to period based on changes to the probability of achieving performance targets. Share-based compensation expense associated with TSR-PSUs is based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using the Monte-Carlo valuation model, as of the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the performance period. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred and were not material for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Restructuring, Acquisition and Divestiture Related Costs The Company accounts for its restructuring activities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations.” The Company makes assumptions related to the amounts of employee severance benefits and related costs, time period over which facilities will remain vacant, useful lives and residual value of long-lived assets, sublease terms, sublease rental rates and discount rates. Estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available at the time the obligation is recognized. These estimates are reviewed and revised as facts and circumstances dictate. Acquisition related costs incurred to effect a business combination, including finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, are expensed as incurred. Acquisition related costs also include expenses recognized under earn-out agreements in connection with acquisitions. Expenses associated with divestiture activities, including legal and professional fees directly related to the completion of a business divestiture, are expensed as incurred. Accounting for Income Taxes The asset and liability method is used to account for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the related tax benefits will not be realized in the future. Valuation allowances are reassessed periodically to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized in the future and that any valuation allowance should be released. The majority of the Company’s business activities are conducted through its subsidiaries outside of Canada. Earnings from these subsidiaries are generally indefinitely reinvested in the local businesses. Further, local laws and regulations may also restrict certain subsidiaries from paying dividends to their parents. As such, the Company generally does not accrue income taxes for the repatriation of such earnings in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” To the extent that there are excess accumulated earnings that the Company intends to repatriate from any such subsidiaries, the Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities on such foreign earnings. 61 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on the evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at each reporting date. For those tax positions with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information, the Company records a tax benefit. For those income tax positions tha t are not likely to be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company uses foreign currency contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The time duration of these foreign currency contracts approximates the underlying foreign currency transaction exposures, generally less than three months. These contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Changes in the fair value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in income before income taxes. 62 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Recent Accounting Pronouncements Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.” ASU 2018-05 allows SEC registrants to record provisional amounts in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 due to the complexities involved in accounting for the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”). Companies have up to one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act (the “measurement period”) to obtain, prepare, and analyze the information that is needed in order to complete the accounting under ASC Topic 740. Any provisional amounts or adjustments to provisional amounts during the measurement period should be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax provision (benefit) in the reporting period in which the amounts are determined. January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2018-05 during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU 2018-05 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 15. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 shall be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Reform Act is recognized. January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2018-02 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 63 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, “Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718).” ASU 2017-09 requires that an entity account for the effects of a modification unless (i) the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; (ii) the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified; and (iii) the classification of the modified award as an equity instr ument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified. ASU 2017-09 should be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2017-09 during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost.” ASU 2017-07 requires employers that offer or maintain defined benefit plans to disaggregate the service component from the other components of net periodic benefit cost and provides guidance on the presentation of the service component and the other components of net periodic benefit cost in the statement of operations. ASU 2017-07 should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of net periodic benefit cost in the statement of operations. January 1, 2018. The Company retrospectively adopted ASU 2017-07 during the first quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-07 resulted in the reclassification of $0.4 million of the Company’s net periodic benefit costs related to its frozen U.K. pension plan from Selling, general and administrative expenses into Other income (expense) in the consolidated statement of operations for both 2017 and 2016. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” ASU 2016-16 requires that an entity recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory in the period in which the transfer occurs. ASU 2016-16 shall be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 during the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption resulted in the reclassification of $2.5 million of prepaid income taxes and income taxes receivable, of which $2.2 million was recorded to Accumulated deficit and $0.3 million was recognized as net deferred tax assets, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these net deferred tax assets are utilized. 64 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).” In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Deferral of the Effective Date.” ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition,” and requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgements , and changes in judgements and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract. January 1, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. ASU 2014-09 has been applied to those contracts which had not been completed as of January 1, 2018 and all new contracts entered into by the Company subsequent to January 1, 2018. All prior period financial statements and disclosures are presented in accordance with Topic 605. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 did not have an impact on the Company’s Accumulated deficit. See Note 3. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step Two of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. ASU 2017-04 should be applied on a prospective basis. January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2017-04 during the second quarter of 2018. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities.” ASU 2017-12 amends and simplifies existing guidance in order to better align a company’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of hedge results in the financial statements. ASU 2017-12 should be applied to hedging relationships existing on the date of adoption. The effect of the adoption should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2017-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 65 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Standard Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) – Targeted Improvements.” ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for both finance and operating leases and to disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 should be applied as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements using a modified retrospective approach. ASU 2018-11 provides an additional (and optional) transition method which allows entities to apply ASU 2016-02 as of the adoption date and recognize a cumulat ive-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company will adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the modified retrospective method. The Company expects this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated balance sheets with the recognition of new right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all operating leases longer than one year in duration. Upon adoption, the Company estimates both assets and liabilities on the c onsolidated balance sheet will increase by approximately $32.0 million to $37.0 million. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact upon its consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Changes in lease population or changes in incremental borrowing rates may alter this estimate. The Company will expand the consolidated financial statement disclosures upon adoption of this standard. 3. Revenue The Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers. The transfer of control generally occurs upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. The vast majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from the sale of distinct products. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for such products, which is generally at contractually stated prices. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected concurrently with revenue generating activities are excluded from revenue. Performance Obligations Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time, upon shipment, rather than over time. At the request of its customers, the Company may perform professional services, generally for the maintenance and repair of products previously sold to those customers and for engineering services. Professional services are typically short in duration, mostly less than one month, and aggregate to less than 3% of the Company’s consolidated revenue. Revenue is typically recognized at a point in time when control transfers to the customer upon completion of professional services. These services generally involve a single distinct performance obligation. The consideration expected to be received in exchange for such services is normally the contractually stated amount. The Company occasionally sells separately priced non-standard/extended warranty services or preventative maintenance plans with the sale of products. The transfer of control over the service plans is over time. The Company recognizes the related revenue ratably over the terms of the service plans. The transaction price of a contract is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin. Shipping & Handling Costs The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities that occur after the transfer of control over the related goods as fulfillment activities rather than performance obligations. The shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue and the related costs are recorded in cost of revenue at the time of transfer of control. Warranties The Company generally provides warranties for its products. The standard warranty period is typically 12 months to 24 months for the Photonics and Precision Motion segments and 12 months to 36 months for the Vision segment. The standard warranty period for product sales is accounted for under the provisions of ASC 450, “Contingencies,” as the Company has the ability to ascertain the likelihood of the liability and can reasonably estimate the amount of the liability. A provision for the estimated cost related to warranty 66 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 is recorded to cost of revenue at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s estimate of costs to service the warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectations of future conditions. To the extent that the Company’s experience in warranty claims or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from the original estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability a re recorded at that time, with an offsetting adjustment to cost of revenue. Practical Expedients and Exemptions The Company expenses incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a financing component because the transfer of a promised good to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good are typically one year or less. The Company does not disclose the value of the remaining performance obligation for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less. Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and advance payments from customers, including amounts that are refundable. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the related revenue. As of December 31, 2018 and January 1, 2018 (the date of adoption of Topic 606), contract liabilities were $4.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to $3.2 million of revenue recognized during the period that was included in the contract liability balance at the date of adoption, partially offset by cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Disaggregated Revenue See Note 19 for the Company’s disaggregation of revenue by segment, geography and end market. 4. Business Combinations 2018 Acquisitions During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company acquired two businesses for total cash considerations of $33.5 million, including the acquisition of Zettlex Holdings Limited (""Zettlex""). The consolidated statement of operations includes the operating results of the businesses from the dates of acquisition. Zettlex On May 1, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Zettlex, a Cambridge, United Kingdom-based provider of inductive encoder products that provide absolute and accurate positioning, even in extreme operating environments, to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets. The purchase price of £23.3 million ($32.0 million), net of working capital adjustments, was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. The addition of Zettlex broadens the range of components and solutions that the Company can provide to customers by combining its commercial resources and application-specific competencies with Zettlex's technologies and strong team. Zettlex is included in the Company’s Precision Motion reportable segment. The acquisition of Zettlex has been accounted for as a business combination. The allocation of the purchase price is based upon a valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The fair values of intangible assets were based on valuations using an income approach, with estimates and assumptions provided by management of Zettlex and the Company. The process for estimating the fair values of identifiable intangible assets requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. The excess of the purchase price over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities was recorded as goodwill. 67 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 3,776 Accounts receivable 2,237 Inventories 928 Property, plant and equipment 2,590 Intangible assets 14,585 Goodwill 11,790 Other assets 145 Total assets acquired 36,051 Accounts payable 509 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 1,035 Deferred tax liabilities 2,481 Total liabilities assumed 4,025 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 32,026 Less: cash acquired 3,776 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 28,250 The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 3,027 10 years Customer relationships 9,494 15 years Trademarks and trade names 550 10 years Backlog 1,514 1 year Total $ 14,585 The purchase price allocation resulted in $14.6 million of identifiable intangible assets and $11.8 million of goodwill. As the Zettlex acquisition is an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) Zettlex’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; and (ii) cost improvements due to the integration of Zettlex operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of Zettlex were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on May 1, 2018. Zettlex contributed revenues of $8.3 million and a loss before income taxes of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Loss before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 included amortization of purchased intangible assets of $1.3 million and compensation expense of $4.4 million recognized under earn-out agreements. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of Zettlex, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2017, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2017. 68 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 2017 Acquisitions WOM On July 3, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of W.O.M. World of Medicine GmbH (“WOM”), a Berlin, Germany-based provider of medical insufflators, pumps, and related disposables for OEMs in the minimally invasive surgery market, for a total purchase price of €118.1 million ($134.9 million). The acquisition was financed with a €118.0 million ($134.8 million) draw-down on the Company’s revolving credit facility. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 1,400 Accounts receivable 11,807 Inventories 14,549 Property, plant and equipment 21,940 Intangible assets 59,732 Goodwill 55,632 Other assets 2,660 Total assets acquired 167,720 Accounts payable 4,398 Other liabilities 8,681 Deferred tax liabilities 19,707 Total liabilities assumed 32,786 Total assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed 134,934 Less: cash acquired 1,400 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 133,534 The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 21,586 10 years Customer relationships 35,634 12 years Trademarks and trade names 2,284 10 years Backlog 228 1 year Total $ 59,732 The purchase price allocation resulted in $59.7 million of identifiable intangible assets and $55.6 million of goodwill. As the WOM acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill was deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows attributable to: (i) WOM’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; and (ii) cost improvements due to expansion in scale. The operating results of WOM were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on July 3, 2017. WOM is included in the Company’s Vision reportable segment. Laser Quantum On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired an additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum, a Manchester, United Kingdom-based provider of solid state continuous wave lasers, ultrafast lasers, and optical light engines to OEMs in the medical market, for £25.5 million ($31.1 million) in cash consideration. The purchase price was financed with cash on hand and 69 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 a $30.0 million draw- down on the Company’s revolving credit facility. As a result of this transaction, the Company’s ownership position in Laser Quantum increased from approximately 41% to approximately 76%. As part of this transaction, the Company and the remaining shareholders of Laser Quantum entered into a call and put option agreement for the purchase and sale, in 2020, of all the remaining Laser Quantum shares held by the remaining shareholders, subject to certain conditions. The purchase price for the remaining shares would have been based on the proportionate share of the noncontrolling interest in Laser Quantum’s cash on hand as of December 31, 2019 and a multiple of Laser Quantum’s EBITDA for the twelve months ending December 31, 2019, as defined in the call and put option agreement. In connection with the purchase price allocation, upon gaining control over Laser Quantum, the Company recognized a nontaxable gain of $26.4 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The gain represented the excess of the fair value of the Company’s previously-held equity interest in Laser Quantum over its carrying value upon gaining control. The fair value of the approximately 41% equity interest previously held by the Company before the acquisition and the fair value of the approximately 24% noncontrolling interest held by the remaining shareholders of Laser Quantum after the acquisition were determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow method (an income approach), the guideline public company method (a market approach), and the subject company transaction method (a market approach). The subject company transaction method was based on the purchase price paid by the Company for the acquisition of the additional approximately 35% of the outstanding shares, while giving consideration to the control and/or minority nature of the subject equity interests. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Cash $ 15,343 Accounts receivable 2,739 Inventories 6,264 Property, plant and equipment 2,286 Intangible assets 38,955 Goodwill 31,168 Other assets 717 Total fair value of assets 97,472 Accounts payable 796 Other liabilities 2,068 Deferred tax liabilities 7,337 Total fair value of liabilities 10,201 Total fair value of assets, net of fair value of liabilities 87,271 Less: fair value of equity interest previously held by Novanta 34,637 Less: fair value of noncontrolling interest 21,582 Total purchase price paid by Novanta 31,052 Less: cash acquired 15,343 Purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 15,709 70 NOVANTA INC.

As the Laser Quantum acquisition was an acquisition of outstanding common shares, none of the resulting goodwill was deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted average useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flow potential attributable to: (i) Laser Quantum’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s broader customer base; and (ii) cost improvements due to expansion in scale. The operating results of Laser Quantum were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on January 10, 2017. Laser Quantum is included in the Company’s Photonics reportable segment. ThingMagic On January 10, 2017, the Company acquired from Trimble Inc. certain assets and liabilities that constituted the business of ThingMagic, a Woburn, Massachusetts-based provider of ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) radio frequency identification (“RFID”) modules and finished RFID readers to OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $19.1 million. The acquisition was financed with cash on hand and a $12.0 million draw-down on the Company’s revolving credit facility. The final purchase price allocation is as follows (in thousands): Amount Inventories $ 1,832 Intangible assets 7,423 Goodwill 9,929 Total assets acquired 19,184 Other liabilities 95 Total liabilities assumed 95 Total purchase price $ 19,089 The fair value of intangible assets is comprised of the following (dollar amounts in thousands): Weighted Average Estimated Fair Amortization Value Period Developed technologies $ 4,600 10 years Customer relationships 2,520 10 years Trademarks and trade names 303 5 years Total $ 7,423 71 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 The purchase price allocation resulted in $7.4 million of identifiable intangible assets and $9.9 million of goodwill. As the ThingMagic acquisition was treated as an acquisition of assets for income tax purposes, the goodwill acquired is expected to be fully deductible for tax purposes. Intangible assets are being amortized over their weighted averag e useful lives primarily based upon the pattern in which anticipated economic benefits from such assets are expected to be realized. The goodwill recorded represents the anticipated incremental value of future cash flows potentially attributable to: (i) Th ingMagic’s ability to grow its business with existing and new customers, including leveraging the Company’s customer base; (ii) cost synergies in combining the research and development capabilities from ThingMagic with the existing RFID capabilities within Novanta; and (iii) cost improvements due to the integration of ThingMagic operations into the Company’s existing infrastructure. The operating results of ThingMagic were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on January 10, 2017. ThingMagic is included in the Company’s Vision reportable segment. The pro forma financial information reflecting the operating results of ThingMagic, as if it had been acquired as of January 1, 2016, would not differ materially from the operating results of the Company as reported for the year ended December 31, 2016. Unaudited Pro Forma Information The unaudited pro forma information presented below includes the effects of business combination accounting resulting from the acquisitions of WOM and Laser Quantum, including amortization of intangible assets, interest expense on borrowings in connection with the acquisitions, and elimination of the gain from the Laser Quantum acquisition and income from the Company’s previous equity method investment in Laser Quantum, and the related tax effects, as though the acquisitions had been consummated as of January 1, 2016. The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2016. Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenue $ 562,818 $ 487,960 Consolidated net income $ 39,630 $ 21,020 Earnings per share attributable to Novanta Inc. - Basic (1) $ 0.49 $ 0.62 Earnings per share attributable to Novanta Inc. - Diluted (1) $ 0.49 $ 0.61 (1) The computation of pro forma earnings per share attributable to Novanta Inc. included $20.2 million and zero adjustment of redeemable noncontrolling interest to estimated redemption value for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 were adjusted to exclude non-recurring items such as amortization of inventory fair value adjustments of $4.4 million, acquisition related costs of $4.3 million, the gain on business acquisition of $26.4 million and income from equity method investment of $0.1 million. Pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 were adjusted to include an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $5.3 million and an increase in interest expense of $1.4 million associated with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisitions. Pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 were adjusted to exclude non-recurring items such as acquisition related costs of $1.2 million and income from equity method investment of $2.2 million. Pro forma earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 were adjusted to include an increase in amortization of intangible assets of $12.5 million and an increase in interest expense of $3.9 million associated with borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility used to fund the acquisitions. 2016 Acquisitions Reach On May 24, 2016, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Reach Technology Inc. (“Reach”), a Fremont, California-based provider of embedded touch screen technology solutions for OEMs in the medical and advanced industrial markets, for a total purchase price of $9.4 million. The operating results of Reach were included in the Company’s results of operations beginning on May 24, 2016. Reach is included in the Company’s Vision reportable segment. 72 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Acquisition Costs The Company recognized acquisition costs of $1.1 million, $4.4 million and $0.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the acquisitions that occurred during those years. These costs consisted of finders’ fees, legal, valuation and other professional or consulting fees. These amounts were included in restructuring, acquisition and divestiture related costs in the consolidated statements of operations. 5. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest As a result of the Company’s acquisition of additional outstanding shares of Laser Quantum from the remaining shareholders on January 10, 2017, the Company increased its ownership position in Laser Quantum from approximately 41% to approximately 76% and began to consolidate Laser Quantum in the consolidated financial statements. As part of the purchase agreement, the Company and the remaining shareholders entered into a call and put option agreement for the purchase and sale, in 2020, of all remaining Laser Quantum shares held by the remaining shareholders, subject to certain conditions. As a result of the put option held by the remaining shareholders, the noncontrolling interest was considered a redeemable equity instrument and was presented as temporary equity on the consolidated balance sheet. The proportionate share of the net income from Laser Quantum attributable to the noncontrolling interest was reported as a reduction to the consolidated net income in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations and an increase to the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest. The initial value of the noncontrolling interest was measured at a fair value of £17.7 million ($21.6 million) as of January 10, 2017. On the consolidated balance sheet, the Company reported the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the higher of (i) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments or (ii) the estimated redemption value as of the end of the reporting period. The estimated redemption value was determined as of the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the instrument. The resulting adjustments were recorded in retained earnings in shareholders’ equity and did not affect net income attributable to Novanta Inc. However, these adjustments were included in the determination of earnings per common share (See Note 10). On September 27, 2018, the Company acquired the remaining approximately 24% of the outstanding shares of Laser Quantum for an aggregate consideration of $45.1 million, consisting of $30.7 million of cash and 213,219 shares of the Company’s restricted stock. The restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of certain milestones included in the restricted stock agreement. Restricted stock not otherwise vested as of December 31, 2025 will be subject to forfeiture. The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among shareholders. No gain or loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The difference between the carrying amount on the balance sheet prior to the acquisition of the redeemable noncontrolling interest and the purchase price was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings in stockholders’ equity. The following table summarizes the changes in the Company’s redeemable noncontrolling interest in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 46,923 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest 1,986 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment (1,781 ) Foreign currency translation (1,926 ) Acquisition of noncontrolling interest (45,202 ) Balance as of December 31, 2018 $ — 73 NOVANTA INC.

Fair Value Measurements ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement,” establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the third is considered unobservable: Level 1: Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets which the Company can access Level 2: Observable inputs other than those described in Level 1 Level 3: Unobservable inputs Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, which represent an asset the Company measures at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company determines the fair value of cash equivalents using a market approach based on quoted prices in active markets. The fair values of cash, accounts receivable, income taxes receivable, accounts payable, income taxes payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their carrying values because of their short-term nature. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts as a part of its strategy to manage exposures related to foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. 76 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Contingent Consideration On December 14, 2016, the Company acquired certain video signal processing and management technologies used in medical visualization solutions. Under the purchase and sale agreement, the owners are eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets from 2018 to 2021. The undiscounted range of possible contingent consideration is zero to €5.5 million ($6.6 million). If such targets are achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in four installments from 2019 to 2022. As the acquired assets did not meet the definition of a business, the fair value of the contingent consideration is recognized when probable and estimable and is capitalized as part of the cost of the acquired assets. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of this contingent liability are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the asset acquired and amortized over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. In December 2017, the Company recorded an estimated fair value of $1.3 million in contingent consideration, which was reported as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. Based on 2018 revenue performance and the most recent revenue projections for fiscal years 2019 to 2021, the fair value of the contingent consideration was adjusted to $3.4 million, which is reported as a long-term liability in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. On February 19, 2015, the Company acquired Applimotion Inc. (“Applimotion”). Under the purchase and sale agreement for the Applimotion acquisition, the shareholders of Applimotion were eligible to receive contingent consideration based on the achievement of certain revenue targets for fiscal years 2015 to 2017. If such targets were achieved, the contingent consideration would be payable in cash in two installments in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The estimated initial fair value of the contingent consideration of $1.0 million was determined based on the Monte Carlo valuation method and was recorded as part of the purchase price as of the acquisition date. As a result of Applimotion’s fiscal year 2015 and 2016 revenue results, contingent consideration of $1.2 million was paid in the first quarter of 2017. Based on Applimotion’s fiscal year 2016 and 2017 revenue results, the fair value for the remaining contingent consideration was adjusted to $2.8 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company paid $2.8 million as the final Applimotion contingent consideration payment in January 2018. The following table summarizes the fair values of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Quoted Prices in Significant Other Active Markets for Significant Other Unobservable Identical Assets Observable Inputs Inputs Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) Assets Cash equivalents $ 4,288 $ 4,288 $ — $ — Prepaid expenses and other current assets: Foreign currency forward contracts 15 — 15 — $ 4,303 $ 4,288 $ 15 $ — Liabilities Accrued expenses and other current liabilities: Foreign currency forward contracts $ 182 $ — $ 182 $ — Other liabilities: Contingent consideration - Long-term 3,376 — — 3,376 $ 3,558 $ — $ 182 $ 3,376 77 NOVANTA INC.

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no transfers between fair value levels. Changes in the fair value of Level 3 contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2018 were as follows (in thousands): Contingent Consideration Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 4,104 Payments (2,800 ) Fair value adjustments 2,072 Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 3,376 As of December 31, 2018, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s contingent consideration were historical revenues, projected revenues and a discount rate. Increases or decreases in the unobservable inputs would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. See Note 12 for discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt and Note 14 for discussion of the estimated fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets. 9. Foreign Currency Contracts The Company addresses market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to mitigate certain foreign currency transaction exposures from future settlement of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of a period. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on the underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, the Company manages its exposure to counterparty risks on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. Beginning in September 2017, the Company commenced a foreign currency hedging program through the use of forward contracts as a part of its strategy to limit its exposures related to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the 78 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries. These forward contracts are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. All changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in income before income taxes . As of December 31, 2018, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $31.2 million and a net loss of $0.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the notional amount and fair value of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts was $17.9 million and a net gain of $0.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized aggregate net gains of $1.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which were included in foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) in the consolidated statements of operations. 10. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Novanta Inc., after redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The Company recognizes changes in the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value by adjusting the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest as of the end of the period to the higher of: (i) the estimated redemption value assuming the end of the period is also the redemption date or (ii) the carrying value without any redemption value adjustments. Such adjustments are recorded in retained earnings in stockholders’ equity instead of net income attributable to Novanta Inc. For both basic and diluted earnings per common share, such redemption value adjustments are included in the calculation of the numerator. For diluted earnings per common share, the denominator also includes the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units, stock options, non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units and total shareholder return performance-based restricted stock units determined using the treasury stock method. Dilutive effects of attainment-based contingently issuable shares granted to the former Laser Quantum noncontrolling interest shareholders and the non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units will be included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation when the performance targets have been achieved. The dilutive effects of market-based contingently issuable shares are included in the weighted average dilutive share calculation based on the number of shares, if any, that would be issuable as of the end of the reporting period. For years in which net losses are generated, the dilutive potential common shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Numerators: Consolidated net income $ 51,095 $ 62,307 $ 22,003 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest (1,986 ) (2,256 ) — Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. 49,109 60,051 22,003 Redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment (see Note 5) 1,781 (20,244 ) — Net income attributable to Novanta Inc. after adjustment for redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value $ 50,890 $ 39,807 $ 22,003 Denominators: Weighted average common shares outstanding— basic 34,913 34,817 34,694 Dilutive potential common shares 560 463 220 Weighted average common shares outstanding— diluted 35,473 35,280 34,914 Antidilutive common shares excluded from above 4 — 85 Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Novanta Inc.: Basic $ 1.46 $ 1.14 $ 0.63 Diluted $ 1.43 $ 1.13 $ 0.63 79 NOVANTA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 commitments under the revolving credit facility rangi ng between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum, which is based upon the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains various customary representations, warranties and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries, including: (i) limitations on restricted payments, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, provided that the Company and its subsidiaries may repurchase their equity interests, so long as immediately after giving effect to the repurchase, the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio is no more than 2.50; (ii) limitations on fundamental changes involving the Company and its subsidiaries; (iii) limitations on the disposition of assets; and (iv) limitations on indebtedness, investments, and liens. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also requires the Company to satisfy certain financial covenants, such as maintaining a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.50 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of 3.00. The maximum consolidated leverage ratio will increase to 3.50 for four consecutive quarters following an acquisition with an aggregate consideration greater than or equal to $50.0 million. On August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Third Amendment increased the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility from $225 million to $325 million and reset the uncommitted accordion feature to $125 million for potential future expansion. Additionally, the Third Amendment increased the term loan balance from $65.6 million to $90.6 million. Under the Third Amendment, the Company is required to pay quarterly scheduled principal repayments of $2.3 million beginning in October 2017, with the final installment of $56.1 million due upon maturity in May 2021. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at any time through May 2021, the date of maturity of the Senior Credit Facilities. The Company may voluntarily prepay loans or reduce commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, subject to certain minimum principal amounts. On February 26, 2018, the Company entered into a fourth amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio from 3.00 to 3.50, increased the maximum consolidated leverage ratio for permitted acquisitions and stock repurchases from 2.50 to 3.00, increased the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio for a designated acquisition from 3.00 to 3.50, and increased the maximum permitted leverage ratio for four consecutive quarters following a designated acquisition from 3.50 to 4.00.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had $189.9 million available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. Excluding commitment fees, the weighted average interest rate for the Senior Credit Facilities was approximately 3.37% as of December 31, 2018.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 due and punctual perf ormance of all obligations of the Company in accordance with the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, each Guarantor, jointly and severally, unconditionally guarantees that in the event of any extension, renewal, amendmen t, refinancing or modification of any of the Senior Credit Facilities, amounts due will be promptly paid in full when due in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. The obligations of each Guarantor are limited to the maximum amount, after giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities or any collections from, or payments made by or on behalf of, any other Guarantor. Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under a Guarantee is entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor of its pro rata share based on the adjusted net assets of each Guarantor. If at any time any payment of any of the obligations of the Guarantors is rescinded or must otherwise be returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company, a Guarantor or otherwise, the Guarantees will continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, as though such payment had not been made. Each Guarantor may be released from its obligations under its respective Guarantee and its obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including, but not limited to: (i) the Guarantor ceasing to be a subsidiary; and (ii) payment in full of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the Senior Credit Facilities and all other obligations. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Guarantors could be required to make under the Guarantee is the principal amount of the Senior Credit Facilities plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. However, as of December 31, 2018, the Guarantors were not expected to be required to perform under the Guarantee. Liens The Company’s obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities are secured, on a senior basis, by a lien on substantially all of the assets of Novanta Inc., Novanta Corporation, NDS Surgical Imaging LLC, Novanta Europe GmbH, Novanta UK Investments Holding Limited and Novanta Technologies UK Limited. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. Deferred Financing Costs The Company capitalized deferred financing costs related to the execution of the Third Amendment dated August 1, 2017, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated May 19, 2016 and the amended and restated credit agreement dated December 27, 2012. The Company allocated the deferred financing costs between the term loan and the revolving credit facility based on the maximum borrowing capacity and amortizes the costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the Senior Credit Facilities. Non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the deferred financing costs was $1.0 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs are presented as a reduction to the debt balances on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value of Debt As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance of the Company’s debt approximated its fair value based on current rates available to the Company for debt of the same maturities. The fair value of the Company’s debt is classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy. 13.

During 2018, the Company repurchased 89 thousand shares in the open market for an aggregate purchase price of $5.9 million at an average price of $65.43 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased an aggregate of 385 thousand shares for an aggregate purchase price of $10.0 million at an average price of $25.97 per share. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had completed the 2013 Repurchase Plan. In October 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan (the “2018 Repurchase Plan”) authorizing the repurchase of an additional $25.0 million worth of common shares. Under the 2018 Repurchase Plan, shares may be repurchased from time to time, at the Company’s discretion, based on ongoing assessment of the capital needs of the business, the market price of the Company’s common stock, and general market conditions. Shares may also be repurchased through an accelerated stock purchase agreement, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Repurchases may be made under certain SEC regulations, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company would otherwise be prohibited from doing so under insider trading laws. The 2018 Repurchase Plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock. No time limit was set for the completion of the 2018 Repurchase Plan, and the plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company expects to fund the share repurchases through cash on hand and future cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2018, no shares had been repurchased under the 2018 Repurchase Plan. 2010 Incentive Award Plan In November 2010, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2010 Incentive Award Plan (the “2010 Incentive Plan”) under which the Company may grant share-based compensation awards to employees, consultants and directors. In May 2014, the Company’s stockholders approved the amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan and, in July 2016, the Company approved a further amended and restated 2010 Incentive Award Plan (as amended, the “Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan”). The maximum number of shares which can be issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan is 4,398,613, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock, deferred stock units, dividend equivalents, performance awards and stock payments (collectively referred to as “Awards”). The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan provides for specific limits on the number of shares with respect to Awards that may be granted to any person during any calendar year and the amount of cash that can be paid with respect to Awards to any one person during any calendar year. The Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan will expire and no further Awards may be granted after April 9, 2024. As of December 31, 2018, there were 950,865 shares available for future awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. Shares subject to Awards that have expired, forfeited or settled in cash, or repurchased by the Company at the same price paid by the awardee may be added back to the number of shares available for grant under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan and may be granted as new Awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shares will not be added back to the number of shares available for grant: (a) shares that are used to pay the exercise price for an option, (b) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to any Award (other than options and stock appreciation rights) to the extent they exceed the number of shares with a fair market value equal to the tax liability based on minimum withholding rates, (c) shares tendered or withheld to pay taxes with respect to options and stock appreciation rights, (d) shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and (e) shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options. Shares issued to satisfy Awards under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan may be previously authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares or shares repurchased on the open market. 84 NOVANTA INC.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s outstanding equity awards for which compensation expense will be recognized in the future consist of time-based restricted stock units, performance stock units, and stock options granted under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan. The Company expects to record an aggregate share-based compensation expense of $13.1 million, net of estimated forfeitures, over a weighted average period of 2.24 years subsequent to December 31, 2018, for all outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2018. Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units The Company’s restricted stock units (“RSUs”) have generally been issued with vesting periods ranging from three years to five years and vest based solely on service conditions. Accordingly, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company reduces the compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate which is based on anticipated forfeitures and actual experience. Deferred stock units (“DSUs”) are granted to the members of the Company’s Board of Directors. The compensation expense associated with the DSUs is recognized in full on the respective date of grant, as DSUs are fully vested and non-forfeitable upon grant. The table below summarizes activities relating to restricted and deferred stock units issued and outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during 2018: Restricted and Deferred Stock Units (In thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (1) (In thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2017 614 $ 18.35 Granted 130 $ 55.27 Vested (188 ) $ 18.77 Forfeited (27 ) $ 24.53 Unvested at December 31, 2018 529 $ 26.98 1.59 years $ 33,308 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2018 509 $ 26.31 1.59 years $ 32,041 (1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $63.00 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2018 due to the fact that the restricted stock units carry a $0 purchase price. The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested in 2018 and deferred stock units that were granted and vested in 2018, based on the market price of the underlying stock on the day of vesting, was $10.5 million. Performance Stock Units The Company granted two types of performance-based stock awards to certain members of the executive management team: non-GAAP EPS performance-based restricted stock units (“EPS-PSUs”) and relative total shareholder return performance-based restricted 85 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 stock units (“TSR-PSUs”). Both types of performa nce-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest on the first day following the end of the three-year performance period . The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the EPS-PSUs is determined based on the Company’s cumulative non-GAAP EPS over the three-year performance period against the target established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the performance period based on the number of shares that are deemed probable of vesting at the end of the three-year performance cycle. This probability assessment is performed quarterly and the cumulative effect of a change in the estimated compensation expense, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the period in which such determination is made. The number of common shares to be issued upon settlement following vesting of the TSR-PSUs is determined based on the relative market performance of the Company’s common stock compared to the Russell 2000 Index over the three-year performance period using a payout formula established by the Company’s Board of Directors at the time of grant and will be in the range of zero to 200% of the target number of shares. The Company recognizes the related compensation expense based on the fair value of the TSR-PSUs, determined using Monte-Carlo valuation model as of the grant date, on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the three-year performance period. Compensation expense will not be affected by the number of TSR-PSUs that will actually vest at the end of the three-year performance period. The table below summarizes activities relating to performance-based stock awards issued and outstanding under the Company’s Amended and Restated 2010 Incentive Plan during 2018: Performance Stock Units (1) (in thousands) Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted Average Remaining Vesting Period (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (2) (in thousands) Unvested at December 31, 2017 89 $ 24.00 Granted 48 $ 62.17 Vested — $ — Forfeited — $ — Unvested at December 31, 2018 137 $ 37.28 1.14 years $ 8,645 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2018 167 $ 33.21 1.14 years $ 10,491 (1) The unvested PSUs are shown in this table at target, except for the number of shares vested, which reflect the shares earned and number of shares expected to vest. As of December 31, 2018, the maximum number of PSUs available to be earned is approximately 274 thousand. (2) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated based on the fair value of $63.00 per share of the Company’s common stock on December 31, 2018 due to the fact that the performance stock units carry a $0 purchase price. The fair value of the TSR-PSUs at the date of grant was estimated using the Monte-Carlo valuation model with the following assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Grant-date stock price $ 53.85 Expected volatility 30.35 % Risk-free interest rate 2.37 % Expected annual dividend yield — Weighted average fair value $ 70.49 Stock Options On March 30, 2016, the Company granted 193 thousand stock options to certain members of the executive management team to purchase common shares of the Company at a price equal to the closing market price of the Company’s common shares on the date of grant. The stock options vest ratably on the anniversary date of the grant date over a three-year period and expire on the tenth anniversary of the grant date. The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input 86 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 assumptions used to estimate the fair value of s tock options include the expected option term, the expected volatility of the Company’s common stock over the expected term of the options, the risk-free interest rate, and the expected dividend yield. The Company recognizes the compensation expense of sto ck options on a straight-line basis in the consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period. No stock options were granted or exercised during 20 18 .

Employee Benefit Plans Defined Contribution Plans The Company has defined contribution employee savings plans in the U.K., Japan, and the U.S. The Company matches the contributions of participating employees on the basis of percentages specified in each plan. Company matching contributions to the plans were $3.9 million, $3.1 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Defined Benefit Plans The Company maintains a frozen defined benefit pension plan in the United Kingdom (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan was closed to new membership in 1997 and stopped accruing additional pension benefits for existing members in 2003. Benefits under the U.K. Plan were based on the employees’ years of service and compensation as of the date the plan was frozen in 2003, adjusted for inflation. The Company continues to fund the plan in accordance with the pension regulations in the U.K. and based on periodic agreements with the trustees of the U.K. Plan. The net periodic pension cost consisted of the following components (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Components of the net periodic pension cost: Interest cost $ 939 $ 991 $ 1,232 Expected return on plan assets (1,717 ) (1,665 ) (1,566 ) Amortization of actuarial losses 826 1,045 726 Net periodic pension cost $ 48 $ 371 $ 392 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Weighted-average discount rate 2.4 % 2.6 % 3.8 % Weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.8 % 5.2 % 5.3 % 87 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 The actuarial assumptions used to compute the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Weighted-average discount rate 2.7 % 2.4 % Rate of inflation 2.8 % 2.9 % The discount rates used are derived from (AA) corporate bonds that have maturities approximating the terms of the pension obligations under the U.K. Plan. In estimating the expected return on plan assets, the Company considered the historical performance of the major asset classes held by the U.K. Plan and current forecasts of future rates of return for these asset classes. The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets of the U.K. Plan (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Change in benefit obligation: Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 40,329 $ 37,261 Interest cost 939 991 Actuarial (gains) losses (1,718 ) (27 ) Benefits paid (1,301 ) (1,313 ) Prior service cost (1) 754 — Foreign currency exchange rate changes (2,121 ) 3,417 Projected benefit obligation at end of year $ 36,882 $ 40,329 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 36,882 $ 40,329 Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 36,476 $ 31,304 Actual return on plan assets (1,083 ) 2,605 Employer contributions 941 887 Benefits paid (1,301 ) (1,313 ) Foreign currency exchange rate changes (1,909 ) 2,993 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 33,124 $ 36,476 Funded status at end of year $ (3,758 ) $ (3,853 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic pension cost: Net actuarial losses at beginning of year $ (10,493 ) $ (11,697 ) Net actuarial gains (losses) during the year (1,082 ) 967 Prior service cost arising during the year (1) (754 ) — Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to income before income taxes 826 1,045 Foreign currency exchange rate changes 383 (808 ) Net actuarial loss $ (11,120 ) $ (10,493 ) Amounts expected to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic pension cost over the next fiscal year consists of: Net actuarial loss $ 959 $ 957 Prior service cost 29 — (1) On October 26, 2018, the High Court of Justice in the U.K. ruled that the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (“GMPs”) provided by pension schemes need to equalize lifetime GMP benefits between genders. In order to meet the requirements set out by the High Court, the Company recorded an estimate of $0.8 million additional benefit obligations based on the existing plan participants, the date the U.K. Plan was allowed to stop accruing additional benefits, the pension plan rules and the approach taken to equalize the benefits. The additional benefit obligation will 88 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 be amortized and recognized as part of net periodic pension cost in the consolidated statement of operations over the average remaining life expect ancy of the plan participants. The funded status of the U.K. Plan is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The following table reflects the total expected benefit payments to plan participants and have been estimated based on the same assumptions used to measure the Company’s benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Amount 2019 $ 859 2020 1,133 2021 1,197 2022 1,038 2023 1,137 2024-2026 8,370 Total $ 13,734 In the U.K., funding valuations are conducted every three years in order to determine the future level of contributions. Based on the results of the most recent valuation, the Company’s annual contributions will be approximately $0.9 million in 2019 and will increase by 2.9% per year thereafter. Fair Value of Plan Assets The trustees of the U.K. Plan have the fiduciary responsibilities to manage the plan assets in consultation with the Company. The overall objective is to invest plan assets in a portfolio of diversified assets, primarily through the use of institutional collective funds, to achieve balanced growth through a combination of investments in equities for long-term growth and investments in debt instruments that match a portion of the expected future benefit payments and to maintain adequate liquidity to make pension payments to pensioners.

The Tax Reform Act significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system, providing a one-time transition tax on the repatriation of foreign earnings (the “Toll Charge”), creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense and modifying the limitation on officer compensation. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2017 at the new 21% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Because of the ownership structure of the Company, the Company’s foreign entities outside the U.S. are not considered controlled foreign corporations of the U.S. company, as defined under U.S. tax principles, and accordingly, the accumulated earnings of these foreign subsidiaries are not subject to the one-time Toll Charge or global intangible low-taxed income (the “GILTI”) under the Tax Reform Act. In addition, the Company is not currently subject to the base erosion anti-abuse tax (the “BEAT”) as the Company’s revenue is below the threshold requirement under the Tax Reform Act. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes made to the provisional amounts recognized in 2017 in connection with the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act is completed as of December 31, 2018. 91 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 Deferred income taxes result principally from temporary differences in the recognition of certain revenue and expense items and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for financial and tax reporting purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 201 8 and 201 7 are as follows (in thousands): December 31, 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets: Losses $ 9,385 $ 9,407 Compensation related deductions 4,780 3,687 Inventories 4,170 3,400 Tax credits 2,785 2,594 Unrealized currency gains/losses — 183 Restructuring related liabilities 202 172 Warranty 35 768 Other 885 — Total deferred tax assets 22,242 20,211 Valuation allowance on deferred tax assets (12,884 ) (12,811 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 9,358 $ 7,400 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation $ (1,867 ) $ (1,353 ) Amortization (20,258 ) (23,496 ) Unrealized currency gains/losses (373 ) — Other — (1,171 ) Total deferred tax liabilities $ (22,498 ) $ (26,020 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ (13,140 ) $ (18,620 ) In determining its income tax provisions, the Company calculated deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate jurisdiction. The Company then considered a number of factors, including positive and negative evidence related to the realization of its deferred tax assets, to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to its deferred tax assets. In 2018, the Company recorded an additional $0.4 million valuation allowance associated with an increase in deferred tax assets in Canada. In 2018, the Company released valuation allowance of $0.3 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. In 2017, the Company released valuation allowance of $0.4 million recorded on net operating losses and other timing items in certain tax jurisdictions. Valuation allowance continues to be provided on the remaining balances of certain U.S. state net operating losses and certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. In conjunction with the Company’s ongoing review of its actual results and anticipated future earnings, the Company continuously reassesses the possibility of releasing the valuation allowance currently in place on its deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.7 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $0.7 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2037; and $3.0 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2033. In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $5.2 million and $0.5 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.7 million (tax effected) available to reduce future taxable income. Of this amount, approximately $1.0 million relates to the U.S. and expires through 2036; and $2.7 million relates to Canada and expires starting in 2032. In addition, the Company had capital loss carryforwards of $5.7 million, which had a full valuation allowance. Of this amount, $5.2 million and $0.5 million related to Canada and the U.K, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.8 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $0.9 million relates to the U.S. state tax credits, of which $0.8 million will expire through 2033 and $0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $1.2 million expires through 2022 and $0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. 92 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 As of Dec ember 31, 2017, the Company had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2.6 million available to reduce income taxes in future years. Approximately $0.7 million relates to the U.S. state tax attributes, of which $0.6 million will expire through 2032 and $0.1 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining $1.9 million tax credit carryforwards were related to Canada, of which $1.2 million expires through 2022 and $0.7 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recognized on the excess of the amount for financial reporting purposes over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in nature. This amount becomes taxable upon a repatriation of assets from a subsidiary or a sale or liquidation of a subsidiary. The amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries totaled $135.6 million as of December 31, 2018. However, these undistributed earnings are generally not subject to the repatriation taxes under the Tax Reform Act. The estimated unrecognized income tax and foreign withholding tax liability on this temporary difference is approximately $0.3 million. As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.7 million, of which $3.6 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $0.5 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all income tax uncertainties. As of December 31, 2017, the Company’s total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.1 million, of which $3.4 million would favorably affect the effective tax rate if benefited. Over the next twelve months, the Company may need to record up to $0.2 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits due to statute of limitations closures. The Company believes there are no jurisdictions in which the outcome of unresolved issues or claims is likely to be material to its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Furthermore, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all income tax uncertainties. The reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in thousands): Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 5,490 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 561 Additions for tax positions of prior years 88 Reductions to tax positions of prior years (45 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (842 ) Settlements with tax authorities (290 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 4,962 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 991 Additions for tax positions of prior years 496 Reductions to tax positions of prior years (28 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (1,577 ) Settlements with tax authorities (755 ) Balance at December 31, 2017 4,089 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 394 Additions for tax positions of prior years 655 Reductions to tax positions of prior years (69 ) Reductions to tax positions resulting from a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations (239 ) Settlements with tax authorities (105 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 4,725 The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had approximately $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized less than $0.1 million of expense for an increase in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. 93 NOVANTA INC.

In total, eleven facilities have been exited as part of the 2011 restructuring plan. The Company substantially completed the 2011 restructuring program in 2013. In March 2016, the Company sold its previously exited Laser Systems facility located in Orlando, Florida for cash at the net carrying value of $3.5 million. In December 2016, the lease agreement for the Company’s previously exited laser scanner business facility was terminated, which resulted in a benefit of $0.2 million.

These purchase commitments are expected to be incurred as follows: $93.9 million in 2019 and $5.1 million in 2020. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company reviews the status of each significant matter and assesses the potential financial exposure on a quarterly basis. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accrues a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet. As additional information becomes available, the Company reassesses the potential liability related to any pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates. The Company does not believe that the outcome of these claims will have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements but there can be no assurance that any such claims, or any similar claims, would not have a material adverse effect upon its consolidated financial statements. Guarantees and Indemnifications In the normal course of its operations, the Company executes agreements that provide for indemnification and guarantees to counterparties in transactions such as business dispositions, sale of assets, sale of products and operating leases. Additionally, the by-laws of the Company require it to indemnify certain current or former directors, officers, and employees of the Company against expenses incurred by them in connection with each proceeding in which he or she is involved as a result of serving or having served in certain capacities. Indemnification is not available with respect to a proceeding as to which it has been adjudicated that the person did not act in good faith in the reasonable belief that the action was in the best interests of the Company. Certain of the Company’s officers and directors are also a party to indemnification agreements with the Company. These indemnification agreements provide, among other things, that the director and officer shall be indemnified to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against all expenses, judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such officer or director in connection with any proceeding by reason of his or her relationship with the Company. In addition, the indemnification agreements provide for the advancement of expenses incurred by such director or officer in connection with any proceeding covered by the indemnification agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein and to the extent such advancement is not prohibited by law. The indemnification agreements also set out the procedures for determining entitlement to indemnification, the requirements relating to notice and defense of claims for which indemnification is sought, the procedures for enforcement of indemnification rights, the limitations on and exclusions from indemnification, and the minimum levels of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to be maintained by the Company. 97 NOVANTA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 On July 1, 2013, the Company provided a Guarantee (the “Guarantee”) in favor of the trustees of the U.K. Plan with respect to all present and future obligations and liabilities (whether actual or contingent and whether owed jointl y or severally and in any capacity whatsoever) of Novanta Technologies UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Novanta Inc. Credit Risks and Other Uncertainties The Company maintains financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables. From time to time, certain of these instruments may subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk whereby one institution may hold a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents, or one customer may represent a large portion of the accounts receivable balances. There was no significant concentration of credit risk related to the Company’s position in trade accounts receivable as no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is generally minimized because of the diversification of the Company’s operations, as well as its large customer base and its geographical dispersion. Certain of the components and materials included in the Company’s products are currently obtained from single source suppliers. There can be no assurance that a disruption of the supply of such components and materials would not create substantial manufacturing delays and additional cost to the Company. The Company’s operations involve a number of other risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, the effects of general economic conditions, rapidly changing technology, and international operations. 18. Related Party Transactions Certain members of the Company’s board of directors currently serve on the board of directors or as an advisor of companies that are customers of the Company. All contracts with related parties are executed at arm’s length in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate revenue from these customers was $40.0 million in 2018. There was $0.6 million in accounts receivable due from these customers as of December 31, 2018. There were no material transactions with related parties in 2017 or 2016. 19. Segment Information Reportable Segments The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) utilizes financial information to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. The Company evaluates the performance of, and allocates resources to, its segments based on revenue, gross profit and operating profit. The Company’s reportable segments have been identified based on commonality and adjacency of technologies, applications and customers amongst the Company’s individual product lines. The Company determined that disclosing revenue by specific product was impracticable due to the highly customized and extensive portfolio of technologies offered to customers. Based upon the information provided to the CODM, the Company has determined it operates in three reportable segments: Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion. The reportable segments and their principal activities consist of the following: Photonics The Photonics segment designs, manufactures and markets photonics-based solutions, including laser scanning, laser beam delivery, CO2 laser, continuous wave and ultrafast laser, and optical light engine products to customers worldwide.

World of Medicine GmbH (“WOM”) and Laser Quantum Limited (“Laser Quantum”) into our internal control over financial reporting and extending our Section 404 compliance program under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the applicable rules and regulations under such Act to include WOM and Laser Quantum. Except as otherwise described above, there has been no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making their assessment, our management utilized the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 2013. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework , issued by COSO in 2013, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 104 It em 9B.
