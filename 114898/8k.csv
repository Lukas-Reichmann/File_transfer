Novanta Inc. (Registrant) Date: November 5, 2019 By: /s/ Robert J. Buckley Robert J. Buckley Chief Financial Officer -;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 Novanta Announces Financial Results for the Third Quarter 2019 • Third Quarter 2019 GAAP Revenue of $154.1 million • Third Quarter 2019 GAAP Net Income of $8.9 million • Third Quarter 2019 GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.25 • Third Quarter 2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.53 • Third Quarter 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of $31.0 million BEDFORD, Mass., November 5, 2019 -- Novanta Inc. (Nasdaq: NOVT) (the “Company”), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2019. Financial Highlights Three Months Ended (In millions, except per share amounts) September 27, September 28, 2019 2018 GAAP Revenue $ 154.1 $ 160.8 Operating Income $ 12.8 $ 21.0 Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. $ 8.9 $ 14.6 Diluted EPS $ 0.25 $ 0.60 Non-GAAP* Adjusted Operating Income $ 25.6 $ 29.8 Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 0.53 $ 0.61 Adjusted EBITDA $ 31.0 $ 34.2 *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below. Third Quarter “We are pleased with the double-digit revenue growth from our sales to medical end markets, and the strong execution of our teams in a challenging industrial capital spending environment due to global trade uncertainties,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “We continue to execute on our long-term strategic growth plans, as was evident in the greater than 30% year-over-year growth in design wins during the quarter and our record level of revenue from new product introductions.” During the third quarter of 2019, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $154.1 million, a decrease of $6.7 million, or 4.2%, versus the third quarter of 2018. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $5.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year adversely impacted our revenue by $2.1 million, or 1.3%, during the third quarter of 2019. Our year-over-year Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was a decrease of 6.0% for the third quarter of 2019 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliation below). In the third quarter of 2019 , GAAP operating income was $12.8 million, compared to $21.0 million in the third quarter of 2018. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta was $8.9 million in the third quarter of 201 9 , compared to $ 14.6 million in the thir d quarter of 201 8 . GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0. 2 5 in the thir d quarter of 201 9 , compared to $0. 60 in the thir d quarter of 201 8 . Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.53 in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $0.61 in the third quarter of 2018. The Company ended the third quarter of 2019 with 35.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.0 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $34.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.0 million. The Company completed the third quarter of 2019 with approximately $227.5 million of total debt and $61.4 million of total cash. Net Debt, as defined in the non-GAAP reconciliation below, was $167.6 million. Financial Outlook “We feel Novanta is well positioned in an uncertain macro-economic environment. Our medical products continue to see strong momentum on the back of a robust innovation pipeline. In addition, while our fourth quarter is seeing some customers delay projects due to uncertainty in the industrial capital environment, we are seeing a strong opportunity funnel of new customer platforms and early recoveries of some industrial and electronics markets beginning to surface,” said Matthijs Glastra. For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $156 million to $158 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $30.5 million to $32.5 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Novanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); divestiture related expenses; acquisition related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses) on proceeds from divestitures; benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, November 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results. To access the call, please dial (888) 346-3959 prior to the scheduled conference call time. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Presentations and Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.novanta.com . A replay of the audio webcast will be available approximately three hours after the conclusion of the call on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.novanta.com . The replay will remain available until Monday, January 6, 2020. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income and Operating Margin, Adjusted Income before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. and Net Debt. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company also uses Adjusted Diluted EPS as a measurement for performance shares issued to certain executives. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.

The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin The calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin The calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. The Company also excluded restructuring and acquisition related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted Income before Income Taxes The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes is displayed in the tables above. The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin above. Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income before Income Taxes by jurisdiction and the applicable tax rates currently in effect for the respective jurisdictions. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax The calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is displayed in the tables above. Because pre-tax income is included in determining net income attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Diluted EPS The calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is displayed in the tables above. Because Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is used in the diluted EPS calculation, the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and acquisition related costs, significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax. In addition, the Company excluded the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment as (1) the adjustment is unusual; (2) the amount is noncash; (3) the amount does not represent a measure of earnings and is excluded from the determination of net income attributable to Novanta Inc.; and (4) the Company believes that investors may benefit from an understanding of the Company's operating results without giving effect to this adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the consolidated net income before deducting interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, other non-operating income (expense) items, including foreign exchange gains (losses) and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the results of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries and therefore does not exclude the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt, and to fund future growth. Net Debt The Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. * * * * -;-",0001076930,NOVT,"8-K: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): November 5, 2019 NOVANTA INC (Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter) New Brunswick, Canada 001-35083 98-0110412 (State or other jurisdiction of incorporation) (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 125 Middlesex Turnpike Bedford , Massachusetts 01730 (Address of principal executive offices) (Zip Code) Registrant’s telephone number, including area code: ( 781 ) 266-5700 Not Applicable (Former name or former address, if changed since last report.)

Third Quarter “We are pleased with the double-digit revenue growth from our sales to medical end markets, and the strong execution of our teams in a challenging industrial capital spending environment due to global trade uncertainties,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “We continue to execute on our long-term strategic growth plans, as was evident in the greater than 30% year-over-year growth in design wins during the quarter and our record level of revenue from new product introductions.” During the third quarter of 2019, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $154.1 million, a decrease of $6.7 million, or 4.2%, versus the third quarter of 2018. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $5.0 million, or 3.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year adversely impacted our revenue by $2.1 million, or 1.3%, during the third quarter of 2019. Our year-over-year Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was a decrease of 6.0% for the third quarter of 2019 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliation below). In the third quarter of 2019 , GAAP operating income was $12.8 million, compared to $21.0 million in the third quarter of 2018. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta was $8.9 million in the third quarter of 201 9 , compared to $ 14.6 million in the thir d quarter of 201 8 . GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0. 2 5 in the thir d quarter of 201 9 , compared to $0. 60 in the thir d quarter of 201 8 . Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.53 in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $0.61 in the third quarter of 2018. The Company ended the third quarter of 2019 with 35.6 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.0 million in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $34.2 million in the third quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the third quarter of 2019 was $7.0 million. The Company completed the third quarter of 2019 with approximately $227.5 million of total debt and $61.4 million of total cash. Net Debt, as defined in the non-GAAP reconciliation below, was $167.6 million. Financial Outlook “We feel Novanta is well positioned in an uncertain macro-economic environment. Our medical products continue to see strong momentum on the back of a robust innovation pipeline. In addition, while our fourth quarter is seeing some customers delay projects due to uncertainty in the industrial capital environment, we are seeing a strong opportunity funnel of new customer platforms and early recoveries of some industrial and electronics markets beginning to surface,” said Matthijs Glastra. For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $156 million to $158 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $30.5 million to $32.5 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.54. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Novanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); divestiture related expenses; acquisition related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses) on proceeds from divestitures; benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Presentations and Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.novanta.com .

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income and Operating Margin, Adjusted Income before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. and Net Debt. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company also uses Adjusted Diluted EPS as a measurement for performance shares issued to certain executives. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.

The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin The calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin The calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. The Company also excluded restructuring and acquisition related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted Income before Income Taxes The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes is displayed in the tables above. The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin above. Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income before Income Taxes by jurisdiction and the applicable tax rates currently in effect for the respective jurisdictions. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax The calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is displayed in the tables above. Because pre-tax income is included in determining net income attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Diluted EPS The calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is displayed in the tables above. Because Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is used in the diluted EPS calculation, the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and acquisition related costs, significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax. In addition, the Company excluded the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment as (1) the adjustment is unusual; (2) the amount is noncash; (3) the amount does not represent a measure of earnings and is excluded from the determination of net income attributable to Novanta Inc.; and (4) the Company believes that investors may benefit from an understanding of the Company's operating results without giving effect to this adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the consolidated net income before deducting interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, other non-operating income (expense) items, including foreign exchange gains (losses) and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the results of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries and therefore does not exclude the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt, and to fund future growth. Net Debt The Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. * * * * "

Novanta Inc. (Registrant) Date: August 6, 2019 By: /s/ Robert J. Buckley Robert J. Buckley Chief Financial Officer -;-EX-99.1: Exhibit 99.1 Novanta Announces Financial Results for the Second Quarter 2019 • Second Quarter 2019 GAAP Revenue of $155.1 million • Second Quarter 2019 GAAP Net Income of $10.4 million • Second Quarter 2019 GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share of $0.29 • Second Quarter 2019 Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $0.54 • Second Quarter 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of $31.0 million BEDFORD, Mass., August 6, 2019 -- Novanta Inc. (Nasdaq: NOVT) (the “Company”), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the second quarter 2019. Financial Highlights Three Months Ended (In millions, except per share amounts) June 28, June 29, 2019 2018 GAAP Revenue $ 155.1 $ 150.4 Operating Income $ 15.1 $ 17.1 Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. $ 10.4 $ 11.0 Diluted EPS $ 0.29 $ 0.32 Non-GAAP* Adjusted Operating Income $ 25.8 $ 25.9 Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 0.54 $ 0.51 Adjusted EBITDA $ 31.0 $ 30.4 *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below. Second Quarter “Novanta delivered solid results in the second quarter, with good execution by our teams and solid progress on our strategic goals,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “We continue to see strong high-teens growth in our Medical businesses, mitigating the weakness in the broader Industrial capital equipment markets.” During the second quarter of 2019, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $155.1 million, an increase of $4.7 million, or 3.2%, versus the second quarter of 2018. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $1.7 million, or 1.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year adversely impacted our revenue by $3.0 million, or 2.0%, during the second quarter of 2019. Our year-over-year Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was 4.0% for the second quarter of 2019 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliation below). In the second quarter of 2019 , GAAP operating income was $15.1 million, compared to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta was $10.4 million in the second quarter of 201 9 , compared to $ 11.0 million in the second quarter of 201 8 . GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0. 29 in the second quarter of 201 9 , compared to $0. 32 in the second quarter of 201 8 . Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.54 in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $0.51 in the second quarter of 2018. The Company ended the second quarter of 2019 with 35.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2019 was $15.4 million. The Company completed the second quarter of 2019 with approximately $214.6 million of total debt and $66.1 million of total cash. Net Debt, as defined in the non-GAAP reconciliation below, was $150.2 million. Financial Outlook “Our third quarter is impacted by temporary lumpiness with a large in vitro diagnostics customer and a temporary slowdown in June bookings caused by the global trade uncertainties impacting Industrial end market sales,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “However, we expect to perform significantly better in our fourth quarter driven by growth in our Medical businesses and stronger bookings and backlog in our Advanced Industrial businesses, helping us exit the year with strong momentum.” For the third quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $154 million to $156 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $29 million to $31 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $166 million to $169 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $34 million to $36 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Novanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); divestiture related expenses; acquisition related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses) on proceeds from divestitures; benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, August 6, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results. To access the call, please dial (888) 346-3959 prior to the scheduled conference call time. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Presentations and Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.novanta.com .

The replay will remain available until Monday, October 7, 2019. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income and Operating Margin, Adjusted Income before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. and Net Debt. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company also uses Adjusted Diluted EPS as a measurement for performance shares issued to certain executives. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release.

The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin The calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin The calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. The Company also excluded restructuring and acquisition related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted Income before Income Taxes The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes is displayed in the tables above. The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin above. Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income before Income Taxes by jurisdiction and the applicable tax rates currently in effect for the respective jurisdictions. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax The calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is displayed in the tables above. Because pre-tax income is included in determining net income attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Diluted EPS The calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is displayed in the tables above. Because Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is used in the diluted EPS calculation, the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and acquisition related costs, significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax. In addition, the Company excluded the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment as (1) the adjustment is unusual; (2) the amount is noncash; (3) the amount does not represent a measure of earnings and is excluded from the determination of net income attributable to Novanta Inc.; and (4) the Company believes that investors may benefit from an understanding of the Company's operating results without giving effect to this adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the consolidated net income before deducting interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, other non-operating income (expense) items, including foreign exchange gains (losses) and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the results of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries and therefore does not exclude the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt, and to fund future growth. Net Debt The Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. * * * * -;-",0001076930,NOVT,"8-K: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): August 6, 2019 Novanta Inc.

(Nasdaq: NOVT) (the “Company”), a trusted technology partner to medical and advanced technology equipment manufacturers, today reported financial results for the second quarter 2019. Financial Highlights Three Months Ended (In millions, except per share amounts) June 28, June 29, 2019 2018 GAAP Revenue $ 155.1 $ 150.4 Operating Income $ 15.1 $ 17.1 Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. $ 10.4 $ 11.0 Diluted EPS $ 0.29 $ 0.32 Non-GAAP* Adjusted Operating Income $ 25.8 $ 25.9 Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 0.54 $ 0.51 Adjusted EBITDA $ 31.0 $ 30.4 *Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures, as well as definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release and the reasons for their use, are presented below. Second Quarter “Novanta delivered solid results in the second quarter, with good execution by our teams and solid progress on our strategic goals,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “We continue to see strong high-teens growth in our Medical businesses, mitigating the weakness in the broader Industrial capital equipment markets.” During the second quarter of 2019, Novanta generated GAAP revenue of $155.1 million, an increase of $4.7 million, or 3.2%, versus the second quarter of 2018. The Company’s acquisition activities resulted in an increase in revenue of $1.7 million, or 1.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2018. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year adversely impacted our revenue by $3.0 million, or 2.0%, during the second quarter of 2019. Our year-over-year Organic Revenue Growth, which excludes the net impact of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency exchange rates, was 4.0% for the second quarter of 2019 (see “Organic Revenue Growth” in the non-GAAP reconciliation below). In the second quarter of 2019 , GAAP operating income was $15.1 million, compared to $17.1 million in the second quarter of 2018. GAAP net income attributable to Novanta was $10.4 million in the second quarter of 201 9 , compared to $ 11.0 million in the second quarter of 201 8 . GAAP diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) was $0. 29 in the second quarter of 201 9 , compared to $0. 32 in the second quarter of 201 8 . Adjusted Diluted EPS was $0.54 in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $0.51 in the second quarter of 2018. The Company ended the second quarter of 2019 with 35.5 million weighted average shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $31.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to $30.4 million in the second quarter of 2018. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2019 was $15.4 million. The Company completed the second quarter of 2019 with approximately $214.6 million of total debt and $66.1 million of total cash. Net Debt, as defined in the non-GAAP reconciliation below, was $150.2 million. Financial Outlook “Our third quarter is impacted by temporary lumpiness with a large in vitro diagnostics customer and a temporary slowdown in June bookings caused by the global trade uncertainties impacting Industrial end market sales,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “However, we expect to perform significantly better in our fourth quarter driven by growth in our Medical businesses and stronger bookings and backlog in our Advanced Industrial businesses, helping us exit the year with strong momentum.” For the third quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $154 million to $156 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $29 million to $31 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.52. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. For the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company expects GAAP revenue of approximately $166 million to $169 million, Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $34 million to $36 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63. The Company’s Adjusted Diluted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA guidance assumes no significant changes in foreign exchange rates. Novanta provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide earnings guidance on a GAAP basis, with the exception of GAAP revenue guidance. A reconciliation of the Company’s forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS guidance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is not provided because of the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including future changes in the fair value of contingent considerations; significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits); divestiture related expenses; acquisition related expenses; impact of purchase price allocations for recently completed acquisitions; gains and losses from sale of real estate assets; costs related to product line closures; intangible asset impairment charges and related asset write-offs; future restructuring expenses; foreign exchange gains/(losses) on proceeds from divestitures; benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits; and other charges reflected in the Company’s reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures, the amounts of which, based on past experience, could be material. For additional information regarding Novanta’s non-GAAP financial measures, see “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Conference Call Information The Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, August 6, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results. To access the call, please dial (888) 346-3959 prior to the scheduled conference call time. Alternatively, the conference call can be accessed online via a live webcast on the Presentations and Events page of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.novanta.com .

The replay will remain available until Monday, October 7, 2019. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, Adjusted Operating Income and Operating Margin, Adjusted Income before Income Taxes, Adjusted Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate, Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Free Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc. and Net Debt. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and supplementary information to investors regarding the operating performance of the Company. It is management’s belief that these non-GAAP financial measures would be particularly useful to investors because of the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business in accordance with the execution of the Company’s strategy. This strategy includes streamlining the Company’s existing operations through site and functional consolidations, strategic divestitures and product line closures, expanding the Company’s business through significant internal investments, and broadening the Company’s product and service offerings through acquisition of innovative and complementary technologies and solutions. The financial impact of certain elements of these activities, particularly acquisitions, divestitures, and site and functional restructurings, is often large relative to the Company’s overall financial performance and can adversely affect the comparability of its operating results and investors’ ability to analyze the business from period to period. The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used by management to evaluate operating performance, communicate financial results to the Board of Directors, benchmark results against historical performance and the performance of peers, and evaluate investment opportunities, including acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA and Organic Revenue Growth are used to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. The Company also uses Adjusted Diluted EPS as a measurement for performance shares issued to certain executives. Accordingly, the Company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and insight into management’s method of analysis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. The non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables accompanying this press release. Safe Harbor and Forward-Looking Information Certain statements in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees, but involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

Other important risk factors that could affect the outcome of the events set forth in these statements and that could affect the Company’s operating results and financial condition are discussed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and in our future filings with the SEC.

The Company uses the related term “organic revenue growth” to refer to the financial performance metric of comparing current period organic revenue with the reported revenue of the corresponding period in the prior year. The Company believes that this non-GAAP measure, when taken together with our GAAP financial measures, allows the Company and its investors to better measure the Company’s performance and evaluate long-term performance trends. Organic revenue growth also facilitates easier comparisons of the Company’s performance with prior and future periods and relative comparisons to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from these measures because foreign currency translation is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because these activities can vary dramatically between reporting periods and between the Company and its peers, which the Company believes makes comparisons of long-term performance trends difficult for management and investors. Organic Revenue Growth is also used as a performance metric to determine bonus payments for senior management and employees. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin The calculation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin The calculation of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin is displayed in the tables above. Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets and inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions because: (1) the amounts are non-cash; (2) the Company cannot influence the timing and amount of future expense recognition; and (3) excluding such expenses provides investors and management better visibility into the components of operating costs. The Company also excluded restructuring and acquisition related costs due to the significant changes that have occurred outside of the Company’s day-to-day business for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted Income before Income Taxes The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes is displayed in the tables above. The calculation of Adjusted Income before Income Taxes excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs for the reasons described for Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin above. Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate The Non-GAAP Income Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate are calculated based on the Adjusted Income before Income Taxes by jurisdiction and the applicable tax rates currently in effect for the respective jurisdictions. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax The calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is displayed in the tables above. Because pre-tax income is included in determining net income attributable to Novanta Inc., net of tax, the calculation of Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, also excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, and restructuring and acquisition related costs. In addition, the Company excluded significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments discussed above. Adjusted Diluted EPS The calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS is displayed in the tables above. Because Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax, is used in the diluted EPS calculation, the calculation of Adjusted Diluted EPS excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets, inventory fair value adjustments related to business acquisitions, restructuring and acquisition related costs, significant discrete income tax expenses (benefits) related to releases of valuation allowances, benefits or expenses associated with the completion of tax audits, effects of changes in tax laws, effects of acquisition related tax planning actions on the Company’s effective tax rate, and the income tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments for the reasons described above for Adjusted Net Income Attributable to Novanta Inc., Net of Tax. In addition, the Company excluded the redeemable noncontrolling interest redemption value adjustment as (1) the adjustment is unusual; (2) the amount is noncash; (3) the amount does not represent a measure of earnings and is excluded from the determination of net income attributable to Novanta Inc.; and (4) the Company believes that investors may benefit from an understanding of the Company's operating results without giving effect to this adjustment. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as the consolidated net income before deducting interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash share-based compensation, restructuring and acquisition related costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, other non-operating income (expense) items, including foreign exchange gains (losses) and net periodic pension costs of the Company’s frozen U.K. defined benefit pension plan for the reasons described above in the introductory paragraphs of the “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Adjusted EBITDA includes 100% of the results of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries and therefore does not exclude the Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Revenue. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as, or similar to, some of the adjustments in this presentation. Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. The Company defines Free Cash Flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for purchases of property, plant and equipment and plus cash proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment. Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Net Income Attributable to Novanta, Inc. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are important indicators of the Company’s liquidity as well as its ability to service its outstanding debt, and to fund future growth. Net Debt The Company defines Net Debt as its total debt as reported on the consolidated balance sheet plus unamortized deferred financing costs and less its cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period presented. Management uses Net Debt to monitor the Company’s outstanding debt obligations that could not be satisfied by its cash and cash equivalents on hand. * * * * "
